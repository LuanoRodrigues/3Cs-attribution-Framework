In recent years, land-based cyber intrusions, hacks and data breaches, including ones against Equifax, Sony, the Democratic National Committee and the Office of Personnel Management, exposed masses of consumer data and compromised the networks of various private companies and governmental organizations. These significant events caused great harm to the organizations, the economy and the public. Cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for public and private organizations in recent years. However, the issue has not been meaningfully addressed among the international legal community, particularly within the space sector. If a hostile actor were to successfully infiltrate the networks of major satellite systems that orbit the Earth, which the world relies on for, among other things, communication, navigation, weather monitoring, national security and military operations, the consequences could be catastrophic. This Note addresses what sorts of cyber-attacks or intrusions to a satellite system would constitute a violation of international law and to what degree a State can respond and receive reparation for damage, either physical or otherwise, caused. It concludes that the application of currently accepted legal\n\n* Andrew Fois is a recent graduate of Georgetown University Law Center.

The Note applies the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force, the law of State responsibility, sovereignty and other principles of international law to hypothesize how the current international regime could address such a scenario. It concludes with the suggestion that: 1) the international space law community adopt cooperative and streamlined norms, standards and initiatives that are adaptable to constantly evolving technologies, including the formation of an international body dedicated to cyber issues in outer space that would bring all relevant parties together; and 2) within that framework consider implementing amendments to the space law treaties as a long-term goal.\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nWhen a powerful Soviet satellite armed with electromagnetic pulse weaponry falls into the wrong hands, British intelligence agents had to risk their lives to prevent the space-based weapon from incapacitating electricity-powered technologies on Earth in a destructive blast.¹ While this is the somewhat far-fetched plot of the 1995 James Bond film *Goldeneye*, the film illustrates the importance of artificial space-based satellites and the potential disaster that could result if a hostile actor gained control of one. Although no satellite capable of such mass destruction orbits the Earth currently, various military and civilian observation, communication, weather and navigational satellites, if compromised, could have similarly drastic consequences, particularly as satellite technologies advance and hostile intruders become more sophisticated, especially by utilizing Internet-based attacks.²\n\nThe problem of an artificial satellite becoming compromised due to a cyber intrusion of its network is not completely theoretical. In 2007 and 2008, several United States (US) military satellites were hacked through a ground station in Norway—the Chinese\n\n¹ See GOLDENEYE (United Artists 1995).\n\n² See William Akoto, *What Happens When All the Tiny Satellites We’re Shooting Into Space Get Hacked?*, FAST COMPANY (Feb. 15, 2020), https://www.fastcompany.com/90464666/what-happens-when-all-the-tiny-satellites-were-shooting-into-space-get-hacked.",

Now more than ever is the time to start taking cybersecurity more seriously.\n\nA major breach of certain satellite networks by sophisticated actors could have drastic effects, depending on the intentions of the intruder. For instance, the US military uses the USA 224 satellite for detailed spying all around the Earth for military activities.¹⁷ If that satellite were compromised, hackers could acquire invaluable and classified US intelligence, threaten US military operations and perhaps even manipulate the satellite's transmission to complete military objectives adverse to the interests of the US. Similarly, a hacker could also disrupt a geostationary weather satellite, such as the GOES series,¹⁸ causing weather prediction to be disrupted, or one of the many commercial telecommunications satellites that power critical infrastructure. Other disruptions could affect air traffic controls, cable and network television broadcasts, cell-phone communications, military intelligence and environmental monitoring.¹⁹ Current space law would likely never allow the launching of a satellite like Goldeneye with nuclear capabilities specifically designed as an electromagnetic weapon.²⁰ But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today.

The US capabilities demonstrably surpassed the Soviets with Apollo 8 orbiting the Moon and Apollo 11 putting humans on the Moon at the end of the decade.³³ In fact, the Moon landing may even have been a catalyst to the end of the Cold War and the cementing of the US’s advantage over the Soviets in the nuclear arms and space races.³⁴ Notably, the same technology used to launch Sputnik into space was intended by the Soviets as a way to deliver intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBMs).³⁵\n\nAt the same time, the Internet was developed largely as a reaction to the events of the Cold War.³⁶ The US military created\n\n³¹ See Bradley G.

If State and non-State actors⁵⁷ are capable of such major hacks on Earth-based systems, there is little stopping them from targeting satellites in space via the Internet.\n\nCurrent space law does not allow the placement of nuclear weapons or a weapon of mass destruction such as Goldeneye into orbit.⁵⁸ But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today, so it is crucial that space law can account for the fact that evolving technologies create new ways for hackers to access these systems. Today, most devices, including satellites, rely on the Internet, and with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), that will only increase.\n\nHistory shows that satellites are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which scholar P.

Although there is not conclusive proof, the indictment suggests the hack was part of a series of major data thefts organized by the People's Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence agencies.

HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN PREVENT AND PROVIDE REDRESS FOR A MAJOR CYBER-ATTACK ON A SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nA successful cyber-attack on a satellite could interfere with the space object’s flight control, payload control or transmission.¹⁰⁷ Because the Outer Space Treaty says that space activities are governed by international law,¹⁰⁸ if such an attack were to occur, the State or private company whose satellite was compromised would turn to international law to evaluate its response options and any potential recourse the attacker owes. The injured satellite operator will want assurances and effective enforcement measures from the law that discourage and disincentivize hostile actors from committing attacks.\n\n### A. Prevention and Risk Mitigation: How Hacking Satellites Violates International Law\n\nThe space law treaties say little specifically about how States can prevent against possible cyber military or terrorist attacks in space but are more concerned with the peaceful use and exploration of outer space for the “province of all [hu]mankind.”¹⁰⁹ However, there are various ways that general international law can be violated when a hacker invades a government or private satellite’s network.\n\nFirst, a cyber-attack, depending on its nature and scope, could qualify as a violation of international law because it is a prohibited “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.¹¹⁰ Second, a cyber-attack may constitute a violation of a State’s territorial\n\n---\n\n¹⁰⁷ See Elizabeth Howell, *What Is A Satellite?*, SPACE.COM (Oct. 27, 2017), https://www.space.com/24839-satellites.html.\n\n¹⁰⁸ Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. III.\n\n¹⁰⁹ *Id.* at art. I.\n\n¹¹⁰ See UN Charter art. 2(4). For instance, a hacker State could use prohibited force against another State directly by interfering with its weather or Internet communications, causing technology failures, transportation shutdowns, or emergency responses that would likely cause significant physical damage. This type of hack would more clearly qualify as a use of force because it resulted in physical damage, even if the hacker was not using armed force in the traditional sense. Alternatively, a more indirect use of force could be economic in nature, such as collapsing a State’s stock exchange system or financial institutions, which would be more difficult to show as a violation of the UN Charter.",

Cyber-Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite’s Network As a “Use of Force” Prohibited by the United Nations Charter\n\nWhether the UN’s prohibition against the use of force, and exception for self-defense measures, applies to cyberspace is generally unresolved by international law and highly dependent on each State’s particular interpretation of the Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter says that States may use force in self-defense or in anticipation of an impending attack “if an armed attack occurs.”¹¹² Although cyber activities are not “armed” in the traditional sense,¹¹³ a successful cyber operation against a satellite system could qualify as an armed attack under international law depending on the circumstances of the attack.¹¹⁴ The theory accepted by most States on Article 2(4)’s applicability in cyberspace argues that an attack may be deemed “armed” if its scope and effect are equivalent to that of a\n\n¹¹¹ A cyber-attack that crosses State borders, unlike traditional violations of territorial sovereignty, is more difficult to determine because of the intangible nature of cyberspace. If a hacker caused massive amounts of damage to another State across the globe, without ever actually setting foot in that State, it would be difficult to argue that the hacker violated traditional principles of sovereignty, which focuses on a State’s exclusive jurisdiction over physical territory. See supra note 100.\n\n¹¹² UN Charter arts. 2(4); see also art. 51 (permitting States to use force in self defense against an armed attack).\n\n¹¹³ See Benedikt Pirker, supra note 99.\n\n¹¹⁴ Id. Depending on the target, extent of damage, intentions of the attacker, and a variety of other factual circumstances, a cyber attack may or may not qualify as a “use of force” under the UN Charter. While hackers generally are not “armed” in the traditional sense of having physical weapons, they could cause massive damage to variety of information and communications systems through malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, zero-day exploits, or domain name system (DNS) tunnelling. See What is a Cyberattack? CISCO (last visited Sept. 6, 2022), https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html#-types-of-cyber-attacks.\n\nFor instance, a malware attack, commonly understood as a cyber-attack using malicious software to breach a network vulnerability and block access, install harmful software, steal data, or render the system inoperable, that shut down aviation systems could qualify as a prohibited use of force because it would cause massive damage to a State’s transportation infrastructure and was clearly intended to disrupt those communication systems. See id. By contrast, a man-in-the middle attack that merely eavesdrops and obtains information from an important government transaction may be damaging and potentially illegal, but would be less likely to qualify as a use of force under the UN Charter.

The ICJ has ruled on drawing this line in *Nicaragua v. United States* when it found that the US merely funding Nicaraguan guerillas who opposed their government did not use prohibited force against the State.¹²⁰ The US did use force, however, when it armed and trained those forces, even without any immediate physical effects.¹²¹ This case suggests that some additional, and intentional, steps must be taken by hackers beyond mere access for an intrusion to constitute a prohibited use of force under the effects test.

For one, cyberspace is run by physical servers and modems, and when a virus is transmitted to a network, it can be traced to a physical source.¹³⁷ Additionally, States can prevent others from accessing their content outside of the country because they have their own Internet regulators, filters and IP addresses.

Hackers will generally invade the physical server located on Earth that will then send signals and commands to the space-based object. So, even if satellites were not subject to national appropriation once launched into outer space, most hacking occurs on the Earth.

Often, a State is only suspected of sponsoring a cyberattack or is not even involved at all. For instance, in the OPM hack, the US government traced the source of the data breach to Chinese nationals but could not formally link them to the government, at least at first.¹⁵⁰ In this particular case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later charged four members of the Chinese military with the hack and explicitly tied the attack to Beijing.¹⁵¹ This case is an outlier because the US was very close to eventually being able to attribute the hackers to the Chinese government, though could not do so definitively, but in many cases, attribution to the State or even\n\n¹⁴⁷ See Stefan A.

Interpreting the Convention's language as applying to more intangible aggression in space goes directly against the treaty's plain text. Thus, the Liability Convention would not provide a remedy unless interpreted very broadly since any State or non-State actor that hacks a satellite network will almost certainly not be physically launching an object into space. However, the State could still take the responsible party to the ICJ or domestic courts because domestic law is really where most of the regulation on data security and violations of intellectual property exist, subject to the sovereign immunity exceptions, and could succeed in such a claim depending on the nature of the attack and amount of damage caused.\n\n## IV.

Adopting New Treaties or Amending the Current Rules\n\nIn theory, States could convene to create a new treaty or, at the very least, amend the current treaties to create broader language that is more suitable to addressing intangible cyber threats to satellite systems. For instance, the Liability Convention's requirement of a \"launching State\" does not account for anything other than physical damage caused by another State's launch.[167] However, this seemingly most obvious solution is probably the most unrealistic. First, completing this goal would be a long, arduous process with every State having different interests. Even if it succeeded, by the time a new treaty was adopted, the technology will no doubt out pace any agreement.[168] Additionally, there have been attempts to adopt new space-related treaties that have failed.[169] Amended treaties and additional international legal instruments that provide stronger cybersecurity protections may work temporarily but not long-term and would be met with much resistance.\n\n167 See Liability Convention, supra note 79, arts.

If adopting or amending a treaty is currently infeasible, perhaps the UN could impose declarations, principles, or even resolutions that reinterpret the UN Charter’s provisions to account for these new threats that the original drafters did not anticipate.

Both space law and cybersecurity law are new areas, and cybersecurity law has continued to evolve and change with technology while space law has remained relatively stagnant. The novelty of these areas of the law, along with the unique physical nature of space and the intangibility of cyberspace, makes it difficult to determine what sorts of cyber intrusions to space satellite systems violate international law. While there is no clear answer as to how exactly the international legal community should deal with this problem, plenty of authority stemming from traditional international law can be utilized. Additionally, States have several options moving forward to ensure the protection of these highly sensitive space-based systems and provide relief to victims of hacks. Although adopting new international legal instruments, or modifying the current ones, would be the ideal solution, it would be unlikely to garner much support considering the various interests of the various nations. Perhaps this can remain a long-term goal, but in the meantime, States should work cooperatively, with strong support from the private sector, to adopt international legal norms and practices in the form of declarations, principles, resolutions, State practice, and perhaps even the creation of an international body dedicated to the protection of satellite systems, and other Internet-powered space technologies, in outer space.",

In recent years, land-based cyber intrusions, hacks and data breaches, including ones against Equifax, Sony, the Democratic National Committee and the Office of Personnel Management, exposed masses of consumer data and compromised the networks of various private companies and governmental organizations. These significant events caused great harm to the organizations, the economy and the public. Cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for public and private organizations in recent years. However, the issue has not been meaningfully addressed among the international legal community, particularly within the space sector. If a hostile actor were to successfully infiltrate the networks of major satellite systems that orbit the Earth, which the world relies on for, among other things, communication, navigation, weather monitoring, national security and military operations, the consequences could be catastrophic.

The Note applies the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force, the law of State responsibility, sovereignty and other principles of international law to hypothesize how the current international regime could address such a scenario. It concludes with the suggestion that: 1) the international space law community adopt cooperative and streamlined norms, standards and initiatives that are adaptable to constantly evolving technologies, including the formation of an international body dedicated to cyber issues in outer space that would bring all relevant parties together; and 2) within that framework consider implementing amendments to the space law treaties as a long-term goal.\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nWhen a powerful Soviet satellite armed with electromagnetic pulse weaponry falls into the wrong hands, British intelligence agents had to risk their lives to prevent the space-based weapon from incapacitating electricity-powered technologies on Earth in a destructive blast.¹ While this is the somewhat far-fetched plot of the 1995 James Bond film *Goldeneye*, the film illustrates the importance of artificial space-based satellites and the potential disaster that could result if a hostile actor gained control of one. Although no satellite capable of such mass destruction orbits the Earth currently, various military and civilian observation, communication, weather and navigational satellites, if compromised, could have similarly drastic consequences, particularly as satellite technologies advance and hostile intruders become more sophisticated, especially by utilizing Internet-based attacks.²\nThe problem of an artificial satellite becoming compromised due to a cyber intrusion of its network is not completely theoretical. In 2007 and 2008, several United States (US) military satellites were hacked through a ground station in Norway—the Chinese\n¹ See GOLDENEYE (United Artists 1995).\n² See William Akoto, *What Happens When All the Tiny Satellites We’re Shooting Into Space Get Hacked?*, FAST COMPANY (Feb. 15, 2020), https://www.fastcompany.com/90464666/what-happens-when-all-the-tiny-satellites-were-shooting-into-space-get-hacked.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nmilitary is the prime suspect.³ A Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1 satellite, which are used for climate and terrain monitoring by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Geological Survey (USGS), each experienced several minutes of interference.⁴ Luckily, no commands were successfully sent to the satellite and no data was captured by the hackers.⁵ However, it is concerning that these adversary possibly State hackers managed to infiltrate a highly sensitive network and gain access to the satellites' controls.⁶ Attempts did not end there. Another hacking campaign, allegedly by the Chinese again, occurred in 2018 when hackers intruded into the networks of satellite operators of private defense contractors and telecommunications companies.⁷ Although the international space community is beginning to consider the consequences of a successful hacking campaign on space technologies,⁸ it is only a matter of time before a State, one of its agents, or even an unidentifiable non-State actor successfully infiltrates a crucial commercial or government-owned satellite system and damages, destroys, steals sensitive data or manipulates its transmission.\nSatellites today are capable of a variety of functionality and have highly advanced technological capability. Satellites are relay stations in space that receive voice, data, and video communications signals from multiple military, government, and commercial ground stations across Earth,⁹ and are thus vulnerable to internet-\n³ Jim Wolf, China Key Suspect in U.S. Satellite Hacks: Commission, REUTERS (Oct. 28, 2011), https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-satellite-idUSTRE79R4O320111028.\n⁴ Id.\n⁵ Id.\n⁶ See U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION, 2011 REPORT TO CONGRESS (2011).\n⁷ Reuters, China-Based Hacking Campaign Is Said to Have Breached Satellite, Defense Companies, CNBC (June 19, 2018), https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/china-based-hacking-breached-satellite-defense-companies-symantec.html.\n⁸ NASA's chief information security officer has stated that preventing hacking of its systems is a top priority for the agency.

They provide Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, which the world relies on for navigation, communication, banking, agriculture, travel and the Internet.¹² They also transmit broadcast and terrestrial signals for radio and television, which are the only sources of communication people have in parts of the world that lack wi-fi.¹³\nIf a State military had more hostile intentions, it could disrupt the entire weather monitoring ability of the US, among other consequences.¹⁴ Hacking a GPS satellite, for instance, could seriously compromise worldwide travel and communication. Of particular note, cyber-attacks became more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving networks more vulnerable due to the disrupted economy and rise of teleworking.¹⁵ For instance, China may have attempted to hack American vaccine data.¹⁶ Networks can be infiltrated more easily when employees work from home, often from their own personal devices.

Now more than ever is the time to start taking cybersecurity more seriously.\nA major breach of certain satellite networks by sophisticated actors could have drastic effects, depending on the intentions of the intruder. For instance, the US military uses the USA 224 satellite for detailed spying all around the Earth for military activities.¹⁷ If that satellite were compromised, hackers could acquire invaluable and classified US intelligence, threaten US military operations and perhaps even manipulate the satellite's transmission to complete military objectives adverse to the interests of the US. Similarly, a hacker could also disrupt a geostationary weather satellite, such as the GOES series,¹⁸ causing weather prediction to be disrupted, or one of the many commercial telecommunications satellites that power critical infrastructure. Other disruptions could affect air traffic controls, cable and network television broadcasts, cell-phone communications, military intelligence and environmental monitoring.¹⁹ Current space law would likely never allow the launching of a satellite like Goldeneye with nuclear capabilities specifically designed as an electromagnetic weapon.²⁰ But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today. It is crucial that the law can account for hackers' ability to use sophisticated and constantly advancing technologies to access\n¹⁷ Geoff Brumfiel, Amateurs Identify U.S. Spy Satellite Behind President Trump's Tweet, NPR (Sept. 2, 2019), https://www.npr.org/2019/09/02/756673481/amateurs-identify-u-s-spy-satellite-behind-president-trumps-tweet.\n¹⁸ See NOAA GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE SERVER (last visited on May 11, 2020), https://www.goes.noaa.gov/.\n¹⁹ What Are Satellites Used For?, UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS (Feb. 13, 2014), https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-are-satellites-used#:~:text=Satellites%20can%20detect%20underground%20water,erosion%20of%20topsoil%20from%20land.\n²⁰ The Outer Space Treaty, which will be discussed in more detail in later sections, prohibits any nuclear weapons from being placed in Earth's orbit, and, although it does not explicitly prohibit other non-nuclear weapons, a device capable of such destruction would violate the treaty's notional requirement that outer space be used for peaceful purposes.

This question is particularly difficult to answer since there is no clear international framework governing cybersecurity on its own let alone cybersecurity in space.²² Additionally, the distinctive physical nature of both cyberspace and outer space presents challenges as to how these laws apply.²³ Although the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in outer space,²⁴ other means of destroying or interfering with a satellite are not directly prohibited by any of the five main treaties governing outer space.²⁵ However, the major principles drawn from those\n²¹ See Brian Barrett, *How 4 Chinese Hackers Allegedly Took Down Equifax*, WIRED (Feb. 10, 2020), https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-hack-china/.\n²² Although many States have enacted their own domestic cybersecurity laws, there is not much governing such activities on the international plane.

It also provides procedures for settling claims for damages.

Despite the recognition of cybersecurity’s importance on outer space technologies by many in the international space community,²⁹ the current legal framework warrants improvement. A streamlined, cooperative legal approach at the international, domestic and market levels is still needed.³⁰\nPart II of this Note discusses the background and history of the space race alongside the emergence of the Internet and how space and nuclear-capable States have developed into major cybersecurity threats against one another. Part III outlines the current international space law and general international law, most relevant to the issue of cyber intrusions against satellites. Part IV addresses specifically how current law can prevent and mitigate the risk of cyber-security breaches of artificial satellites and discusses what international resources and remedies are available if such an event were to occur. It posits that the current international legal framework is insufficient and suggests possible reforms to the law and other cooperative actions that the international space law community should take, including the formation of new UN body\nThe Registration Convention builds upon the Outer Space Treaty, Rescue Agreement, and Liability Convention creates a mechanism to help States identify space objects by expanding the scope of the UN Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space and addressed issues relating to State parties’ responsibilities concerning space objects.

BACKGROUND\n## A. The Cold War’s Significance on the Space Race Alongside the Internet’s Development\nThe Cold War solidified the status of Russia, at that time the Soviet Union, and the US as the two primary players in both the space race and the nuclear arms race.³¹ Space was linked to nuclear disarmament during this period.³² After the 1967 launch of Sputnik, the world’s first artificial satellite, into orbit by the Soviet Union, the US and the Soviet Union competed in their space capabilities with various launches and experiments. The US capabilities demonstrably surpassed the Soviets with Apollo 8 orbiting the Moon and Apollo 11 putting humans on the Moon at the end of the decade.³³ In fact, the Moon landing may even have been a catalyst to the end of the Cold War and the cementing of the US’s advantage over the Soviets in the nuclear arms and space races.³⁴ Notably, the same technology used to launch Sputnik into space was intended by the Soviets as a way to deliver intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBMs).³⁵\nAt the same time, the Internet was developed largely as a reaction to the events of the Cold War.³⁶ The US military created\n³¹ See Bradley G.

For instance, Anonymous, the first major hacker group, committed various attacks against governmental organizations and corporations, mainly in the name of privacy.⁴¹ By the 2010s, the US began to identify even more sophisticated security breaches committed by State-sponsored intelligence operatives for the first time.⁴² Today, cybersecurity is a major concern for individuals, governments and corporations as organizations rely almost exclusively on Internet-capable technologies.

If State and non-State actors⁵⁷ are capable of such major hacks on Earth-based systems, there is little stopping them from targeting satellites in space via the Internet.\nCurrent space law does not allow the placement of nuclear weapons or a weapon of mass destruction such as Goldeneye into orbit.⁵⁸ But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today, so it is crucial that space law can account for the fact that evolving technologies create new ways for hackers to access these systems. Today, most devices, including satellites, rely on the Internet, and with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), that will only increase.\nHistory shows that satellites are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which scholar P. J. Blount argues are merely one form of IoT,⁵⁹ and given the rise of military activities in outer space⁶⁰ and military cyber espionage and attacks,⁶¹ there is no reason to doubt that a State or nonaligned hacker group may attempt to infiltrate and\nand stealing trade secrets and highly personal data from millions of Americans.

Although there is not conclusive proof, the indictment suggests the hack was part of a series of major data thefts organized by the People's Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence agencies.

The Chinese have already been suspected of successfully gained access to the Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1.⁶² The Pentagon has also reported that both the Chinese and Russians are developing lasers and a host of other anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, which could track, study, or even target adversary satellites through physical, kinetic, microwave and cyber technologies.⁶³ This Pentagon report also apparently indicated that the Chinese and Russians are preparing to employ offensive and defensive ASAT technology, which could extend to cyber infiltration of satellites as well.⁶⁴\nBlount argues that it is only a matter of time before military conflict occurs in outer space.⁶⁵ He notes that although China and the US have developed ASAT technologies, no legal instrument has been adopted to regulate them.⁶⁶ Blount goes on to suggest that the rules of armed conflict from international humanitarian law should extend to military activities in space.⁶⁷ Blount’s ideas serve as a useful starting point in examining what sorts of international rules could be adopted to effectively regulate and prevent cyber attacks against satellites.\n## II. CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REGIME\nBoth international law in general and international space law in particular provide legal protections to both States and private satellite operators to ensure the security of their satellites in space. Because there are only five treaties⁶⁸ governing space activities specifically, much of the law applicable to cybersecurity of satellites comes from general public international law, which the Outer Space Treaty says governs outer space activities as well.⁶⁹\n⁶² See Wolf, supra note 3.\n⁶³ These ASATs may employ microwave, radiofrequency jamming, laser, chemical spraying, kinetic kill and robotic technologies to attack satellites.

III.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 419\nAdditionally, the nature of cyberspace, because it is intangible, presents many challenges that traditional international law does not address. Due to its infancy, even more so than space exploration, there is no clear standard of international legal norms in the area of cybersecurity.⁷⁰ Rather, there are mostly theories and suggestions as to how the traditional rules and principles apply in this new domain.\nAccording to Article 38 of the Statute governing the International Court of Justice (ICJ), public international law consists of three primary sources: (1) international conventions, (2) international custom, as evidence of general practice accepted as law and (3) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.⁷¹ In addition, judicial decisions and the “teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations” may serve as subsidiary sources.⁷² Finally, there are various other sources of soft law, such as memoranda of understanding, recommendations, principles and resolutions, which lack the same enforcement measures of “hard law” but serve as useful persuasive authority.⁷³ These subsidiary sources are particularly useful in space law considering the field’s infancy, even more so compared to space law due to the recent advance of computer technology, and lack of internationally binding legal instruments.\n## A. Treaties\n### i. The Outer Space Treaty\nThe foundational international convention governing space activities is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.⁷⁴ According to the Treaty, all space activities should be carried out in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, in the interest of maintaining peace, security, cooperation and understanding, and States should act with “due regard” to the interests of all other parties to\n⁷⁰ See Duggal, supra note 22.\n⁷¹ Statute of the International Court of Justice Art. 38 June 26 1945, 6 L.N.T.S. 391-413.\n⁷² Id. at art. 38.4\n⁷³ See Francis Lyall &amp; Paul B. Larsen, Space Law: A Treatise 47-48 (Routledge ed., 2d ed. 2018).\n⁷⁴ Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20.\n420 JOURNAL OF SPACE LAW [VOL. 45.2\nthe treaty.⁷⁵ Thus, treaties, custom and other sources of general international law also govern outer space activities.\nAdditionally, the placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in space is prohibited.⁷⁶ However, nothing in the treaty addresses non-nuclear space weapons explicitly, though Article IV says that the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used only for peaceful purposes, but launching other types of weapons into space, depending on the purpose and capability of destruction, could go against the Treaty’s overall object and purpose of maintaining peace and security.⁷⁷ Nevertheless, the Treaty does not explicitly prohibit non-physical threats, such as cyber intrusions.\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides for some redress for violations of international law. States who conduct national activities in outer space bear “international responsibility” for such activities but are only “liable” for physical damage caused by space objects they launch into outer space whereas the Liability Convention expands in more detail on when a State actually must pay for damages.⁷⁸\n## ii. The Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention provides that States should pay for damage caused by objects the State launches into outer space.⁷⁹ Liability should be distinguished from “international responsibility.”⁸⁰ Specifically, it states that “[a] launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.”⁸¹ If damage is caused elsewhere, the launching State “shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.”⁸² But the Convention defines “damage” as death,\n---\n⁷⁵ *Id.* at arts.

VI, VII.\n⁷⁹ Liability Convention, *supra* note 25.\n⁸⁰ The Outer Space Treaty on its own does not say that a State deemed “internationally responsible” must pay compensatory damages to the injured State. See Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. VI.\n⁸¹ Liability Convention, *supra* note 25, art. II.\n⁸² *Id.* at art. III.\n2021]\nCOMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS\n421\nphysical injury or loss or damage to property; “launching state” as a State that launches or from whose territory a space object is launched; and a “space object” as components and parts of the space object itself and the launching vehicle.83 So, although a cyber-attack could cause physical as well as intangible damage to a satellite, under this treaty, it is unlikely that the drafters of this Convention anticipated non-physical threats by other actors in outer space, so hackers will likely not to be considered a State that launches an object into space.\niii. The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter, the foundational treaty of the United Nations (UN), governs outer space activities per Article III of the Outer Space Treaty.84 The Charter, among many other things, prohibits the use of force and requires States to resolve disputes by peaceful means unless the UN approves the use of force by resolution or the State uses force in self-defense.85 These principles raise the question of whether hacking, jamming or interfering with satellites through cyberspace constitutes a use of force because it is not necessarily an “armed” attack in the traditional sense.86\niv.

Interestingly, Professor Kress notes that the question of whether harmful cyber operations violate this prohibition is uncertain because while cyber operations can cause massive damage to critical national infrastructure, the harms would be mainly economic in nature.\n86 Id. at art. 2(4).\n87 Many recent state laws in the US provide stronger protection to individuals’ personally identifiable information (PII) and say what businesses can and cannot do with such information that they collect from consumers. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives more rights to consumers and control over their information. See Cal. Civ. Code 1.81 § 1798.100-1798.199 (West 2018). For an in-depth analysis on the CCPA, the nation’s first major comprehensive consumer privacy law, see\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nnation-States should handle cyber-security attacks.⁸⁸ The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is the first and only international convention that specifically seeks to address Internet crime.⁸⁹ The treaty attempts to harmonize the laws addressing copyright infringement, computer fraud, child pornography and violations of network security.⁹⁰ However, it only has sixty-seven signatories, and its scope is narrow.⁹¹ Despite the original intention that the Convention apply globally, the US only ratified it in 2006,⁹² while various States that hold strong nationalism and sovereignty views, such as Russia, unsurprisingly, oppose it.⁹³ It has garnered little recognition and significance since its adoption.\n## B.

Violating Another State’s Sovereignty\nStates can violate international law by interfering with another State’s sovereignty or territorial integrity.⁹⁹ Territorial sovereignty means that a State exercises complete and exclusive jurisdiction over its physical territory.¹⁰⁰ The ICJ has stressed that “respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.”¹⁰¹ Traditionally, whether a State violated another State’s sovereignty could easily be determined because it was dependent on physical borders.¹⁰² However, determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation can be difficult in the space and cyber context due to its cross-border nature and the fact that a hack might not actually occur in outer space but rather through servers on Earth.\n## iii.

While there is little authority on State attribution in the cyber context, the *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* serves as a useful reference guide on the current State of customary international law, particularly on this topic.¹⁰⁶\n## C. Subsidiary Sources and Soft Law\nIn addition to treaties and customary international law, subsidiary sources can be a useful, additional authority. These could include opinions from the ICJ on general subjects of international law. Given the novelty of cyberattacks on space assets, scholarly commentary are also useful sources, especially considering the lack of established binding legal authority in this area. Additionally, Unite Nations principles, declarations and resolutions serve as useful “soft law” that do not have the same binding effect as treaties and other primary sources of international law. They are indicative, however, of State practice and international consensus.\n---\n¹⁰³ See DRAFT ARTICLES ON RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS WITH COMMENTARY ARTS. 2, 4, 8, INT’L LAW COMM’N 2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf ([hereinafter DRAFT ARTICLES].\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.*\n¹⁰⁵ See *id.* § 905.\n¹⁰⁶ See generally TALLINN MANUAL 2.0 *supra* note 88.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 425\n## III. HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN PREVENT AND PROVIDE REDRESS FOR A MAJOR CYBER-ATTACK ON A SATELLITE SYSTEM\nA successful cyber-attack on a satellite could interfere with the space object’s flight control, payload control or transmission.¹⁰⁷ Because the Outer Space Treaty says that space activities are governed by international law,¹⁰⁸ if such an attack were to occur, the State or private company whose satellite was compromised would turn to international law to evaluate its response options and any potential recourse the attacker owes. The injured satellite operator will want assurances and effective enforcement measures from the law that discourage and disincentivize hostile actors from committing attacks.\n### A. Prevention and Risk Mitigation: How Hacking Satellites Violates International Law\nThe space law treaties say little specifically about how States can prevent against possible cyber military or terrorist attacks in space but are more concerned with the peaceful use and exploration of outer space for the “province of all [hu]mankind.”¹⁰⁹ However, there are various ways that general international law can be violated when a hacker invades a government or private satellite’s network.\nFirst, a cyber-attack, depending on its nature and scope, could qualify as a violation of international law because it is a prohibited “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.¹¹⁰ Second, a cyber-attack may constitute a violation of a State’s territorial\n---\n¹⁰⁷ See Elizabeth Howell, *What Is A Satellite?*, SPACE.COM (Oct. 27, 2017), https://www.space.com/24839-satellites.html.\n¹⁰⁸ Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. III.\n¹⁰⁹ *Id.* at art. I.\n¹¹⁰ See UN Charter art. 2(4). For instance, a hacker State could use prohibited force against another State directly by interfering with its weather or Internet communications, causing technology failures, transportation shutdowns, or emergency responses that would likely cause significant physical damage. This type of hack would more clearly qualify as a use of force because it resulted in physical damage, even if the hacker was not using armed force in the traditional sense. Alternatively, a more indirect use of force could be economic in nature, such as collapsing a State’s stock exchange system or financial institutions, which would be more difficult to show as a violation of the UN Charter.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsovereignty.¹¹¹ But whether a violation of international law actually occurs will be highly context specific.\ni. Cyber-Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite’s Network As a “Use of Force” Prohibited by the United Nations Charter\nWhether the UN’s prohibition against the use of force, and exception for self-defense measures, applies to cyberspace is generally unresolved by international law and highly dependent on each State’s particular interpretation of the Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter says that States may use force in self-defense or in anticipation of an impending attack “if an armed attack occurs.”¹¹² Although cyber activities are not “armed” in the traditional sense,¹¹³ a successful cyber operation against a satellite system could qualify as an armed attack under international law depending on the circumstances of the attack.¹¹⁴ The theory accepted by most States on Article 2(4)’s applicability in cyberspace argues that an attack may be deemed “armed” if its scope and effect are equivalent to that of a\n¹¹¹ A cyber-attack that crosses State borders, unlike traditional violations of territorial sovereignty, is more difficult to determine because of the intangible nature of cyberspace. If a hacker caused massive amounts of damage to another State across the globe, without ever actually setting foot in that State, it would be difficult to argue that the hacker violated traditional principles of sovereignty, which focuses on a State’s exclusive jurisdiction over physical territory. See supra note 100.\n¹¹² UN Charter arts. 2(4); see also art. 51 (permitting States to use force in self defense against an armed attack).\n¹¹³ See Benedikt Pirker, supra note 99.\n¹¹⁴ Id. Depending on the target, extent of damage, intentions of the attacker, and a variety of other factual circumstances, a cyber attack may or may not qualify as a “use of force” under the UN Charter. While hackers generally are not “armed” in the traditional sense of having physical weapons, they could cause massive damage to variety of information and communications systems through malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, zero-day exploits, or domain name system (DNS) tunnelling. See What is a Cyberattack? CISCO (last visited Sept. 6, 2022), https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html#-types-of-cyber-attacks.\nFor instance, a malware attack, commonly understood as a cyber-attack using malicious software to breach a network vulnerability and block access, install harmful software, steal data, or render the system inoperable, that shut down aviation systems could qualify as a prohibited use of force because it would cause massive damage to a State’s transportation infrastructure and was clearly intended to disrupt those communication systems. See id. By contrast, a man-in-the middle attack that merely eavesdrops and obtains information from an important government transaction may be damaging and potentially illegal, but would be less likely to qualify as a use of force under the UN Charter. See id.; UN Charter art. 2(4).\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 427\nphysical attack.¹¹⁵ Other theories take a more holistic view and consider various factors such as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legality.¹¹⁶ This section focuses on the “effects” test, as it is the test followed by most States and the US.¹¹⁷\nUnder the “effects” test, a hacker that intentionally causes physical damage to a satellite will have violated the UN’s prohibition on force and thus committed an internationally wrongful act.¹¹⁸ The US in particular considers “clandestine” military operations conducted in cyberspace to be traditional military activity.¹¹⁹ For instance, if Chinese military operatives were to intentionally invade a US military satellite network to destroy it or cause it to collide into another satellite in space, this conduct would violate the UN Charter’s prohibition under the US interpretation because the operatives have caused clear tangible damage to US military assets.\nHowever, if the cyber intrusion causes more of an economic or dignitary harm, such as information theft, that does not have a direct physical effect, delineating between permissible and prohibited acts under international law becomes less clear. The ICJ has ruled on drawing this line in *Nicaragua v. United States* when it found that the US merely funding Nicaraguan guerillas who opposed their government did not use prohibited force against the State.¹²⁰ The US did use force, however, when it armed and trained those forces, even without any immediate physical effects.¹²¹ This case suggests that some additional, and intentional, steps must be taken by hackers beyond mere access for an intrusion to constitute a prohibited use of force under the effects test. So, if Chinese military operatives only gained access to a satellite communications system merely to infiltrate the system, as they allegedly did in 2007 and\n¹¹⁵ This theory is referred to as the “effects” test.

Cyber Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite's Network as a Violation of a State's Territorial Sovereignty\nA State can also violate international law with a cyber intrusion if it interferes with another State's sovereignty or territorial integrity.¹²⁴ Like with the UN prohibition against the use of force, drawing the line between legal conduct and an illegal violation of State sovereignty can be murky.¹²⁵ In the Corfu Channel Case, for instance, the ICJ found that the United Kingdom (UK) did not violate Albania's sovereignty when its warships passed through Albanian waters during World War II without permission from the government but did when it went back into the waters to conduct minesweeping operations later on.¹²⁶ While some amount of coercion will not amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty, when an interference crosses the line to become a prohibited intervention, this will violate international law.¹²⁷ In the cyber context, a minor interference, such as the alleged Chinese interference in 2007 and 2008,¹²⁸ that causes little or no disturbance or damage, would likely not qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty because it is more akin to \"passing through.\"¹²⁹ But, at certain point, a cyber interference could become a sovereignty violation when it rises to the level of the minesweeping activity in the Corfu Channel Case.¹³⁰ Following the reasoning of this case, a State who infiltrates a satellite system merely to \"pass through\" would likely not violate international law. But taking data, damaging the satellite, or manipulating its transmission would be more akin to \"minesweeping\" and thus a\n¹²² See Wolf, supra note 3.\n¹²³ Id.\n¹²⁴ See Pirker, supra note 99, at 192.\n¹²⁵ Id.\n¹²⁶ U.K. v.

Unlike a channel of water that clearly sits within a State’s physical borders, cyberspace, like outer space, has been argued to be a “global commons.”¹³⁴ A global commons is an area located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any particular State to which all nations have access.¹³⁵ The Outer Space Treaty suggests that outer space is a global commons when it calls it the province of all of humankind.¹³⁶ However, cyberspace, unlike outer space, more suitably falls under the sovereign jurisdiction of individual States. For one, cyberspace is run by physical servers and modems, and when a virus is transmitted to a network, it can be traced to a physical source.¹³⁷ Additionally, States can prevent others from accessing their content outside of the country because they have their own Internet regulators, filters and IP addresses. By contrast, outer space still exists within physical space and is not subject to the same constraints and regulation as the Internet. But any State is free to explore outer space without permission from another State.¹³⁸ It has no physical territory of origin because it exists all\n¹³¹ Id.\n¹³² Id.\n¹³³ U.K v.Alb., 1949 I.C.J. at 35-36.\n¹³⁴ See Pirker, supra note 99, at 195.\n¹³⁵ See OFF.

Hackers will generally invade the physical server located on Earth that will then send signals and commands to the space-based object. So, even if satellites were not subject to national appropriation once launched into outer space, most hacking occurs on the Earth. Additionally, even if a hacker attacked a satellite in space directly, such as through an ASAT weapon,¹⁴⁰ the satellite is the property of the State or private company. While space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation,¹⁴¹ property launched into space is.¹⁴² Thus, a major cyber-attack against a State or privately-owned satellite would likely be deemed a violation of State sovereignty, presuming it qualifies as more than just \"passing through.\"¹⁴³\n## B. State Response and Redress\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides that States should bear international responsibility, distinguished from liability, for national activities in outer space.¹⁴⁴ The law of State responsibility governs how States may respond to acts of aggression under international law.¹⁴⁵ However, there are often rogue hackers whose actions cannot be attributable to a State government. Likewise, the Liability Convention expands on the Outer Space Treaty, providing a special framework for State liability for damage that a State causes object.¹⁴⁶ Because this Convention was adopted before the existence of the Internet and when only a few States conducted activities in\n¹³⁹ Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

Determining International Responsibility and Response Options\nIf a State violates international law, either directly or through its organs or agents,¹⁴⁸ it generally must make reparation through restitution for the loss or injury and may be responded against by the injured State.¹⁴⁹ Even if the source of a virus or malware can be traced to the territory of a particular State, the hack could have been orchestrated by a rogue actor unassociated with the government. If so, public international law provides little recourse, and the affected party must seek alternative relief. Often, a State is only suspected of sponsoring a cyberattack or is not even involved at all. For instance, in the OPM hack, the US government traced the source of the data breach to Chinese nationals but could not formally link them to the government, at least at first.¹⁵⁰ In this particular case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later charged four members of the Chinese military with the hack and explicitly tied the attack to Beijing.¹⁵¹ This case is an outlier because the US was very close to eventually being able to attribute the hackers to the Chinese government, though could not do so definitively, but in many cases, attribution to the State or even\n¹⁴⁷ See Stefan A. Kaiser &amp; Martha Mejía-Kaiser, Cyber Security in Air and Space Law, 64 Z.L.W. 396, 406-07 (2015).\n¹⁴⁸ A State may still be internationally responsible if it does not act directly but directs or controls other actors. See DRAFT ARTICLES, supra note 103, arts. 2, 4, 8.\n¹⁴⁹ See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS §§ 901, 905.\n¹⁵⁰ “While no ‘smoking gun’ was found linking the attack to a specific perpetrator, the overwhelming consensus is that OPM was hacked by State-sponsored attackers working for the Chinese government. See Josh Fruhlinger, The OPM Hack Explained: Bad Security Practices Meet China’s Captain America, CSO (Feb. 12, 2020), https://www.csoonline.com/article/3318238/the-opm-hack-explained-bad-security-practices-meet-chinas-captain-america.html.\n¹⁵¹ But the US rarely files criminal charges against foreign intelligence officers for fear of retaliation. Id.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsuspected attribution cannot be determined at all because the hackers cannot be found or have no provable links to the government.¹⁵²\nAttributing a cyberattack to a State can be a difficult process. First, identifying hackers can be technically challenging because they use third-party proxies and other concealment tools to mask their activities.¹⁵³ Additionally, international law lacks streamlined norms regarding cyberactivity, which makes formal attribution impractical.¹⁵⁴ According to Tallinn 2.0, “[c]yber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.”¹⁵⁵ In addition, a State is responsible for intentionally aiding or assisting, directing or controlling, or coercing another State to violate international law.¹⁵⁶ But this has proved difficult to show. For instance, officials suspected that those responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016 were linked to the Russian government, but it was not until the end of the year, after the election of President Trump, that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency formally declared that the Russian government interfered with the election, after almost a year of research, intelligence gathering and reporting.¹⁵⁷ Presumably, hackers who could infiltrate a highly secure satellite network will have to be pretty sophisticated, making it easier to hide their tracks. Thus, the rise of unidentifiable hackers or those with weak ties to State governments makes attribution less likely.\nAssuming that a cyberattack can be attributed to a State, and that that attack was a violation of international law, the Outer Space Treaty provides guidance as to what recourse and remedies are available to States after an attack has occurred.¹⁵⁸ In certain\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ See William Banks, State Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0, 95 TEX.

State Liability for Damage Caused by a Cyber Attack\nA cyberattack could compromise a satellite by causing clear physical damage or indirect damage to the satellite operator’s economic, informational, or intellectual property assets. It is much easier for a State to recover for physical damage because it can simply sue for damage to property.¹⁶³ The Liability Convention, however, only provides recourse for damage caused by space objects by the “launching State.”¹⁶⁴ A State whose agents attack another State’s satellite networks via the Internet is not necessarily launching a space object as the Convention requires.¹⁶⁵ The Convention provides liability in a narrow set of circumstances.¹⁶⁶ An intrusion may be just as damaging but only cause intellectual property or economic damage, such as when the hacker takes military intelligence stored in the satellite’s network or disrupts satellite navigational or communication signals, without directly causing any physical damage.

Interpreting the Convention's language as applying to more intangible aggression in space goes directly against the treaty's plain text. Thus, the Liability Convention would not provide a remedy unless interpreted very broadly since any State or non-State actor that hacks a satellite network will almost certainly not be physically launching an object into space. However, the State could still take the responsible party to the ICJ or domestic courts because domestic law is really where most of the regulation on data security and violations of intellectual property exist, subject to the sovereign immunity exceptions, and could succeed in such a claim depending on the nature of the attack and amount of damage caused.\n## IV. SUGGESTIONS FOR REFORM\n## A. Adopting New Treaties or Amending the Current Rules\nIn theory, States could convene to create a new treaty or, at the very least, amend the current treaties to create broader language that is more suitable to addressing intangible cyber threats to satellite systems. For instance, the Liability Convention's requirement of a \"launching State\" does not account for anything other than physical damage caused by another State's launch.[167] However, this seemingly most obvious solution is probably the most unrealistic. First, completing this goal would be a long, arduous process with every State having different interests. Even if it succeeded, by the time a new treaty was adopted, the technology will no doubt out pace any agreement.[168] Additionally, there have been attempts to adopt new space-related treaties that have failed.[169] Amended treaties and additional international legal instruments that provide stronger cybersecurity protections may work temporarily but not long-term and would be met with much resistance.\n167 See Liability Convention, supra note 79, arts. I, II.\n168 See generally Blount, supra note 65.\n169 See e.g., Jeff Foust, U.S. Dismisses Space Weapons Treaty Proposal As \"Fundamentally Flawed\", SPACE NEWS (Sept. 11, 2014), https://spacenews.com/41842us-dismisses-space-weapons-treaty-proposal-as-fundamentally-flawed/.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 435\n## B. International Cooperation and Implementing More Adaptive Standards\nBecause of the inherently global nature of both cyberspace and satellites, international cooperation among States is crucial to set a baseline of international legal norms that protect satellites and satellite communications from cyber interferences. According to Blount, the primary sources that govern space law lack sufficient enforcement mechanisms.¹⁷⁰ Cybersecurity laws are a scattered and inconsistent collection of domestic laws and international norms that States have been slow to adopt.¹⁷¹ Implementing specific cybersecurity laws at the international level, particularly ones directly aimed at or capable of protecting space assets, could create a false sense of security for a time, until technology changes again, and complying with the law no longer mitigates risk.¹⁷² Although satellite operators will feel pressure to establish cybersecurity practices and standards within international space law, to maximize the Internet security of these satellites, cooperative efforts among States is necessary to protect the networks and avoid potential conflict in outer space.¹⁷³\nPerhaps there is a way to follow Blount’s approach of focusing on international cooperation and implementing adaptable standards in addition to adopting some rigid international legal instruments, or amendments to the current ones, as a long-term goal. The combination of hard legal rules with malleable standards and international cooperation could account both for the need for stricter enforcement and clearer legal rules and address Blount’s concern that technology will outpace the law. If adopting or amending a treaty is currently infeasible, perhaps the UN could impose declarations, principles, or even resolutions that reinterpret the UN Charter’s provisions to account for these new threats that the original drafters did not anticipate. Adopting an international body dedicated to cybersecurity in outer space, similar to COPUOS, could also be a potential solution, simply to bring all the relevant parties to the table to address this vexing problem.\n---\n¹⁷⁰ Blount, *supra* note 65, at 273.\n¹⁷¹ *Id.* at 293.\n¹⁷² *Id.*\n¹⁷³ *Id.*\n436 JOURNAL OF SPACE LAW [VOL. 45.2\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe convergence of cyberspace and outer space presents novel questions within space law and international law in general. Both space law and cybersecurity law are new areas, and cybersecurity law has continued to evolve and change with technology while space law has remained relatively stagnant. The novelty of these areas of the law, along with the unique physical nature of space and the intangibility of cyberspace, makes it difficult to determine what sorts of cyber intrusions to space satellite systems violate international law. While there is no clear answer as to how exactly the international legal community should deal with this problem, plenty of authority stemming from traditional international law can be utilized. Additionally, States have several options moving forward to ensure the protection of these highly sensitive space-based systems and provide relief to victims of hacks. Although adopting new international legal instruments, or modifying the current ones, would be the ideal solution, it would be unlikely to garner much support considering the various interests of the various nations. Perhaps this can remain a long-term goal, but in the meantime, States should work cooperatively, with strong support from the private sector, to adopt international legal norms and practices in the form of declarations, principles, resolutions, State practice, and perhaps even the creation of an international body dedicated to the protection of satellite systems, and other Internet-powered space technologies, in outer space.",

In recent years, land-based cyber intrusions, hacks and data breaches, including ones against Equifax, Sony, the Democratic National Committee and the Office of Personnel Management, exposed masses of consumer data and compromised the networks of various private companies and governmental organizations. These significant events caused great harm to the organizations, the economy and the public. Cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for public and private organizations in recent years. However, the issue has not been meaningfully addressed among the international legal community, particularly within the space sector. If a hostile actor were to successfully infiltrate the networks of major satellite systems that orbit the Earth, which the world relies on for, among other things, communication, navigation, weather monitoring, national security and military operations, the consequences could be catastrophic. This Note addresses what sorts of cyber-attacks or intrusions to a satellite system would constitute a violation of international law and to what degree a State can respond and receive reparation for damage, either physical or otherwise, caused.

The Note applies the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force, the law of State responsibility, sovereignty and other principles of international law to hypothesize how the current international regime could address such a scenario. It concludes with the suggestion that: 1) the international space law community adopt cooperative and streamlined norms, standards and initiatives that are adaptable to constantly evolving technologies, including the formation of an international body dedicated to cyber issues in outer space that would bring all relevant parties together; and 2) within that framework consider implementing amendments to the space law treaties as a long-term goal.\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nWhen a powerful Soviet satellite armed with electromagnetic pulse weaponry falls into the wrong hands, British intelligence agents had to risk their lives to prevent the space-based weapon from incapacitating electricity-powered technologies on Earth in a destructive blast. While this is the somewhat far-fetched plot of the 1995 James Bond film *Goldeneye*, the film illustrates the importance of artificial space-based satellites and the potential disaster that could result if a hostile actor gained control of one. Although no satellite capable of such mass destruction orbits the Earth currently, various military and civilian observation, communication, weather and navigational satellites, if compromised, could have similarly drastic consequences, particularly as satellite technologies advance and hostile intruders become more sophisticated, especially by utilizing Internet-based attacks.\nThe problem of an artificial satellite becoming compromised due to a cyber intrusion of its network is not completely theoretical. In 2007 and 2008, several United States (US) military satellites were hacked through a ground station in Norway—the Chinese\n See GOLDENEYE (United Artists 1995).\n See William Akoto, *What Happens When All the Tiny Satellites We’re Shooting Into Space Get Hacked?*, FAST COMPANY (Feb. 15, 2020), https://www.fastcompany.com/90464666/what-happens-when-all-the-tiny-satellites-were-shooting-into-space-get-hacked.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nmilitary is the prime suspect. A Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1 satellite, which are used for climate and terrain monitoring by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Geological Survey (USGS), each experienced several minutes of interference. Luckily, no commands were successfully sent to the satellite and no data was captured by the hackers. However, it is concerning that these adversary possibly State hackers managed to infiltrate a highly sensitive network and gain access to the satellites' controls. Attempts did not end there. Another hacking campaign, allegedly by the Chinese again, occurred in 2018 when hackers intruded into the networks of satellite operators of private defense contractors and telecommunications companies. Although the international space community is beginning to consider the consequences of a successful hacking campaign on space technologies, it is only a matter of time before a State, one of its agents, or even an unidentifiable non-State actor successfully infiltrates a crucial commercial or government-owned satellite system and damages, destroys, steals sensitive data or manipulates its transmission.\nSatellites today are capable of a variety of functionality and have highly advanced technological capability. Satellites are relay stations in space that receive voice, data, and video communications signals from multiple military, government, and commercial ground stations across Earth, and are thus vulnerable to internet-\n Jim Wolf, China Key Suspect in U.S. Satellite Hacks: Commission, REUTERS (Oct. 28, 2011), https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-satellite-idUSTRE79R4O320111028.\n Id.\n Id.\n See U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION, 2011 REPORT TO CONGRESS (2011).\n Reuters, China-Based Hacking Campaign Is Said to Have Breached Satellite, Defense Companies, CNBC (June 19, 2018), https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/china-based-hacking-breached-satellite-defense-companies-symantec.html.\n NASA's chief information security officer has stated that preventing hacking of its systems is a top priority for the agency.

Hacking a GPS satellite, for instance, could seriously compromise worldwide travel and communication. Of particular note, cyber-attacks became more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving networks more vulnerable due to the disrupted economy and rise of teleworking.

Now more than ever is the time to start taking cybersecurity more seriously.\nA major breach of certain satellite networks by sophisticated actors could have drastic effects, depending on the intentions of the intruder. For instance, the US military uses the USA 224 satellite for detailed spying all around the Earth for military activities. If that satellite were compromised, hackers could acquire invaluable and classified US intelligence, threaten US military operations and perhaps even manipulate the satellite's transmission to complete military objectives adverse to the interests of the US. Similarly, a hacker could also disrupt a geostationary weather satellite, such as the GOES series, causing weather prediction to be disrupted, or one of the many commercial telecommunications satellites that power critical infrastructure. Other disruptions could affect air traffic controls, cable and network television broadcasts, cell-phone communications, military intelligence and environmental monitoring. Current space law would likely never allow the launching of a satellite like Goldeneye with nuclear capabilities specifically designed as an electromagnetic weapon. But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today.

In particular, it is unclear exactly how current international law, which is still evolving in both the cyber and space realms, could disincentivize hackers and provide States with sufficient response options or remedies. This question is particularly difficult to answer since there is no clear international framework governing cybersecurity on its own let alone cybersecurity in space. Additionally, the distinctive physical nature of both cyberspace and outer space presents challenges as to how these laws apply. Although the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in outer space, other means of destroying or interfering with a satellite are not directly prohibited by any of the five main treaties governing outer space. However, the major principles drawn from those\n See Brian Barrett, *How 4 Chinese Hackers Allegedly Took Down Equifax*, WIRED (Feb. 10, 2020), https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-hack-china/.\n Although many States have enacted their own domestic cybersecurity laws, there is not much governing such activities on the international plane. See Pavan Duggal, Chairman, Int’l Comm’n on Cyber Security Law, *UNOOSA Presentation: Cyber Security Law, It’s Regulation and Relevance for Outer Space*, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/hf/HLF2017/presentations/Day2/Session_7b/Presentation5.pdf.\n See generally, *ACQNOTES*, https://acqnotes.com/acqnote/careerfields/cyberspace (last visited Jan. 3, 2022).\n Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. IV.\n See Stephens &amp; Blake, *supra* note 12. In addition to the Outer Space Treaty mentioned previously, there are four other relevant treaties for a total of five space law treaties. The Rescue Agreement elaborates on elements of articles V and VIII of the Outer Space Treaty, providing that States take all possible steps to rescue and assist astronauts in distress and promptly return them to the launching State and that States, upon request, assist launching states in recovering space objects outside the launching State’s territory. Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space, Apr. 22, 1968, 19 U.S.T. 7570.\nThe Liability Convention elaborates on article VII of the Outer Space Treaty, providing that a launching State should be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space objects on the surface of Earth or to aircraft and due to activities in space. It also provides procedures for settling claims for damages. Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Mar. 29, 1972, 24 U.S.T. 2389 [hereinafter Liability Convention].\n\ntreaties, along with other areas of international law, such as the law of State responsibility, the United Nations (UN) prohibition against the use of force and principles of sovereignty, may offer some guidance. Despite the recognition of cybersecurity’s importance on outer space technologies by many in the international space community, the current legal framework warrants improvement. A streamlined, cooperative legal approach at the international, domestic and market levels is still needed.\nPart II of this Note discusses the background and history of the space race alongside the emergence of the Internet and how space and nuclear-capable States have developed into major cybersecurity threats against one another. Part III outlines the current international space law and general international law, most relevant to the issue of cyber intrusions against satellites. Part IV addresses specifically how current law can prevent and mitigate the risk of cyber-security breaches of artificial satellites and discusses what international resources and remedies are available if such an event were to occur. It posits that the current international legal framework is insufficient and suggests possible reforms to the law and other cooperative actions that the international space law community should take, including the formation of new UN body\nThe Registration Convention builds upon the Outer Space Treaty, Rescue Agreement, and Liability Convention creates a mechanism to help States identify space objects by expanding the scope of the UN Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space and addressed issues relating to State parties’ responsibilities concerning space objects. Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, Jan. 14, 1975, 28 U.S.T. 695.\nThe Moon Agreement reaffirms and elaborates on many elements of the Outer Space Treaty as applied to the moon and other celestial bodies, providing that those bodies should be used only for peaceful purposes, their environments not disrupted, that the UN should be informed of the location and purpose of any station on those bodies. Additionally, and that the Moon and its natural resources are the common heritage of mankind and that an international regime should be established to govern the exploitation of such resources if exploitation becomes feasible.

BACKGROUND\n## A. The Cold War’s Significance on the Space Race Alongside the Internet’s Development\nThe Cold War solidified the status of Russia, at that time the Soviet Union, and the US as the two primary players in both the space race and the nuclear arms race. Space was linked to nuclear disarmament during this period. After the 1967 launch of Sputnik, the world’s first artificial satellite, into orbit by the Soviet Union, the US and the Soviet Union competed in their space capabilities with various launches and experiments. The US capabilities demonstrably surpassed the Soviets with Apollo 8 orbiting the Moon and Apollo 11 putting humans on the Moon at the end of the decade. In fact, the Moon landing may even have been a catalyst to the end of the Cold War and the cementing of the US’s advantage over the Soviets in the nuclear arms and space races. Notably, the same technology used to launch Sputnik into space was intended by the Soviets as a way to deliver intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBMs).\nAt the same time, the Internet was developed largely as a reaction to the events of the Cold War. The US military created\n See Bradley G. Shreve, *The US, the USSR, and Space Exploration, 1957-1963*, 20 INT’L J.

During the height of the Cold War, the US military further developed this network to communicate faster in the event of a nuclear attack. Eventually, this technology evolved into the Internet the world knows today.\nBefore long, the Internet was subject to various vulnerabilities in its network. The first computer virus was discovered in 1971 during the ARPANET age. By 1983, the US filed its first patent for cybersecurity protection to prevent these intrusions. Beginning in the early 2000s, State and non-State hackers became more organized and sophisticated. For instance, Anonymous, the first major hacker group, committed various attacks against governmental organizations and corporations, mainly in the name of privacy. By the 2010s, the US began to identify even more sophisticated security breaches committed by State-sponsored intelligence operatives for the first time. Today, cybersecurity is a major concern for individuals, governments and corporations as organizations rely almost exclusively on Internet-capable technologies. Most organizations today have information technology departments, a chief information officer (CIO), specific policies and technical measures to prevent and respond to cyber incidents or attacks and even a team of employees dedicated to cybersecurity prevention and response.\n Ben Tarnoff, *How the Internet Was Invented*, THE GUARDIAN (July 15, 2016), https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf.\n Spencer Bruttig &amp; Matt Gregory, *Here’s How the Cold War Helped Create the Internet We Know and Love Today*, WUSA9 (Dec. 6, 2019), https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/this-week-in-history-how-the-internet-was-created-during-the-cold-war/507-41b19bed-f500-4d66-a565-c72de578a7d0.\n Tim Matthew, *A Brief History of Cybersecurity*, CYBERSECURITY INSIDERS (last visited March 2, 2020), https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/a-brief-history-of-cybersecurity/.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.

In the US, for instance, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the main entity in charge of ensuring that government agencies have adequate standards and security policies in place and follow the government-sponsored guidance while the National Security Agency (NSA) has developed its own cyber-attack methods for responding to and hacking into the networks of adversary States. Certain States are notorious for cyber-attacks, whether government-sponsored or not, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Israel, the United Kingdom and even the United States. China, in particular, is responsible for 29.56% of denial of service attacks.\n## B.

Even North Korea placed a satellite into orbit in 2012. In addition, various private companies have placed satellites into orbit as well. SpaceX, for instance, plans to launch 12,000 small satellites into space to as part of the Starlink Internet project. Today there are more than 2,000 satellites in orbit, a number which will only increase in the future. All of them serve as potential targets for cyberattack by State militaries or other hacker groups.\nStates known to have developed cyber capabilities that have attacked the US in the past, such as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, or sophisticated non-State cyber hackers, pose significant threats to these space assets.

But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today, so it is crucial that space law can account for the fact that evolving technologies create new ways for hackers to access these systems. Today, most devices, including satellites, rely on the Internet, and with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), that will only increase.\nHistory shows that satellites are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which scholar P. J. Blount argues are merely one form of IoT, and given the rise of military activities in outer space and military cyber espionage and attacks, there is no reason to doubt that a State or nonaligned hacker group may attempt to infiltrate and\nand stealing trade secrets and highly personal data from millions of Americans.

Although there is not conclusive proof, the indictment suggests the hack was part of a series of major data thefts organized by the People's Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence agencies. See id.\nAnother such major data theft suspected to have been organized by China was the 2015 data breach against OPM, which resulted in the arrest of a Chinese national by the FBI in 2017.

The Chinese have already been suspected of successfully gained access to the Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1. The Pentagon has also reported that both the Chinese and Russians are developing lasers and a host of other anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, which could track, study, or even target adversary satellites through physical, kinetic, microwave and cyber technologies. This Pentagon report also apparently indicated that the Chinese and Russians are preparing to employ offensive and defensive ASAT technology, which could extend to cyber infiltration of satellites as well.\nBlount argues that it is only a matter of time before military conflict occurs in outer space. He notes that although China and the US have developed ASAT technologies, no legal instrument has been adopted to regulate them. Blount goes on to suggest that the rules of armed conflict from international humanitarian law should extend to military activities in space. Blount’s ideas serve as a useful starting point in examining what sorts of international rules could be adopted to effectively regulate and prevent cyber attacks against satellites.\n## II. CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REGIME\nBoth international law in general and international space law in particular provide legal protections to both States and private satellite operators to ensure the security of their satellites in space. Because there are only five treaties governing space activities specifically, much of the law applicable to cybersecurity of satellites comes from general public international law, which the Outer Space Treaty says governs outer space activities as well.\n See Wolf, supra note 3.\n These ASATs may employ microwave, radiofrequency jamming, laser, chemical spraying, kinetic kill and robotic technologies to attack satellites. See Patrick Tucker, China, Russia Building Attack Satellites and Space Lasers: Pentagon Report, DEFENSE ONE (Feb. 12, 2019), https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/02/china-russia-building-attack-satellites-and-space-lasers-pentagon-report/154819/.\n See id.\n P.J.

III.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 419\nAdditionally, the nature of cyberspace, because it is intangible, presents many challenges that traditional international law does not address. Due to its infancy, even more so than space exploration, there is no clear standard of international legal norms in the area of cybersecurity. Rather, there are mostly theories and suggestions as to how the traditional rules and principles apply in this new domain.\nAccording to Article 38 of the Statute governing the International Court of Justice (ICJ), public international law consists of three primary sources: (1) international conventions, (2) international custom, as evidence of general practice accepted as law and (3) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations. In addition, judicial decisions and the “teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations” may serve as subsidiary sources. Finally, there are various other sources of soft law, such as memoranda of understanding, recommendations, principles and resolutions, which lack the same enforcement measures of “hard law” but serve as useful persuasive authority. These subsidiary sources are particularly useful in space law considering the field’s infancy, even more so compared to space law due to the recent advance of computer technology, and lack of internationally binding legal instruments.\n## A. Treaties\n### i. The Outer Space Treaty\nThe foundational international convention governing space activities is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. According to the Treaty, all space activities should be carried out in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, in the interest of maintaining peace, security, cooperation and understanding, and States should act with “due regard” to the interests of all other parties to\n See Duggal, supra note 22.\n Statute of the International Court of Justice Art. 38 June 26 1945, 6 L.N.T.S. 391-413.\n Id. at art. 38.4\n See Francis Lyall &amp; Paul B. Larsen, Space Law: A Treatise 47-48 (Routledge ed., 2d ed. 2018).\n Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20.\n\nthe treaty. Thus, treaties, custom and other sources of general international law also govern outer space activities.\nAdditionally, the placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in space is prohibited. However, nothing in the treaty addresses non-nuclear space weapons explicitly, though Article IV says that the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used only for peaceful purposes, but launching other types of weapons into space, depending on the purpose and capability of destruction, could go against the Treaty’s overall object and purpose of maintaining peace and security. Nevertheless, the Treaty does not explicitly prohibit non-physical threats, such as cyber intrusions.\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides for some redress for violations of international law. States who conduct national activities in outer space bear “international responsibility” for such activities but are only “liable” for physical damage caused by space objects they launch into outer space whereas the Liability Convention expands in more detail on when a State actually must pay for damages.\n## ii. The Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention provides that States should pay for damage caused by objects the State launches into outer space. Liability should be distinguished from “international responsibility.” Specifically, it states that “[a] launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.” If damage is caused elsewhere, the launching State “shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” But the Convention defines “damage” as death,\n---\n *Id.* at arts.

The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter, the foundational treaty of the United Nations (UN), governs outer space activities per Article III of the Outer Space Treaty.84 The Charter, among many other things, prohibits the use of force and requires States to resolve disputes by peaceful means unless the UN approves the use of force by resolution or the State uses force in self-defense.85 These principles raise the question of whether hacking, jamming or interfering with satellites through cyberspace constitutes a use of force because it is not necessarily an “armed” attack in the traditional sense.86\niv. Budapest Convention on Cybercrime\nAlthough many US states have domestic privacy and data security laws,87 there is no real international standard regarding how\n\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nnation-States should handle cyber-security attacks. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is the first and only international convention that specifically seeks to address Internet crime. The treaty attempts to harmonize the laws addressing copyright infringement, computer fraud, child pornography and violations of network security. However, it only has sixty-seven signatories, and its scope is narrow. Despite the original intention that the Convention apply globally, the US only ratified it in 2006, while various States that hold strong nationalism and sovereignty views, such as Russia, unsurprisingly, oppose it. It has garnered little recognition and significance since its adoption.\n## B. Custom\n## i.

State practice on this principle can be seen in various treaties, statements, principles and policies from space-capable nations. There is even a body in the UN dedicated to maintaining peace, security and development in outer space—the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPOUS)—as well as a legal subcommittee. However, defining what “peaceful purposes” actually means can be difficult, especially when considering the intangible nature of cyberspace.\n## ii. Violating Another State’s Sovereignty\nStates can violate international law by interfering with another State’s sovereignty or territorial integrity. Territorial sovereignty means that a State exercises complete and exclusive jurisdiction over its physical territory. The ICJ has stressed that “respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.” Traditionally, whether a State violated another State’s sovereignty could easily be determined because it was dependent on physical borders. However, determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation can be difficult in the space and cyber context due to its cross-border nature and the fact that a hack might not actually occur in outer space but rather through servers on Earth.\n## iii. The Law of State Responsibility and Attribution\nThe law of State responsibility imposes several international rights and duties on States in the event of a violation of\n See Blount, supra note 59, at 2.\n Id.\n See Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, U.N.

States who commit an internationally wrongful act, either through a State organ or by an entity under the instruction or control of the State, owe reparations to the injured party. An injured State may also respond with countermeasures that are proportional to the original violation and are necessary to stop, prevent, or remedy the violation, subject to the limitations of the UN Charter. However, the perpetrators of many cyber-attacks cannot even be identified, let alone officially attributed to a State, and thus a State cannot be held internationally responsible. While there is little authority on State attribution in the cyber context, the *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* serves as a useful reference guide on the current State of customary international law, particularly on this topic.\n## C. Subsidiary Sources and Soft Law\nIn addition to treaties and customary international law, subsidiary sources can be a useful, additional authority. These could include opinions from the ICJ on general subjects of international law. Given the novelty of cyberattacks on space assets, scholarly commentary are also useful sources, especially considering the lack of established binding legal authority in this area. Additionally, Unite Nations principles, declarations and resolutions serve as useful “soft law” that do not have the same binding effect as treaties and other primary sources of international law. They are indicative, however, of State practice and international consensus.\n---\n See DRAFT ARTICLES ON RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS WITH COMMENTARY ARTS. 2, 4, 8, INT’L LAW COMM’N 2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf ([hereinafter DRAFT ARTICLES].\n *Id.*\n See *id.* § 905.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL 2.0 *supra* note 88.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 425\n## III. HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN PREVENT AND PROVIDE REDRESS FOR A MAJOR CYBER-ATTACK ON A SATELLITE SYSTEM\nA successful cyber-attack on a satellite could interfere with the space object’s flight control, payload control or transmission. Because the Outer Space Treaty says that space activities are governed by international law, if such an attack were to occur, the State or private company whose satellite was compromised would turn to international law to evaluate its response options and any potential recourse the attacker owes. The injured satellite operator will want assurances and effective enforcement measures from the law that discourage and disincentivize hostile actors from committing attacks.\n### A. Prevention and Risk Mitigation: How Hacking Satellites Violates International Law\nThe space law treaties say little specifically about how States can prevent against possible cyber military or terrorist attacks in space but are more concerned with the peaceful use and exploration of outer space for the “province of all [hu]mankind.” However, there are various ways that general international law can be violated when a hacker invades a government or private satellite’s network.\nFirst, a cyber-attack, depending on its nature and scope, could qualify as a violation of international law because it is a prohibited “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Second, a cyber-attack may constitute a violation of a State’s territorial\n---\n See Elizabeth Howell, *What Is A Satellite?*, SPACE.COM (Oct. 27, 2017), https://www.space.com/24839-satellites.html.\n Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. III.\n *Id.* at art. I.\n See UN Charter art. 2(4). For instance, a hacker State could use prohibited force against another State directly by interfering with its weather or Internet communications, causing technology failures, transportation shutdowns, or emergency responses that would likely cause significant physical damage. This type of hack would more clearly qualify as a use of force because it resulted in physical damage, even if the hacker was not using armed force in the traditional sense. Alternatively, a more indirect use of force could be economic in nature, such as collapsing a State’s stock exchange system or financial institutions, which would be more difficult to show as a violation of the UN Charter.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsovereignty. But whether a violation of international law actually occurs will be highly context specific.\ni. Cyber-Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite’s Network As a “Use of Force” Prohibited by the United Nations Charter\nWhether the UN’s prohibition against the use of force, and exception for self-defense measures, applies to cyberspace is generally unresolved by international law and highly dependent on each State’s particular interpretation of the Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter says that States may use force in self-defense or in anticipation of an impending attack “if an armed attack occurs.” Although cyber activities are not “armed” in the traditional sense, a successful cyber operation against a satellite system could qualify as an armed attack under international law depending on the circumstances of the attack. The theory accepted by most States on Article 2(4)’s applicability in cyberspace argues that an attack may be deemed “armed” if its scope and effect are equivalent to that of a\n A cyber-attack that crosses State borders, unlike traditional violations of territorial sovereignty, is more difficult to determine because of the intangible nature of cyberspace. If a hacker caused massive amounts of damage to another State across the globe, without ever actually setting foot in that State, it would be difficult to argue that the hacker violated traditional principles of sovereignty, which focuses on a State’s exclusive jurisdiction over physical territory. See supra note 100.\n UN Charter arts. 2(4); see also art. 51 (permitting States to use force in self defense against an armed attack).\n See Benedikt Pirker, supra note 99.\n Id. Depending on the target, extent of damage, intentions of the attacker, and a variety of other factual circumstances, a cyber attack may or may not qualify as a “use of force” under the UN Charter. While hackers generally are not “armed” in the traditional sense of having physical weapons, they could cause massive damage to variety of information and communications systems through malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, zero-day exploits, or domain name system (DNS) tunnelling. See What is a Cyberattack? CISCO (last visited Sept. 6, 2022), https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html#-types-of-cyber-attacks.\nFor instance, a malware attack, commonly understood as a cyber-attack using malicious software to breach a network vulnerability and block access, install harmful software, steal data, or render the system inoperable, that shut down aviation systems could qualify as a prohibited use of force because it would cause massive damage to a State’s transportation infrastructure and was clearly intended to disrupt those communication systems. See id. By contrast, a man-in-the middle attack that merely eavesdrops and obtains information from an important government transaction may be damaging and potentially illegal, but would be less likely to qualify as a use of force under the UN Charter. See id.; UN Charter art. 2(4).\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 427\nphysical attack. Other theories take a more holistic view and consider various factors such as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legality. This section focuses on the “effects” test, as it is the test followed by most States and the US.\nUnder the “effects” test, a hacker that intentionally causes physical damage to a satellite will have violated the UN’s prohibition on force and thus committed an internationally wrongful act. The US in particular considers “clandestine” military operations conducted in cyberspace to be traditional military activity. For instance, if Chinese military operatives were to intentionally invade a US military satellite network to destroy it or cause it to collide into another satellite in space, this conduct would violate the UN Charter’s prohibition under the US interpretation because the operatives have caused clear tangible damage to US military assets.\nHowever, if the cyber intrusion causes more of an economic or dignitary harm, such as information theft, that does not have a direct physical effect, delineating between permissible and prohibited acts under international law becomes less clear. The ICJ has ruled on drawing this line in *Nicaragua v. United States* when it found that the US merely funding Nicaraguan guerillas who opposed their government did not use prohibited force against the State. The US did use force, however, when it armed and trained those forces, even without any immediate physical effects. This case suggests that some additional, and intentional, steps must be taken by hackers beyond mere access for an intrusion to constitute a prohibited use of force under the effects test. So, if Chinese military operatives only gained access to a satellite communications system merely to infiltrate the system, as they allegedly did in 2007 and\n This theory is referred to as the “effects” test.

Cyber Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite's Network as a Violation of a State's Territorial Sovereignty\nA State can also violate international law with a cyber intrusion if it interferes with another State's sovereignty or territorial integrity. Like with the UN prohibition against the use of force, drawing the line between legal conduct and an illegal violation of State sovereignty can be murky. In the Corfu Channel Case, for instance, the ICJ found that the United Kingdom (UK) did not violate Albania's sovereignty when its warships passed through Albanian waters during World War II without permission from the government but did when it went back into the waters to conduct minesweeping operations later on. While some amount of coercion will not amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty, when an interference crosses the line to become a prohibited intervention, this will violate international law. In the cyber context, a minor interference, such as the alleged Chinese interference in 2007 and 2008, that causes little or no disturbance or damage, would likely not qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty because it is more akin to \"passing through.\" But, at certain point, a cyber interference could become a sovereignty violation when it rises to the level of the minesweeping activity in the Corfu Channel Case. Following the reasoning of this case, a State who infiltrates a satellite system merely to \"pass through\" would likely not violate international law. But taking data, damaging the satellite, or manipulating its transmission would be more akin to \"minesweeping\" and thus a\n See Wolf, supra note 3.\n Id.\n See Pirker, supra note 99, at 192.\n Id.\n U.K. v.

Unlike a channel of water that clearly sits within a State’s physical borders, cyberspace, like outer space, has been argued to be a “global commons.” A global commons is an area located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any particular State to which all nations have access. The Outer Space Treaty suggests that outer space is a global commons when it calls it the province of all of humankind. However, cyberspace, unlike outer space, more suitably falls under the sovereign jurisdiction of individual States. For one, cyberspace is run by physical servers and modems, and when a virus is transmitted to a network, it can be traced to a physical source. Additionally, States can prevent others from accessing their content outside of the country because they have their own Internet regulators, filters and IP addresses. By contrast, outer space still exists within physical space and is not subject to the same constraints and regulation as the Internet. But any State is free to explore outer space without permission from another State. It has no physical territory of origin because it exists all\n Id.\n Id.\n U.K v.Alb., 1949 I.C.J. at 35-36.\n See Pirker, supra note 99, at 195.\n See OFF. OF THE U.N. HIGH COMM’R FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ET AL., UN SYSTEM TASK TEAM ON THE POST-2015 UN DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 5 (2013) [hereinafter UN TASK TEAM AGENDA].\n See Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art. I. Although the US has not officially recognized outer space as a global commons, there is an argument for deeming it one due to the language in the treaty. The four universally recognized global commons include Antarctica, the atmosphere, the oceans and seas and outer space. See UN TASK TEAM AGENDA, supra note 135.\n See generally Pirker, supra note 99.\n Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, arts. I, II (explaining that outer space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty).\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\naround the Earth, more akin to the sea, rather than cyberspace, and is thus appropriately considered, in the author's view, a global common.\nOne could possibly interpret the Outer Space Treaty as suggesting that, if outer space is deemed a global common, so are the objects placed into outer space. Satellites, however, are still owned and operated by States and private companies that own and operate facilities on Earth. Hackers will generally invade the physical server located on Earth that will then send signals and commands to the space-based object. So, even if satellites were not subject to national appropriation once launched into outer space, most hacking occurs on the Earth. Additionally, even if a hacker attacked a satellite in space directly, such as through an ASAT weapon, the satellite is the property of the State or private company. While space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation, property launched into space is. Thus, a major cyber-attack against a State or privately-owned satellite would likely be deemed a violation of State sovereignty, presuming it qualifies as more than just \"passing through.\"\n## B. State Response and Redress\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides that States should bear international responsibility, distinguished from liability, for national activities in outer space. The law of State responsibility governs how States may respond to acts of aggression under international law. However, there are often rogue hackers whose actions cannot be attributable to a State government. Likewise, the Liability Convention expands on the Outer Space Treaty, providing a special framework for State liability for damage that a State causes object. Because this Convention was adopted before the existence of the Internet and when only a few States conducted activities in\n Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art. VIII (explaining that space objects retain the jurisdiction of the launching State and/or the State of Registry).\n See e.g., Tucker, supra note 63.\n See Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

However, a hostile actor who damages a satellite system through cyberspace, even if associated with the State itself, will rarely be launching anything, and even if it were, it is not a space object causing damage but a computer virus or malware.\ni. Determining International Responsibility and Response Options\nIf a State violates international law, either directly or through its organs or agents, it generally must make reparation through restitution for the loss or injury and may be responded against by the injured State. Even if the source of a virus or malware can be traced to the territory of a particular State, the hack could have been orchestrated by a rogue actor unassociated with the government. If so, public international law provides little recourse, and the affected party must seek alternative relief. Often, a State is only suspected of sponsoring a cyberattack or is not even involved at all. For instance, in the OPM hack, the US government traced the source of the data breach to Chinese nationals but could not formally link them to the government, at least at first. In this particular case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later charged four members of the Chinese military with the hack and explicitly tied the attack to Beijing. This case is an outlier because the US was very close to eventually being able to attribute the hackers to the Chinese government, though could not do so definitively, but in many cases, attribution to the State or even\n See Stefan A. Kaiser &amp; Martha Mejía-Kaiser, Cyber Security in Air and Space Law, 64 Z.L.W. 396, 406-07 (2015).\n A State may still be internationally responsible if it does not act directly but directs or controls other actors. See DRAFT ARTICLES, supra note 103, arts. 2, 4, 8.\n See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS §§ 901, 905.\n “While no ‘smoking gun’ was found linking the attack to a specific perpetrator, the overwhelming consensus is that OPM was hacked by State-sponsored attackers working for the Chinese government. See Josh Fruhlinger, The OPM Hack Explained: Bad Security Practices Meet China’s Captain America, CSO (Feb. 12, 2020), https://www.csoonline.com/article/3318238/the-opm-hack-explained-bad-security-practices-meet-chinas-captain-america.html.\n But the US rarely files criminal charges against foreign intelligence officers for fear of retaliation. Id.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsuspected attribution cannot be determined at all because the hackers cannot be found or have no provable links to the government.\nAttributing a cyberattack to a State can be a difficult process. First, identifying hackers can be technically challenging because they use third-party proxies and other concealment tools to mask their activities. Additionally, international law lacks streamlined norms regarding cyberactivity, which makes formal attribution impractical. According to Tallinn 2.0, “[c]yber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” In addition, a State is responsible for intentionally aiding or assisting, directing or controlling, or coercing another State to violate international law. But this has proved difficult to show. For instance, officials suspected that those responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016 were linked to the Russian government, but it was not until the end of the year, after the election of President Trump, that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency formally declared that the Russian government interfered with the election, after almost a year of research, intelligence gathering and reporting. Presumably, hackers who could infiltrate a highly secure satellite network will have to be pretty sophisticated, making it easier to hide their tracks. Thus, the rise of unidentifiable hackers or those with weak ties to State governments makes attribution less likely.\nAssuming that a cyberattack can be attributed to a State, and that that attack was a violation of international law, the Outer Space Treaty provides guidance as to what recourse and remedies are available to States after an attack has occurred. In certain\n Id.\n See William Banks, State Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0, 95 TEX. L.

In the cyber context, this could include a retaliatory cyberattack, economic sanctions, or, if serious enough, the use of physical force. The US policy, for instance, under the Trump administration, was to meet any harmful interference of space assets in cyberspace “with a deliberate response at a time, place, manner, and domain of our choosing.” International law will permit such a response if it is proportional to the initial hostile act.\n## ii. State Liability for Damage Caused by a Cyber Attack\nA cyberattack could compromise a satellite by causing clear physical damage or indirect damage to the satellite operator’s economic, informational, or intellectual property assets. It is much easier for a State to recover for physical damage because it can simply sue for damage to property. The Liability Convention, however, only provides recourse for damage caused by space objects by the “launching State.” A State whose agents attack another State’s satellite networks via the Internet is not necessarily launching a space object as the Convention requires. The Convention provides liability in a narrow set of circumstances. An intrusion may be just as damaging but only cause intellectual property or economic damage, such as when the hacker takes military intelligence stored in the satellite’s network or disrupts satellite navigational or communication signals, without directly causing any physical damage. But when it was adopted in the 1970s, the drafters of the\nwith the provisions set forth in the present [t]reaty.” Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

Interpreting the Convention's language as applying to more intangible aggression in space goes directly against the treaty's plain text. Thus, the Liability Convention would not provide a remedy unless interpreted very broadly since any State or non-State actor that hacks a satellite network will almost certainly not be physically launching an object into space. However, the State could still take the responsible party to the ICJ or domestic courts because domestic law is really where most of the regulation on data security and violations of intellectual property exist, subject to the sovereign immunity exceptions, and could succeed in such a claim depending on the nature of the attack and amount of damage caused.\n## IV. SUGGESTIONS FOR REFORM\n## A. Adopting New Treaties or Amending the Current Rules\nIn theory, States could convene to create a new treaty or, at the very least, amend the current treaties to create broader language that is more suitable to addressing intangible cyber threats to satellite systems. For instance, the Liability Convention's requirement of a \"launching State\" does not account for anything other than physical damage caused by another State's launch.[167] However, this seemingly most obvious solution is probably the most unrealistic. First, completing this goal would be a long, arduous process with every State having different interests. Even if it succeeded, by the time a new treaty was adopted, the technology will no doubt out pace any agreement.[168] Additionally, there have been attempts to adopt new space-related treaties that have failed.[169] Amended treaties and additional international legal instruments that provide stronger cybersecurity protections may work temporarily but not long-term and would be met with much resistance.\n\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 435\n## B. International Cooperation and Implementing More Adaptive Standards\nBecause of the inherently global nature of both cyberspace and satellites, international cooperation among States is crucial to set a baseline of international legal norms that protect satellites and satellite communications from cyber interferences. According to Blount, the primary sources that govern space law lack sufficient enforcement mechanisms. Cybersecurity laws are a scattered and inconsistent collection of domestic laws and international norms that States have been slow to adopt. Implementing specific cybersecurity laws at the international level, particularly ones directly aimed at or capable of protecting space assets, could create a false sense of security for a time, until technology changes again, and complying with the law no longer mitigates risk. Although satellite operators will feel pressure to establish cybersecurity practices and standards within international space law, to maximize the Internet security of these satellites, cooperative efforts among States is necessary to protect the networks and avoid potential conflict in outer space.\nPerhaps there is a way to follow Blount’s approach of focusing on international cooperation and implementing adaptable standards in addition to adopting some rigid international legal instruments, or amendments to the current ones, as a long-term goal. The combination of hard legal rules with malleable standards and international cooperation could account both for the need for stricter enforcement and clearer legal rules and address Blount’s concern that technology will outpace the law. If adopting or amending a treaty is currently infeasible, perhaps the UN could impose declarations, principles, or even resolutions that reinterpret the UN Charter’s provisions to account for these new threats that the original drafters did not anticipate. Adopting an international body dedicated to cybersecurity in outer space, similar to COPUOS, could also be a potential solution, simply to bring all the relevant parties to the table to address this vexing problem.\n---\n Blount, *supra* note 65, at 273.\n *Id.* at 293.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe convergence of cyberspace and outer space presents novel questions within space law and international law in general. Both space law and cybersecurity law are new areas, and cybersecurity law has continued to evolve and change with technology while space law has remained relatively stagnant. The novelty of these areas of the law, along with the unique physical nature of space and the intangibility of cyberspace, makes it difficult to determine what sorts of cyber intrusions to space satellite systems violate international law. While there is no clear answer as to how exactly the international legal community should deal with this problem, plenty of authority stemming from traditional international law can be utilized. Additionally, States have several options moving forward to ensure the protection of these highly sensitive space-based systems and provide relief to victims of hacks. Although adopting new international legal instruments, or modifying the current ones, would be the ideal solution, it would be unlikely to garner much support considering the various interests of the various nations. Perhaps this can remain a long-term goal, but in the meantime, States should work cooperatively, with strong support from the private sector, to adopt international legal norms and practices in the form of declarations, principles, resolutions, State practice, and perhaps even the creation of an international body dedicated to the protection of satellite systems, and other Internet-powered space technologies, in outer space.",

In recent years, land-based cyber intrusions, hacks and data breaches, including ones against Equifax, Sony, the Democratic National Committee and the Office of Personnel Management, exposed masses of consumer data and compromised the networks of various private companies and governmental organizations. These significant events caused great harm to the organizations, the economy and the public. Cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for public and private organizations in recent years. However, the issue has not been meaningfully addressed among the international legal community, particularly within the space sector. If a hostile actor were to successfully infiltrate the networks of major satellite systems that orbit the Earth, which the world relies on for, among other things, communication, navigation, weather monitoring, national security and military operations, the consequences could be catastrophic. This Note addresses what sorts of cyber-attacks or intrusions to a satellite system would constitute a violation of international law and to what degree a State can respond and receive reparation for damage, either physical or otherwise, caused.

The Note applies the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force, the law of State responsibility, sovereignty and other principles of international law to hypothesize how the current international regime could address such a scenario. It concludes with the suggestion that: 1) the international space law community adopt cooperative and streamlined norms, standards and initiatives that are adaptable to constantly evolving technologies, including the formation of an international body dedicated to cyber issues in outer space that would bring all relevant parties together; and 2) within that framework consider implementing amendments to the space law treaties as a long-term goal.\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nWhen a powerful Soviet satellite armed with electromagnetic pulse weaponry falls into the wrong hands, British intelligence agents had to risk their lives to prevent the space-based weapon from incapacitating electricity-powered technologies on Earth in a destructive blast. While this is the somewhat far-fetched plot of the 1995 James Bond film *Goldeneye*, the film illustrates the importance of artificial space-based satellites and the potential disaster that could result if a hostile actor gained control of one. Although no satellite capable of such mass destruction orbits the Earth currently, various military and civilian observation, communication, weather and navigational satellites, if compromised, could have similarly drastic consequences, particularly as satellite technologies advance and hostile intruders become more sophisticated, especially by utilizing Internet-based attacks.\nThe problem of an artificial satellite becoming compromised due to a cyber intrusion of its network is not completely theoretical. In 2007 and 2008, several United States (US) military satellites were hacked through a ground station in Norway—the Chinese\n See GOLDENEYE (United Artists 1995).\n See William Akoto, *What Happens When All the Tiny Satellites We’re Shooting Into Space Get Hacked?*, FAST COMPANY (Feb. 15, 2020), https://www.fastcompany.com/90464666/what-happens-when-all-the-tiny-satellites-were-shooting-into-space-get-hacked.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nmilitary is the prime suspect. A Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1 satellite, which are used for climate and terrain monitoring by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Geological Survey (USGS), each experienced several minutes of interference. Luckily, no commands were successfully sent to the satellite and no data was captured by the hackers. However, it is concerning that these adversary possibly State hackers managed to infiltrate a highly sensitive network and gain access to the satellites' controls. Attempts did not end there. Another hacking campaign, allegedly by the Chinese again, occurred in 2018 when hackers intruded into the networks of satellite operators of private defense contractors and telecommunications companies. Although the international space community is beginning to consider the consequences of a successful hacking campaign on space technologies, it is only a matter of time before a State, one of its agents, or even an unidentifiable non-State actor successfully infiltrates a crucial commercial or government-owned satellite system and damages, destroys, steals sensitive data or manipulates its transmission.\nSatellites today are capable of a variety of functionality and have highly advanced technological capability.

Of particular note, cyber-attacks became more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving networks more vulnerable due to the disrupted economy and rise of teleworking. For instance, China may have attempted to hack American vaccine data. Networks can be infiltrated more easily when employees work from home, often from their own personal devices.

Such interferences are disturbing because, while the hackers did not actually exercise control of the satellites in these instances, they achieved all steps required for command and could access satellites with more sensitive functions in the future.

Now more than ever is the time to start taking cybersecurity more seriously.\nA major breach of certain satellite networks by sophisticated actors could have drastic effects, depending on the intentions of the intruder. For instance, the US military uses the USA 224 satellite for detailed spying all around the Earth for military activities. If that satellite were compromised, hackers could acquire invaluable and classified US intelligence, threaten US military operations and perhaps even manipulate the satellite's transmission to complete military objectives adverse to the interests of the US. Similarly, a hacker could also disrupt a geostationary weather satellite, such as the GOES series, causing weather prediction to be disrupted, or one of the many commercial telecommunications satellites that power critical infrastructure. Other disruptions could affect air traffic controls, cable and network television broadcasts, cell-phone communications, military intelligence and environmental monitoring. Current space law would likely never allow the launching of a satellite like Goldeneye with nuclear capabilities specifically designed as an electromagnetic weapon. But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today. It is crucial that the law can account for hackers' ability to use sophisticated and constantly advancing technologies to access\n Geoff Brumfiel, Amateurs Identify U.S. Spy Satellite Behind President Trump's Tweet, NPR (Sept. 2, 2019), https://www.npr.org/2019/09/02/756673481/amateurs-identify-u-s-spy-satellite-behind-president-trumps-tweet.\n See NOAA GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE SERVER (last visited on May 11, 2020), https://www.goes.noaa.gov/.\n What Are Satellites Used For?, UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS (Feb. 13, 2014), https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-are-satellites-used#:~:text=Satellites%20can%20detect%20underground%20water,erosion%20of%20topsoil%20from%20land.\n The Outer Space Treaty, which will be discussed in more detail in later sections, prohibits any nuclear weapons from being placed in Earth's orbit, and, although it does not explicitly prohibit other non-nuclear weapons, a device capable of such destruction would violate the treaty's notional requirement that outer space be used for peaceful purposes. See Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Jan. 27, 1967, 18 U.S.T. 2410, 610 U.N.T.S. 205, arts.

In particular, it is unclear exactly how current international law, which is still evolving in both the cyber and space realms, could disincentivize hackers and provide States with sufficient response options or remedies. This question is particularly difficult to answer since there is no clear international framework governing cybersecurity on its own let alone cybersecurity in space. Additionally, the distinctive physical nature of both cyberspace and outer space presents challenges as to how these laws apply. Although the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in outer space, other means of destroying or interfering with a satellite are not directly prohibited by any of the five main treaties governing outer space. However, the major principles drawn from those\n See Brian Barrett, *How 4 Chinese Hackers Allegedly Took Down Equifax*, WIRED (Feb. 10, 2020), https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-hack-china/.\n Although many States have enacted their own domestic cybersecurity laws, there is not much governing such activities on the international plane.

IV.\n See Stephens &amp; Blake, *supra* note 12. In addition to the Outer Space Treaty mentioned previously, there are four other relevant treaties for a total of five space law treaties. The Rescue Agreement elaborates on elements of articles V and VIII of the Outer Space Treaty, providing that States take all possible steps to rescue and assist astronauts in distress and promptly return them to the launching State and that States, upon request, assist launching states in recovering space objects outside the launching State’s territory. Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space, Apr. 22, 1968, 19 U.S.T. 7570.\nThe Liability Convention elaborates on article VII of the Outer Space Treaty, providing that a launching State should be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space objects on the surface of Earth or to aircraft and due to activities in space. It also provides procedures for settling claims for damages. Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Mar. 29, 1972, 24 U.S.T. 2389 [hereinafter Liability Convention].\n\ntreaties, along with other areas of international law, such as the law of State responsibility, the United Nations (UN) prohibition against the use of force and principles of sovereignty, may offer some guidance. Despite the recognition of cybersecurity’s importance on outer space technologies by many in the international space community, the current legal framework warrants improvement. A streamlined, cooperative legal approach at the international, domestic and market levels is still needed.\nPart II of this Note discusses the background and history of the space race alongside the emergence of the Internet and how space and nuclear-capable States have developed into major cybersecurity threats against one another. Part III outlines the current international space law and general international law, most relevant to the issue of cyber intrusions against satellites. Part IV addresses specifically how current law can prevent and mitigate the risk of cyber-security breaches of artificial satellites and discusses what international resources and remedies are available if such an event were to occur. It posits that the current international legal framework is insufficient and suggests possible reforms to the law and other cooperative actions that the international space law community should take, including the formation of new UN body\nThe Registration Convention builds upon the Outer Space Treaty, Rescue Agreement, and Liability Convention creates a mechanism to help States identify space objects by expanding the scope of the UN Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space and addressed issues relating to State parties’ responsibilities concerning space objects.

Additionally, and that the Moon and its natural resources are the common heritage of mankind and that an international regime should be established to govern the exploitation of such resources if exploitation becomes feasible.

BACKGROUND\n## A. The Cold War’s Significance on the Space Race Alongside the Internet’s Development\nThe Cold War solidified the status of Russia, at that time the Soviet Union, and the US as the two primary players in both the space race and the nuclear arms race. Space was linked to nuclear disarmament during this period. After the 1967 launch of Sputnik, the world’s first artificial satellite, into orbit by the Soviet Union, the US and the Soviet Union competed in their space capabilities with various launches and experiments. The US capabilities demonstrably surpassed the Soviets with Apollo 8 orbiting the Moon and Apollo 11 putting humans on the Moon at the end of the decade. In fact, the Moon landing may even have been a catalyst to the end of the Cold War and the cementing of the US’s advantage over the Soviets in the nuclear arms and space races. Notably, the same technology used to launch Sputnik into space was intended by the Soviets as a way to deliver intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBMs).\nAt the same time, the Internet was developed largely as a reaction to the events of the Cold War. The US military created\n See Bradley G. Shreve, *The US, the USSR, and Space Exploration, 1957-1963*, 20 INT’L J.

During the height of the Cold War, the US military further developed this network to communicate faster in the event of a nuclear attack. Eventually, this technology evolved into the Internet the world knows today.\nBefore long, the Internet was subject to various vulnerabilities in its network. The first computer virus was discovered in 1971 during the ARPANET age. By 1983, the US filed its first patent for cybersecurity protection to prevent these intrusions. Beginning in the early 2000s, State and non-State hackers became more organized and sophisticated. For instance, Anonymous, the first major hacker group, committed various attacks against governmental organizations and corporations, mainly in the name of privacy. By the 2010s, the US began to identify even more sophisticated security breaches committed by State-sponsored intelligence operatives for the first time. Today, cybersecurity is a major concern for individuals, governments and corporations as organizations rely almost exclusively on Internet-capable technologies. Most organizations today have information technology departments, a chief information officer (CIO), specific policies and technical measures to prevent and respond to cyber incidents or attacks and even a team of employees dedicated to cybersecurity prevention and response.\n Ben Tarnoff, *How the Internet Was Invented*, THE GUARDIAN (July 15, 2016), https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf.\n Spencer Bruttig &amp; Matt Gregory, *Here’s How the Cold War Helped Create the Internet We Know and Love Today*, WUSA9 (Dec. 6, 2019), https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/this-week-in-history-how-the-internet-was-created-during-the-cold-war/507-41b19bed-f500-4d66-a565-c72de578a7d0.\n Tim Matthew, *A Brief History of Cybersecurity*, CYBERSECURITY INSIDERS (last visited March 2, 2020), https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/a-brief-history-of-cybersecurity/.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.

In the US, for instance, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the main entity in charge of ensuring that government agencies have adequate standards and security policies in place and follow the government-sponsored guidance while the National Security Agency (NSA) has developed its own cyber-attack methods for responding to and hacking into the networks of adversary States.

But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today, so it is crucial that space law can account for the fact that evolving technologies create new ways for hackers to access these systems. Today, most devices, including satellites, rely on the Internet, and with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), that will only increase.\nHistory shows that satellites are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which scholar P. J. Blount argues are merely one form of IoT, and given the rise of military activities in outer space and military cyber espionage and attacks, there is no reason to doubt that a State or nonaligned hacker group may attempt to infiltrate and\nand stealing trade secrets and highly personal data from millions of Americans.

The Chinese have already been suspected of successfully gained access to the Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1. The Pentagon has also reported that both the Chinese and Russians are developing lasers and a host of other anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, which could track, study, or even target adversary satellites through physical, kinetic, microwave and cyber technologies. This Pentagon report also apparently indicated that the Chinese and Russians are preparing to employ offensive and defensive ASAT technology, which could extend to cyber infiltration of satellites as well.\nBlount argues that it is only a matter of time before military conflict occurs in outer space. He notes that although China and the US have developed ASAT technologies, no legal instrument has been adopted to regulate them. Blount goes on to suggest that the rules of armed conflict from international humanitarian law should extend to military activities in space. Blount’s ideas serve as a useful starting point in examining what sorts of international rules could be adopted to effectively regulate and prevent cyber attacks against satellites.\n## II. CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REGIME\nBoth international law in general and international space law in particular provide legal protections to both States and private satellite operators to ensure the security of their satellites in space. Because there are only five treaties governing space activities specifically, much of the law applicable to cybersecurity of satellites comes from general public international law, which the Outer Space Treaty says governs outer space activities as well.\n See Wolf, supra note 3.\n These ASATs may employ microwave, radiofrequency jamming, laser, chemical spraying, kinetic kill and robotic technologies to attack satellites. See Patrick Tucker, China, Russia Building Attack Satellites and Space Lasers: Pentagon Report, DEFENSE ONE (Feb. 12, 2019), https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/02/china-russia-building-attack-satellites-and-space-lasers-pentagon-report/154819/.\n See id.\n P.J.

III.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 419\nAdditionally, the nature of cyberspace, because it is intangible, presents many challenges that traditional international law does not address. Due to its infancy, even more so than space exploration, there is no clear standard of international legal norms in the area of cybersecurity. Rather, there are mostly theories and suggestions as to how the traditional rules and principles apply in this new domain.\nAccording to Article 38 of the Statute governing the International Court of Justice (ICJ), public international law consists of three primary sources: (1) international conventions, (2) international custom, as evidence of general practice accepted as law and (3) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations. In addition, judicial decisions and the “teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations” may serve as subsidiary sources. Finally, there are various other sources of soft law, such as memoranda of understanding, recommendations, principles and resolutions, which lack the same enforcement measures of “hard law” but serve as useful persuasive authority. These subsidiary sources are particularly useful in space law considering the field’s infancy, even more so compared to space law due to the recent advance of computer technology, and lack of internationally binding legal instruments.\n## A. Treaties\n### i. The Outer Space Treaty\nThe foundational international convention governing space activities is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. According to the Treaty, all space activities should be carried out in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, in the interest of maintaining peace, security, cooperation and understanding, and States should act with “due regard” to the interests of all other parties to\n See Duggal, supra note 22.\n Statute of the International Court of Justice Art. 38 June 26 1945, 6 L.N.T.S. 391-413.\n Id. at art. 38.4\n See Francis Lyall &amp; Paul B. Larsen, Space Law: A Treatise 47-48 (Routledge ed., 2d ed. 2018).\n Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20.\n\nthe treaty. Thus, treaties, custom and other sources of general international law also govern outer space activities.\nAdditionally, the placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in space is prohibited. However, nothing in the treaty addresses non-nuclear space weapons explicitly, though Article IV says that the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used only for peaceful purposes, but launching other types of weapons into space, depending on the purpose and capability of destruction, could go against the Treaty’s overall object and purpose of maintaining peace and security. Nevertheless, the Treaty does not explicitly prohibit non-physical threats, such as cyber intrusions.\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides for some redress for violations of international law. States who conduct national activities in outer space bear “international responsibility” for such activities but are only “liable” for physical damage caused by space objects they launch into outer space whereas the Liability Convention expands in more detail on when a State actually must pay for damages.\n## ii. The Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention provides that States should pay for damage caused by objects the State launches into outer space. Liability should be distinguished from “international responsibility.” Specifically, it states that “[a] launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.” If damage is caused elsewhere, the launching State “shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” But the Convention defines “damage” as death,\n---\n *Id.* at arts.

See Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. VI.\n Liability Convention, *supra* note 25, art. II.\n *Id.* at art. III.\n2021]\nCOMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS\n\niii. The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter, the foundational treaty of the United Nations (UN), governs outer space activities per Article III of the Outer Space Treaty.84 The Charter, among many other things, prohibits the use of force and requires States to resolve disputes by peaceful means unless the UN approves the use of force by resolution or the State uses force in self-defense.85 These principles raise the question of whether hacking, jamming or interfering with satellites through cyberspace constitutes a use of force because it is not necessarily an “armed” attack in the traditional sense.86\niv. Budapest Convention on Cybercrime\nAlthough many US states have domestic privacy and data security laws,87 there is no real international standard regarding how\n\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nnation-States should handle cyber-security attacks. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is the first and only international convention that specifically seeks to address Internet crime. The treaty attempts to harmonize the laws addressing copyright infringement, computer fraud, child pornography and violations of network security. However, it only has sixty-seven signatories, and its scope is narrow. Despite the original intention that the Convention apply globally, the US only ratified it in 2006, while various States that hold strong nationalism and sovereignty views, such as Russia, unsurprisingly, oppose it. It has garnered little recognition and significance since its adoption.\n## B. Custom\n## i.

State practice on this principle can be seen in various treaties, statements, principles and policies from space-capable nations. There is even a body in the UN dedicated to maintaining peace, security and development in outer space—the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPOUS)—as well as a legal subcommittee. However, defining what “peaceful purposes” actually means can be difficult, especially when considering the intangible nature of cyberspace.\n## ii. Violating Another State’s Sovereignty\nStates can violate international law by interfering with another State’s sovereignty or territorial integrity. Territorial sovereignty means that a State exercises complete and exclusive jurisdiction over its physical territory. The ICJ has stressed that “respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.” Traditionally, whether a State violated another State’s sovereignty could easily be determined because it was dependent on physical borders. However, determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation can be difficult in the space and cyber context due to its cross-border nature and the fact that a hack might not actually occur in outer space but rather through servers on Earth.\n## iii. The Law of State Responsibility and Attribution\nThe law of State responsibility imposes several international rights and duties on States in the event of a violation of\n See Blount, supra note 59, at 2.\n Id.\n See Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, U.N.

States who commit an internationally wrongful act, either through a State organ or by an entity under the instruction or control of the State, owe reparations to the injured party. An injured State may also respond with countermeasures that are proportional to the original violation and are necessary to stop, prevent, or remedy the violation, subject to the limitations of the UN Charter. However, the perpetrators of many cyber-attacks cannot even be identified, let alone officially attributed to a State, and thus a State cannot be held internationally responsible. While there is little authority on State attribution in the cyber context, the *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* serves as a useful reference guide on the current State of customary international law, particularly on this topic.\n## C. Subsidiary Sources and Soft Law\nIn addition to treaties and customary international law, subsidiary sources can be a useful, additional authority. These could include opinions from the ICJ on general subjects of international law. Given the novelty of cyberattacks on space assets, scholarly commentary are also useful sources, especially considering the lack of established binding legal authority in this area. Additionally, Unite Nations principles, declarations and resolutions serve as useful “soft law” that do not have the same binding effect as treaties and other primary sources of international law. They are indicative, however, of State practice and international consensus.\n---\n See DRAFT ARTICLES ON RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS WITH COMMENTARY ARTS. 2, 4, 8, INT’L LAW COMM’N 2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf ([hereinafter DRAFT ARTICLES].\n *Id.*\n See *id.* § 905.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL 2.0 *supra* note 88.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 425\n## III. HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN PREVENT AND PROVIDE REDRESS FOR A MAJOR CYBER-ATTACK ON A SATELLITE SYSTEM\nA successful cyber-attack on a satellite could interfere with the space object’s flight control, payload control or transmission. Because the Outer Space Treaty says that space activities are governed by international law, if such an attack were to occur, the State or private company whose satellite was compromised would turn to international law to evaluate its response options and any potential recourse the attacker owes. The injured satellite operator will want assurances and effective enforcement measures from the law that discourage and disincentivize hostile actors from committing attacks.\n### A. Prevention and Risk Mitigation: How Hacking Satellites Violates International Law\nThe space law treaties say little specifically about how States can prevent against possible cyber military or terrorist attacks in space but are more concerned with the peaceful use and exploration of outer space for the “province of all [hu]mankind.” However, there are various ways that general international law can be violated when a hacker invades a government or private satellite’s network.\nFirst, a cyber-attack, depending on its nature and scope, could qualify as a violation of international law because it is a prohibited “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Second, a cyber-attack may constitute a violation of a State’s territorial\n---\n See Elizabeth Howell, *What Is A Satellite?*, SPACE.COM (Oct. 27, 2017), https://www.space.com/24839-satellites.html.\n Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. III.\n *Id.* at art. I.\n See UN Charter art. 2(4). For instance, a hacker State could use prohibited force against another State directly by interfering with its weather or Internet communications, causing technology failures, transportation shutdowns, or emergency responses that would likely cause significant physical damage. This type of hack would more clearly qualify as a use of force because it resulted in physical damage, even if the hacker was not using armed force in the traditional sense. Alternatively, a more indirect use of force could be economic in nature, such as collapsing a State’s stock exchange system or financial institutions, which would be more difficult to show as a violation of the UN Charter.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsovereignty. But whether a violation of international law actually occurs will be highly context specific.\ni. Cyber-Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite’s Network As a “Use of Force” Prohibited by the United Nations Charter\nWhether the UN’s prohibition against the use of force, and exception for self-defense measures, applies to cyberspace is generally unresolved by international law and highly dependent on each State’s particular interpretation of the Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter says that States may use force in self-defense or in anticipation of an impending attack “if an armed attack occurs.” Although cyber activities are not “armed” in the traditional sense, a successful cyber operation against a satellite system could qualify as an armed attack under international law depending on the circumstances of the attack. The theory accepted by most States on Article 2(4)’s applicability in cyberspace argues that an attack may be deemed “armed” if its scope and effect are equivalent to that of a\n A cyber-attack that crosses State borders, unlike traditional violations of territorial sovereignty, is more difficult to determine because of the intangible nature of cyberspace. If a hacker caused massive amounts of damage to another State across the globe, without ever actually setting foot in that State, it would be difficult to argue that the hacker violated traditional principles of sovereignty, which focuses on a State’s exclusive jurisdiction over physical territory. See supra note 100.\n UN Charter arts. 2(4); see also art. 51 (permitting States to use force in self defense against an armed attack).\n See Benedikt Pirker, supra note 99.\n Id. Depending on the target, extent of damage, intentions of the attacker, and a variety of other factual circumstances, a cyber attack may or may not qualify as a “use of force” under the UN Charter. While hackers generally are not “armed” in the traditional sense of having physical weapons, they could cause massive damage to variety of information and communications systems through malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, zero-day exploits, or domain name system (DNS) tunnelling. See What is a Cyberattack? CISCO (last visited Sept. 6, 2022), https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html#-types-of-cyber-attacks.\nFor instance, a malware attack, commonly understood as a cyber-attack using malicious software to breach a network vulnerability and block access, install harmful software, steal data, or render the system inoperable, that shut down aviation systems could qualify as a prohibited use of force because it would cause massive damage to a State’s transportation infrastructure and was clearly intended to disrupt those communication systems. See id. By contrast, a man-in-the middle attack that merely eavesdrops and obtains information from an important government transaction may be damaging and potentially illegal, but would be less likely to qualify as a use of force under the UN Charter. See id.; UN Charter art. 2(4).\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 427\nphysical attack. Other theories take a more holistic view and consider various factors such as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legality. This section focuses on the “effects” test, as it is the test followed by most States and the US.\nUnder the “effects” test, a hacker that intentionally causes physical damage to a satellite will have violated the UN’s prohibition on force and thus committed an internationally wrongful act. The US in particular considers “clandestine” military operations conducted in cyberspace to be traditional military activity. For instance, if Chinese military operatives were to intentionally invade a US military satellite network to destroy it or cause it to collide into another satellite in space, this conduct would violate the UN Charter’s prohibition under the US interpretation because the operatives have caused clear tangible damage to US military assets.\nHowever, if the cyber intrusion causes more of an economic or dignitary harm, such as information theft, that does not have a direct physical effect, delineating between permissible and prohibited acts under international law becomes less clear. The ICJ has ruled on drawing this line in *Nicaragua v. United States* when it found that the US merely funding Nicaraguan guerillas who opposed their government did not use prohibited force against the State. The US did use force, however, when it armed and trained those forces, even without any immediate physical effects. This case suggests that some additional, and intentional, steps must be taken by hackers beyond mere access for an intrusion to constitute a prohibited use of force under the effects test. So, if Chinese military operatives only gained access to a satellite communications system merely to infiltrate the system, as they allegedly did in 2007 and\n This theory is referred to as the “effects” test.

Cyber Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite's Network as a Violation of a State's Territorial Sovereignty\nA State can also violate international law with a cyber intrusion if it interferes with another State's sovereignty or territorial integrity. Like with the UN prohibition against the use of force, drawing the line between legal conduct and an illegal violation of State sovereignty can be murky. In the Corfu Channel Case, for instance, the ICJ found that the United Kingdom (UK) did not violate Albania's sovereignty when its warships passed through Albanian waters during World War II without permission from the government but did when it went back into the waters to conduct minesweeping operations later on. While some amount of coercion will not amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty, when an interference crosses the line to become a prohibited intervention, this will violate international law. In the cyber context, a minor interference, such as the alleged Chinese interference in 2007 and 2008, that causes little or no disturbance or damage, would likely not qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty because it is more akin to \"passing through.\" But, at certain point, a cyber interference could become a sovereignty violation when it rises to the level of the minesweeping activity in the Corfu Channel Case. Following the reasoning of this case, a State who infiltrates a satellite system merely to \"pass through\" would likely not violate international law. But taking data, damaging the satellite, or manipulating its transmission would be more akin to \"minesweeping\" and thus a\n See Wolf, supra note 3.\n Id.\n See Pirker, supra note 99, at 192.\n Id.\n U.K. v.

Unlike a channel of water that clearly sits within a State’s physical borders, cyberspace, like outer space, has been argued to be a “global commons.” A global commons is an area located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any particular State to which all nations have access. The Outer Space Treaty suggests that outer space is a global commons when it calls it the province of all of humankind. However, cyberspace, unlike outer space, more suitably falls under the sovereign jurisdiction of individual States. For one, cyberspace is run by physical servers and modems, and when a virus is transmitted to a network, it can be traced to a physical source. Additionally, States can prevent others from accessing their content outside of the country because they have their own Internet regulators, filters and IP addresses. By contrast, outer space still exists within physical space and is not subject to the same constraints and regulation as the Internet. But any State is free to explore outer space without permission from another State. It has no physical territory of origin because it exists all\n Id.\n Id.\n U.K v.Alb., 1949 I.C.J. at 35-36.\n See Pirker, supra note 99, at 195.\n See OFF. OF THE U.N. HIGH COMM’R FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ET AL., UN SYSTEM TASK TEAM ON THE POST-2015 UN DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 5 (2013) [hereinafter UN TASK TEAM AGENDA].\n See Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art. I. Although the US has not officially recognized outer space as a global commons, there is an argument for deeming it one due to the language in the treaty. The four universally recognized global commons include Antarctica, the atmosphere, the oceans and seas and outer space. See UN TASK TEAM AGENDA, supra note 135.\n See generally Pirker, supra note 99.\n Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, arts. I, II (explaining that outer space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty).\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\naround the Earth, more akin to the sea, rather than cyberspace, and is thus appropriately considered, in the author's view, a global common.\nOne could possibly interpret the Outer Space Treaty as suggesting that, if outer space is deemed a global common, so are the objects placed into outer space. Satellites, however, are still owned and operated by States and private companies that own and operate facilities on Earth. Hackers will generally invade the physical server located on Earth that will then send signals and commands to the space-based object. So, even if satellites were not subject to national appropriation once launched into outer space, most hacking occurs on the Earth. Additionally, even if a hacker attacked a satellite in space directly, such as through an ASAT weapon, the satellite is the property of the State or private company. While space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation, property launched into space is. Thus, a major cyber-attack against a State or privately-owned satellite would likely be deemed a violation of State sovereignty, presuming it qualifies as more than just \"passing through.\"\n## B. State Response and Redress\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides that States should bear international responsibility, distinguished from liability, for national activities in outer space. The law of State responsibility governs how States may respond to acts of aggression under international law. However, there are often rogue hackers whose actions cannot be attributable to a State government. Likewise, the Liability Convention expands on the Outer Space Treaty, providing a special framework for State liability for damage that a State causes object. Because this Convention was adopted before the existence of the Internet and when only a few States conducted activities in\n Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

However, a hostile actor who damages a satellite system through cyberspace, even if associated with the State itself, will rarely be launching anything, and even if it were, it is not a space object causing damage but a computer virus or malware.\ni. Determining International Responsibility and Response Options\nIf a State violates international law, either directly or through its organs or agents, it generally must make reparation through restitution for the loss or injury and may be responded against by the injured State. Even if the source of a virus or malware can be traced to the territory of a particular State, the hack could have been orchestrated by a rogue actor unassociated with the government. If so, public international law provides little recourse, and the affected party must seek alternative relief. Often, a State is only suspected of sponsoring a cyberattack or is not even involved at all. For instance, in the OPM hack, the US government traced the source of the data breach to Chinese nationals but could not formally link them to the government, at least at first. In this particular case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later charged four members of the Chinese military with the hack and explicitly tied the attack to Beijing. This case is an outlier because the US was very close to eventually being able to attribute the hackers to the Chinese government, though could not do so definitively, but in many cases, attribution to the State or even\n See Stefan A. Kaiser &amp; Martha Mejía-Kaiser, Cyber Security in Air and Space Law, 64 Z.L.W. 396, 406-07 (2015).\n A State may still be internationally responsible if it does not act directly but directs or controls other actors. See DRAFT ARTICLES, supra note 103, arts. 2, 4, 8.\n See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS §§ 901, 905.\n “While no ‘smoking gun’ was found linking the attack to a specific perpetrator, the overwhelming consensus is that OPM was hacked by State-sponsored attackers working for the Chinese government. See Josh Fruhlinger, The OPM Hack Explained: Bad Security Practices Meet China’s Captain America, CSO (Feb. 12, 2020), https://www.csoonline.com/article/3318238/the-opm-hack-explained-bad-security-practices-meet-chinas-captain-america.html.\n But the US rarely files criminal charges against foreign intelligence officers for fear of retaliation. Id.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsuspected attribution cannot be determined at all because the hackers cannot be found or have no provable links to the government.\nAttributing a cyberattack to a State can be a difficult process. First, identifying hackers can be technically challenging because they use third-party proxies and other concealment tools to mask their activities. Additionally, international law lacks streamlined norms regarding cyberactivity, which makes formal attribution impractical. According to Tallinn 2.0, “[c]yber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” In addition, a State is responsible for intentionally aiding or assisting, directing or controlling, or coercing another State to violate international law. But this has proved difficult to show. For instance, officials suspected that those responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016 were linked to the Russian government, but it was not until the end of the year, after the election of President Trump, that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency formally declared that the Russian government interfered with the election, after almost a year of research, intelligence gathering and reporting. Presumably, hackers who could infiltrate a highly secure satellite network will have to be pretty sophisticated, making it easier to hide their tracks. Thus, the rise of unidentifiable hackers or those with weak ties to State governments makes attribution less likely.\nAssuming that a cyberattack can be attributed to a State, and that that attack was a violation of international law, the Outer Space Treaty provides guidance as to what recourse and remedies are available to States after an attack has occurred. In certain\n Id.\n See William Banks, State Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0, 95 TEX. L.

In the cyber context, this could include a retaliatory cyberattack, economic sanctions, or, if serious enough, the use of physical force. The US policy, for instance, under the Trump administration, was to meet any harmful interference of space assets in cyberspace “with a deliberate response at a time, place, manner, and domain of our choosing.” International law will permit such a response if it is proportional to the initial hostile act.\n## ii. State Liability for Damage Caused by a Cyber Attack\nA cyberattack could compromise a satellite by causing clear physical damage or indirect damage to the satellite operator’s economic, informational, or intellectual property assets. It is much easier for a State to recover for physical damage because it can simply sue for damage to property. The Liability Convention, however, only provides recourse for damage caused by space objects by the “launching State.” A State whose agents attack another State’s satellite networks via the Internet is not necessarily launching a space object as the Convention requires. The Convention provides liability in a narrow set of circumstances. An intrusion may be just as damaging but only cause intellectual property or economic damage, such as when the hacker takes military intelligence stored in the satellite’s network or disrupts satellite navigational or communication signals, without directly causing any physical damage. But when it was adopted in the 1970s, the drafters of the\nwith the provisions set forth in the present [t]reaty.” Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

Interpreting the Convention's language as applying to more intangible aggression in space goes directly against the treaty's plain text. Thus, the Liability Convention would not provide a remedy unless interpreted very broadly since any State or non-State actor that hacks a satellite network will almost certainly not be physically launching an object into space. However, the State could still take the responsible party to the ICJ or domestic courts because domestic law is really where most of the regulation on data security and violations of intellectual property exist, subject to the sovereign immunity exceptions, and could succeed in such a claim depending on the nature of the attack and amount of damage caused.\n## IV. SUGGESTIONS FOR REFORM\n## A. Adopting New Treaties or Amending the Current Rules\nIn theory, States could convene to create a new treaty or, at the very least, amend the current treaties to create broader language that is more suitable to addressing intangible cyber threats to satellite systems. For instance, the Liability Convention's requirement of a \"launching State\" does not account for anything other than physical damage caused by another State's launch.[167] However, this seemingly most obvious solution is probably the most unrealistic. First, completing this goal would be a long, arduous process with every State having different interests. Even if it succeeded, by the time a new treaty was adopted, the technology will no doubt out pace any agreement.[168] Additionally, there have been attempts to adopt new space-related treaties that have failed.[169] Amended treaties and additional international legal instruments that provide stronger cybersecurity protections may work temporarily but not long-term and would be met with much resistance.\n\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 435\n## B. International Cooperation and Implementing More Adaptive Standards\nBecause of the inherently global nature of both cyberspace and satellites, international cooperation among States is crucial to set a baseline of international legal norms that protect satellites and satellite communications from cyber interferences. According to Blount, the primary sources that govern space law lack sufficient enforcement mechanisms. Cybersecurity laws are a scattered and inconsistent collection of domestic laws and international norms that States have been slow to adopt. Implementing specific cybersecurity laws at the international level, particularly ones directly aimed at or capable of protecting space assets, could create a false sense of security for a time, until technology changes again, and complying with the law no longer mitigates risk. Although satellite operators will feel pressure to establish cybersecurity practices and standards within international space law, to maximize the Internet security of these satellites, cooperative efforts among States is necessary to protect the networks and avoid potential conflict in outer space.\nPerhaps there is a way to follow Blount’s approach of focusing on international cooperation and implementing adaptable standards in addition to adopting some rigid international legal instruments, or amendments to the current ones, as a long-term goal. The combination of hard legal rules with malleable standards and international cooperation could account both for the need for stricter enforcement and clearer legal rules and address Blount’s concern that technology will outpace the law. If adopting or amending a treaty is currently infeasible, perhaps the UN could impose declarations, principles, or even resolutions that reinterpret the UN Charter’s provisions to account for these new threats that the original drafters did not anticipate. Adopting an international body dedicated to cybersecurity in outer space, similar to COPUOS, could also be a potential solution, simply to bring all the relevant parties to the table to address this vexing problem.\n---\n Blount, *supra* note 65, at 273.\n *Id.* at 293.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe convergence of cyberspace and outer space presents novel questions within space law and international law in general. Both space law and cybersecurity law are new areas, and cybersecurity law has continued to evolve and change with technology while space law has remained relatively stagnant. The novelty of these areas of the law, along with the unique physical nature of space and the intangibility of cyberspace, makes it difficult to determine what sorts of cyber intrusions to space satellite systems violate international law. While there is no clear answer as to how exactly the international legal community should deal with this problem, plenty of authority stemming from traditional international law can be utilized. Additionally, States have several options moving forward to ensure the protection of these highly sensitive space-based systems and provide relief to victims of hacks. Although adopting new international legal instruments, or modifying the current ones, would be the ideal solution, it would be unlikely to garner much support considering the various interests of the various nations. Perhaps this can remain a long-term goal, but in the meantime, States should work cooperatively, with strong support from the private sector, to adopt international legal norms and practices in the form of declarations, principles, resolutions, State practice, and perhaps even the creation of an international body dedicated to the protection of satellite systems, and other Internet-powered space technologies, in outer space.",

In recent years, land-based cyber intrusions, hacks and data breaches, including ones against Equifax, Sony, the Democratic National Committee and the Office of Personnel Management, exposed masses of consumer data and compromised the networks of various private companies and governmental organizations. These significant events caused great harm to the organizations, the economy and the public. Cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for public and private organizations in recent years. However, the issue has not been meaningfully addressed among the international legal community, particularly within the space sector. If a hostile actor were to successfully infiltrate the networks of major satellite systems that orbit the Earth, which the world relies on for, among other things, communication, navigation, weather monitoring, national security and military operations, the consequences could be catastrophic. This Note addresses what sorts of cyber-attacks or intrusions to a satellite system would constitute a violation of international law and to what degree a State can respond and receive reparation for damage, either physical or otherwise, caused. It concludes that the application of currently accepted legal\n* Andrew Fois is a recent graduate of Georgetown University Law Center.

The Note applies the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force, the law of State responsibility, sovereignty and other principles of international law to hypothesize how the current international regime could address such a scenario. It concludes with the suggestion that: 1) the international space law community adopt cooperative and streamlined norms, standards and initiatives that are adaptable to constantly evolving technologies, including the formation of an international body dedicated to cyber issues in outer space that would bring all relevant parties together; and 2) within that framework consider implementing amendments to the space law treaties as a long-term goal.\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nWhen a powerful Soviet satellite armed with electromagnetic pulse weaponry falls into the wrong hands, British intelligence agents had to risk their lives to prevent the space-based weapon from incapacitating electricity-powered technologies on Earth in a destructive blast. While this is the somewhat far-fetched plot of the 1995 James Bond film *Goldeneye*, the film illustrates the importance of artificial space-based satellites and the potential disaster that could result if a hostile actor gained control of one. Although no satellite capable of such mass destruction orbits the Earth currently, various military and civilian observation, communication, weather and navigational satellites, if compromised, could have similarly drastic consequences, particularly as satellite technologies advance and hostile intruders become more sophisticated, especially by utilizing Internet-based attacks.\nThe problem of an artificial satellite becoming compromised due to a cyber intrusion of its network is not completely theoretical. In 2007 and 2008, several United States (US) military satellites were hacked through a ground station in Norway—the Chinese\n See GOLDENEYE (United Artists 1995).\n See William Akoto, *What Happens When All the Tiny Satellites We’re Shooting Into Space Get Hacked?*, FAST COMPANY (Feb. 15, 2020), https://www.fastcompany.com/90464666/what-happens-when-all-the-tiny-satellites-were-shooting-into-space-get-hacked.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nmilitary is the prime suspect. A Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1 satellite, which are used for climate and terrain monitoring by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Geological Survey (USGS), each experienced several minutes of interference. Luckily, no commands were successfully sent to the satellite and no data was captured by the hackers. However, it is concerning that these adversary possibly State hackers managed to infiltrate a highly sensitive network and gain access to the satellites' controls. Attempts did not end there. Another hacking campaign, allegedly by the Chinese again, occurred in 2018 when hackers intruded into the networks of satellite operators of private defense contractors and telecommunications companies. Although the international space community is beginning to consider the consequences of a successful hacking campaign on space technologies, it is only a matter of time before a State, one of its agents, or even an unidentifiable non-State actor successfully infiltrates a crucial commercial or government-owned satellite system and damages, destroys, steals sensitive data or manipulates its transmission.\nSatellites today are capable of a variety of functionality and have highly advanced technological capability. Satellites are relay stations in space that receive voice, data, and video communications signals from multiple military, government, and commercial ground stations across Earth, and are thus vulnerable to internet-\n Jim Wolf, China Key Suspect in U.S. Satellite Hacks: Commission, REUTERS (Oct. 28, 2011), https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-satellite-idUSTRE79R4O320111028.\n Id.\n Id.\n See U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION, 2011 REPORT TO CONGRESS (2011).\n Reuters, China-Based Hacking Campaign Is Said to Have Breached Satellite, Defense Companies, CNBC (June 19, 2018), https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/china-based-hacking-breached-satellite-defense-companies-symantec.html.\n NASA's chief information security officer has stated that preventing hacking of its systems is a top priority for the agency.

Hacking a GPS satellite, for instance, could seriously compromise worldwide travel and communication. Of particular note, cyber-attacks became more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving networks more vulnerable due to the disrupted economy and rise of teleworking. For instance, China may have attempted to hack American vaccine data. Networks can be infiltrated more easily when employees work from home, often from their own personal devices.

Such interferences are disturbing because, while the hackers did not actually exercise control of the satellites in these instances, they achieved all steps required for command and could access satellites with more sensitive functions in the future.

Now more than ever is the time to start taking cybersecurity more seriously.\nA major breach of certain satellite networks by sophisticated actors could have drastic effects, depending on the intentions of the intruder. For instance, the US military uses the USA 224 satellite for detailed spying all around the Earth for military activities. If that satellite were compromised, hackers could acquire invaluable and classified US intelligence, threaten US military operations and perhaps even manipulate the satellite's transmission to complete military objectives adverse to the interests of the US. Similarly, a hacker could also disrupt a geostationary weather satellite, such as the GOES series, causing weather prediction to be disrupted, or one of the many commercial telecommunications satellites that power critical infrastructure. Other disruptions could affect air traffic controls, cable and network television broadcasts, cell-phone communications, military intelligence and environmental monitoring. Current space law would likely never allow the launching of a satellite like Goldeneye with nuclear capabilities specifically designed as an electromagnetic weapon. But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today. It is crucial that the law can account for hackers' ability to use sophisticated and constantly advancing technologies to access\n Geoff Brumfiel, Amateurs Identify U.S. Spy Satellite Behind President Trump's Tweet, NPR (Sept. 2, 2019), https://www.npr.org/2019/09/02/756673481/amateurs-identify-u-s-spy-satellite-behind-president-trumps-tweet.\n See NOAA GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE SERVER (last visited on May 11, 2020), https://www.goes.noaa.gov/.\n What Are Satellites Used For?, UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS (Feb. 13, 2014), https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-are-satellites-used#:~:text=Satellites%20can%20detect%20underground%20water,erosion%20of%20topsoil%20from%20land.\n The Outer Space Treaty, which will be discussed in more detail in later sections, prohibits any nuclear weapons from being placed in Earth's orbit, and, although it does not explicitly prohibit other non-nuclear weapons, a device capable of such destruction would violate the treaty's notional requirement that outer space be used for peaceful purposes. See Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Jan. 27, 1967, 18 U.S.T. 2410, 610 U.N.T.S. 205, arts. II, IV [hereinafter Outer Space Treaty].\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 411\nsatellite networks as well as the fact that more advanced satellites, if breached, could result in severe consequences.\nThe US and the international community at large are not sufficiently prepared to protect against or provide adequate recourse for a larger-scale cyber-attack against the networks of highly valued space satellites on the scope of the alleged Chinese hacks on Equifax and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). In particular, it is unclear exactly how current international law, which is still evolving in both the cyber and space realms, could disincentivize hackers and provide States with sufficient response options or remedies. This question is particularly difficult to answer since there is no clear international framework governing cybersecurity on its own let alone cybersecurity in space. Additionally, the distinctive physical nature of both cyberspace and outer space presents challenges as to how these laws apply. Although the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in outer space, other means of destroying or interfering with a satellite are not directly prohibited by any of the five main treaties governing outer space. However, the major principles drawn from those\n See Brian Barrett, *How 4 Chinese Hackers Allegedly Took Down Equifax*, WIRED (Feb. 10, 2020), https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-hack-china/.\n Although many States have enacted their own domestic cybersecurity laws, there is not much governing such activities on the international plane. See Pavan Duggal, Chairman, Int’l Comm’n on Cyber Security Law, *UNOOSA Presentation: Cyber Security Law, It’s Regulation and Relevance for Outer Space*, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/hf/HLF2017/presentations/Day2/Session_7b/Presentation5.pdf.\n See generally, *ACQNOTES*, https://acqnotes.com/acqnote/careerfields/cyberspace (last visited Jan. 3, 2022).\n Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. IV.\n See Stephens &amp; Blake, *supra* note 12. In addition to the Outer Space Treaty mentioned previously, there are four other relevant treaties for a total of five space law treaties. The Rescue Agreement elaborates on elements of articles V and VIII of the Outer Space Treaty, providing that States take all possible steps to rescue and assist astronauts in distress and promptly return them to the launching State and that States, upon request, assist launching states in recovering space objects outside the launching State’s territory. Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space, Apr. 22, 1968, 19 U.S.T. 7570.\nThe Liability Convention elaborates on article VII of the Outer Space Treaty, providing that a launching State should be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space objects on the surface of Earth or to aircraft and due to activities in space. It also provides procedures for settling claims for damages. Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Mar. 29, 1972, 24 U.S.T. 2389 [hereinafter Liability Convention].\n\ntreaties, along with other areas of international law, such as the law of State responsibility, the United Nations (UN) prohibition against the use of force and principles of sovereignty, may offer some guidance. Despite the recognition of cybersecurity’s importance on outer space technologies by many in the international space community, the current legal framework warrants improvement. A streamlined, cooperative legal approach at the international, domestic and market levels is still needed.\nPart II of this Note discusses the background and history of the space race alongside the emergence of the Internet and how space and nuclear-capable States have developed into major cybersecurity threats against one another. Part III outlines the current international space law and general international law, most relevant to the issue of cyber intrusions against satellites. Part IV addresses specifically how current law can prevent and mitigate the risk of cyber-security breaches of artificial satellites and discusses what international resources and remedies are available if such an event were to occur. It posits that the current international legal framework is insufficient and suggests possible reforms to the law and other cooperative actions that the international space law community should take, including the formation of new UN body\nThe Registration Convention builds upon the Outer Space Treaty, Rescue Agreement, and Liability Convention creates a mechanism to help States identify space objects by expanding the scope of the UN Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space and addressed issues relating to State parties’ responsibilities concerning space objects. Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, Jan. 14, 1975, 28 U.S.T. 695.\nThe Moon Agreement reaffirms and elaborates on many elements of the Outer Space Treaty as applied to the moon and other celestial bodies, providing that those bodies should be used only for peaceful purposes, their environments not disrupted, that the UN should be informed of the location and purpose of any station on those bodies. Additionally, and that the Moon and its natural resources are the common heritage of mankind and that an international regime should be established to govern the exploitation of such resources if exploitation becomes feasible.

BACKGROUND\n## A. The Cold War’s Significance on the Space Race Alongside the Internet’s Development\nThe Cold War solidified the status of Russia, at that time the Soviet Union, and the US as the two primary players in both the space race and the nuclear arms race. Space was linked to nuclear disarmament during this period. After the 1967 launch of Sputnik, the world’s first artificial satellite, into orbit by the Soviet Union, the US and the Soviet Union competed in their space capabilities with various launches and experiments. The US capabilities demonstrably surpassed the Soviets with Apollo 8 orbiting the Moon and Apollo 11 putting humans on the Moon at the end of the decade. In fact, the Moon landing may even have been a catalyst to the end of the Cold War and the cementing of the US’s advantage over the Soviets in the nuclear arms and space races. Notably, the same technology used to launch Sputnik into space was intended by the Soviets as a way to deliver intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBMs).\nAt the same time, the Internet was developed largely as a reaction to the events of the Cold War. The US military created\n See Bradley G. Shreve, *The US, the USSR, and Space Exploration, 1957-1963*, 20 INT’L J.

During the height of the Cold War, the US military further developed this network to communicate faster in the event of a nuclear attack. Eventually, this technology evolved into the Internet the world knows today.\nBefore long, the Internet was subject to various vulnerabilities in its network. The first computer virus was discovered in 1971 during the ARPANET age. By 1983, the US filed its first patent for cybersecurity protection to prevent these intrusions. Beginning in the early 2000s, State and non-State hackers became more organized and sophisticated. For instance, Anonymous, the first major hacker group, committed various attacks against governmental organizations and corporations, mainly in the name of privacy. By the 2010s, the US began to identify even more sophisticated security breaches committed by State-sponsored intelligence operatives for the first time. Today, cybersecurity is a major concern for individuals, governments and corporations as organizations rely almost exclusively on Internet-capable technologies. Most organizations today have information technology departments, a chief information officer (CIO), specific policies and technical measures to prevent and respond to cyber incidents or attacks and even a team of employees dedicated to cybersecurity prevention and response.\n Ben Tarnoff, *How the Internet Was Invented*, THE GUARDIAN (July 15, 2016), https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf.\n Spencer Bruttig &amp; Matt Gregory, *Here’s How the Cold War Helped Create the Internet We Know and Love Today*, WUSA9 (Dec. 6, 2019), https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/this-week-in-history-how-the-internet-was-created-during-the-cold-war/507-41b19bed-f500-4d66-a565-c72de578a7d0.\n Tim Matthew, *A Brief History of Cybersecurity*, CYBERSECURITY INSIDERS (last visited March 2, 2020), https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/a-brief-history-of-cybersecurity/.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.

In the US, for instance, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the main entity in charge of ensuring that government agencies have adequate standards and security policies in place and follow the government-sponsored guidance while the National Security Agency (NSA) has developed its own cyber-attack methods for responding to and hacking into the networks of adversary States. Certain States are notorious for cyber-attacks, whether government-sponsored or not, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Israel, the United Kingdom and even the United States. China, in particular, is responsible for 29.56% of denial of service attacks.\n## B.

But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today, so it is crucial that space law can account for the fact that evolving technologies create new ways for hackers to access these systems. Today, most devices, including satellites, rely on the Internet, and with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), that will only increase.\nHistory shows that satellites are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which scholar P. J. Blount argues are merely one form of IoT, and given the rise of military activities in outer space and military cyber espionage and attacks, there is no reason to doubt that a State or nonaligned hacker group may attempt to infiltrate and\nand stealing trade secrets and highly personal data from millions of Americans.

The Chinese have already been suspected of successfully gained access to the Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1. The Pentagon has also reported that both the Chinese and Russians are developing lasers and a host of other anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, which could track, study, or even target adversary satellites through physical, kinetic, microwave and cyber technologies. This Pentagon report also apparently indicated that the Chinese and Russians are preparing to employ offensive and defensive ASAT technology, which could extend to cyber infiltration of satellites as well.\nBlount argues that it is only a matter of time before military conflict occurs in outer space. He notes that although China and the US have developed ASAT technologies, no legal instrument has been adopted to regulate them. Blount goes on to suggest that the rules of armed conflict from international humanitarian law should extend to military activities in space. Blount’s ideas serve as a useful starting point in examining what sorts of international rules could be adopted to effectively regulate and prevent cyber attacks against satellites.\n## II. CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REGIME\nBoth international law in general and international space law in particular provide legal protections to both States and private satellite operators to ensure the security of their satellites in space. Because there are only five treaties governing space activities specifically, much of the law applicable to cybersecurity of satellites comes from general public international law, which the Outer Space Treaty says governs outer space activities as well.\n See Wolf, supra note 3.\n These ASATs may employ microwave, radiofrequency jamming, laser, chemical spraying, kinetic kill and robotic technologies to attack satellites.

III.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 419\nAdditionally, the nature of cyberspace, because it is intangible, presents many challenges that traditional international law does not address. Due to its infancy, even more so than space exploration, there is no clear standard of international legal norms in the area of cybersecurity. Rather, there are mostly theories and suggestions as to how the traditional rules and principles apply in this new domain.\nAccording to Article 38 of the Statute governing the International Court of Justice (ICJ), public international law consists of three primary sources: (1) international conventions, (2) international custom, as evidence of general practice accepted as law and (3) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations. In addition, judicial decisions and the “teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations” may serve as subsidiary sources. Finally, there are various other sources of soft law, such as memoranda of understanding, recommendations, principles and resolutions, which lack the same enforcement measures of “hard law” but serve as useful persuasive authority. These subsidiary sources are particularly useful in space law considering the field’s infancy, even more so compared to space law due to the recent advance of computer technology, and lack of internationally binding legal instruments.\n## A. Treaties\n### i. The Outer Space Treaty\nThe foundational international convention governing space activities is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. According to the Treaty, all space activities should be carried out in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, in the interest of maintaining peace, security, cooperation and understanding, and States should act with “due regard” to the interests of all other parties to\n See Duggal, supra note 22.\n Statute of the International Court of Justice Art. 38 June 26 1945, 6 L.N.T.S. 391-413.\n Id. at art. 38.4\n See Francis Lyall &amp; Paul B. Larsen, Space Law: A Treatise 47-48 (Routledge ed., 2d ed. 2018).\n Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20.\n\nthe treaty. Thus, treaties, custom and other sources of general international law also govern outer space activities.\nAdditionally, the placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in space is prohibited. However, nothing in the treaty addresses non-nuclear space weapons explicitly, though Article IV says that the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used only for peaceful purposes, but launching other types of weapons into space, depending on the purpose and capability of destruction, could go against the Treaty’s overall object and purpose of maintaining peace and security. Nevertheless, the Treaty does not explicitly prohibit non-physical threats, such as cyber intrusions.\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides for some redress for violations of international law. States who conduct national activities in outer space bear “international responsibility” for such activities but are only “liable” for physical damage caused by space objects they launch into outer space whereas the Liability Convention expands in more detail on when a State actually must pay for damages.\n## ii. The Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention provides that States should pay for damage caused by objects the State launches into outer space. Liability should be distinguished from “international responsibility.” Specifically, it states that “[a] launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.” If damage is caused elsewhere, the launching State “shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” But the Convention defines “damage” as death,\n---\n *Id.* at arts.

The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter, the foundational treaty of the United Nations (UN), governs outer space activities per Article III of the Outer Space Treaty.84 The Charter, among many other things, prohibits the use of force and requires States to resolve disputes by peaceful means unless the UN approves the use of force by resolution or the State uses force in self-defense.85 These principles raise the question of whether hacking, jamming or interfering with satellites through cyberspace constitutes a use of force because it is not necessarily an “armed” attack in the traditional sense.86\niv. Budapest Convention on Cybercrime\nAlthough many US states have domestic privacy and data security laws,87 there is no real international standard regarding how\n\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nnation-States should handle cyber-security attacks. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is the first and only international convention that specifically seeks to address Internet crime. The treaty attempts to harmonize the laws addressing copyright infringement, computer fraud, child pornography and violations of network security. However, it only has sixty-seven signatories, and its scope is narrow. Despite the original intention that the Convention apply globally, the US only ratified it in 2006, while various States that hold strong nationalism and sovereignty views, such as Russia, unsurprisingly, oppose it. It has garnered little recognition and significance since its adoption.\n## B. Custom\n## i.

State practice on this principle can be seen in various treaties, statements, principles and policies from space-capable nations. There is even a body in the UN dedicated to maintaining peace, security and development in outer space—the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPOUS)—as well as a legal subcommittee. However, defining what “peaceful purposes” actually means can be difficult, especially when considering the intangible nature of cyberspace.\n## ii. Violating Another State’s Sovereignty\nStates can violate international law by interfering with another State’s sovereignty or territorial integrity. Territorial sovereignty means that a State exercises complete and exclusive jurisdiction over its physical territory. The ICJ has stressed that “respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.” Traditionally, whether a State violated another State’s sovereignty could easily be determined because it was dependent on physical borders. However, determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation can be difficult in the space and cyber context due to its cross-border nature and the fact that a hack might not actually occur in outer space but rather through servers on Earth.\n## iii.

States who commit an internationally wrongful act, either through a State organ or by an entity under the instruction or control of the State, owe reparations to the injured party. An injured State may also respond with countermeasures that are proportional to the original violation and are necessary to stop, prevent, or remedy the violation, subject to the limitations of the UN Charter. However, the perpetrators of many cyber-attacks cannot even be identified, let alone officially attributed to a State, and thus a State cannot be held internationally responsible. While there is little authority on State attribution in the cyber context, the *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* serves as a useful reference guide on the current State of customary international law, particularly on this topic.\n## C. Subsidiary Sources and Soft Law\nIn addition to treaties and customary international law, subsidiary sources can be a useful, additional authority. These could include opinions from the ICJ on general subjects of international law. Given the novelty of cyberattacks on space assets, scholarly commentary are also useful sources, especially considering the lack of established binding legal authority in this area. Additionally, Unite Nations principles, declarations and resolutions serve as useful “soft law” that do not have the same binding effect as treaties and other primary sources of international law. They are indicative, however, of State practice and international consensus.\n---\n See DRAFT ARTICLES ON RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS WITH COMMENTARY ARTS. 2, 4, 8, INT’L LAW COMM’N 2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf ([hereinafter DRAFT ARTICLES].\n *Id.*\n See *id.* § 905.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL 2.0 *supra* note 88.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 425\n## III. HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN PREVENT AND PROVIDE REDRESS FOR A MAJOR CYBER-ATTACK ON A SATELLITE SYSTEM\nA successful cyber-attack on a satellite could interfere with the space object’s flight control, payload control or transmission. Because the Outer Space Treaty says that space activities are governed by international law, if such an attack were to occur, the State or private company whose satellite was compromised would turn to international law to evaluate its response options and any potential recourse the attacker owes. The injured satellite operator will want assurances and effective enforcement measures from the law that discourage and disincentivize hostile actors from committing attacks.\n### A. Prevention and Risk Mitigation: How Hacking Satellites Violates International Law\nThe space law treaties say little specifically about how States can prevent against possible cyber military or terrorist attacks in space but are more concerned with the peaceful use and exploration of outer space for the “province of all [hu]mankind.” However, there are various ways that general international law can be violated when a hacker invades a government or private satellite’s network.\nFirst, a cyber-attack, depending on its nature and scope, could qualify as a violation of international law because it is a prohibited “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Second, a cyber-attack may constitute a violation of a State’s territorial\n---\n See Elizabeth Howell, *What Is A Satellite?*, SPACE.COM (Oct. 27, 2017), https://www.space.com/24839-satellites.html.\n Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. III.\n *Id.* at art. I.\n See UN Charter art. 2(4). For instance, a hacker State could use prohibited force against another State directly by interfering with its weather or Internet communications, causing technology failures, transportation shutdowns, or emergency responses that would likely cause significant physical damage. This type of hack would more clearly qualify as a use of force because it resulted in physical damage, even if the hacker was not using armed force in the traditional sense. Alternatively, a more indirect use of force could be economic in nature, such as collapsing a State’s stock exchange system or financial institutions, which would be more difficult to show as a violation of the UN Charter.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsovereignty. But whether a violation of international law actually occurs will be highly context specific.\ni. Cyber-Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite’s Network As a “Use of Force” Prohibited by the United Nations Charter\nWhether the UN’s prohibition against the use of force, and exception for self-defense measures, applies to cyberspace is generally unresolved by international law and highly dependent on each State’s particular interpretation of the Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter says that States may use force in self-defense or in anticipation of an impending attack “if an armed attack occurs.” Although cyber activities are not “armed” in the traditional sense, a successful cyber operation against a satellite system could qualify as an armed attack under international law depending on the circumstances of the attack. The theory accepted by most States on Article 2(4)’s applicability in cyberspace argues that an attack may be deemed “armed” if its scope and effect are equivalent to that of a\n A cyber-attack that crosses State borders, unlike traditional violations of territorial sovereignty, is more difficult to determine because of the intangible nature of cyberspace. If a hacker caused massive amounts of damage to another State across the globe, without ever actually setting foot in that State, it would be difficult to argue that the hacker violated traditional principles of sovereignty, which focuses on a State’s exclusive jurisdiction over physical territory. See supra note 100.\n UN Charter arts. 2(4); see also art. 51 (permitting States to use force in self defense against an armed attack).\n See Benedikt Pirker, supra note 99.\n Id. Depending on the target, extent of damage, intentions of the attacker, and a variety of other factual circumstances, a cyber attack may or may not qualify as a “use of force” under the UN Charter. While hackers generally are not “armed” in the traditional sense of having physical weapons, they could cause massive damage to variety of information and communications systems through malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, zero-day exploits, or domain name system (DNS) tunnelling. See What is a Cyberattack? CISCO (last visited Sept. 6, 2022), https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html#-types-of-cyber-attacks.\nFor instance, a malware attack, commonly understood as a cyber-attack using malicious software to breach a network vulnerability and block access, install harmful software, steal data, or render the system inoperable, that shut down aviation systems could qualify as a prohibited use of force because it would cause massive damage to a State’s transportation infrastructure and was clearly intended to disrupt those communication systems. See id. By contrast, a man-in-the middle attack that merely eavesdrops and obtains information from an important government transaction may be damaging and potentially illegal, but would be less likely to qualify as a use of force under the UN Charter. See id.; UN Charter art. 2(4).\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 427\nphysical attack. Other theories take a more holistic view and consider various factors such as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legality. This section focuses on the “effects” test, as it is the test followed by most States and the US.\nUnder the “effects” test, a hacker that intentionally causes physical damage to a satellite will have violated the UN’s prohibition on force and thus committed an internationally wrongful act. The US in particular considers “clandestine” military operations conducted in cyberspace to be traditional military activity. For instance, if Chinese military operatives were to intentionally invade a US military satellite network to destroy it or cause it to collide into another satellite in space, this conduct would violate the UN Charter’s prohibition under the US interpretation because the operatives have caused clear tangible damage to US military assets.\nHowever, if the cyber intrusion causes more of an economic or dignitary harm, such as information theft, that does not have a direct physical effect, delineating between permissible and prohibited acts under international law becomes less clear. The ICJ has ruled on drawing this line in *Nicaragua v. United States* when it found that the US merely funding Nicaraguan guerillas who opposed their government did not use prohibited force against the State. The US did use force, however, when it armed and trained those forces, even without any immediate physical effects. This case suggests that some additional, and intentional, steps must be taken by hackers beyond mere access for an intrusion to constitute a prohibited use of force under the effects test. So, if Chinese military operatives only gained access to a satellite communications system merely to infiltrate the system, as they allegedly did in 2007 and\n This theory is referred to as the “effects” test.

Cyber Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite's Network as a Violation of a State's Territorial Sovereignty\nA State can also violate international law with a cyber intrusion if it interferes with another State's sovereignty or territorial integrity. Like with the UN prohibition against the use of force, drawing the line between legal conduct and an illegal violation of State sovereignty can be murky. In the Corfu Channel Case, for instance, the ICJ found that the United Kingdom (UK) did not violate Albania's sovereignty when its warships passed through Albanian waters during World War II without permission from the government but did when it went back into the waters to conduct minesweeping operations later on. While some amount of coercion will not amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty, when an interference crosses the line to become a prohibited intervention, this will violate international law. In the cyber context, a minor interference, such as the alleged Chinese interference in 2007 and 2008, that causes little or no disturbance or damage, would likely not qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty because it is more akin to \"passing through.\" But, at certain point, a cyber interference could become a sovereignty violation when it rises to the level of the minesweeping activity in the Corfu Channel Case. Following the reasoning of this case, a State who infiltrates a satellite system merely to \"pass through\" would likely not violate international law. But taking data, damaging the satellite, or manipulating its transmission would be more akin to \"minesweeping\" and thus a\n See Wolf, supra note 3.\n Id.\n See Pirker, supra note 99, at 192.\n Id.\n U.K. v.

Unlike a channel of water that clearly sits within a State’s physical borders, cyberspace, like outer space, has been argued to be a “global commons.” A global commons is an area located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any particular State to which all nations have access. The Outer Space Treaty suggests that outer space is a global commons when it calls it the province of all of humankind. However, cyberspace, unlike outer space, more suitably falls under the sovereign jurisdiction of individual States. For one, cyberspace is run by physical servers and modems, and when a virus is transmitted to a network, it can be traced to a physical source. Additionally, States can prevent others from accessing their content outside of the country because they have their own Internet regulators, filters and IP addresses. By contrast, outer space still exists within physical space and is not subject to the same constraints and regulation as the Internet.

Although the US has not officially recognized outer space as a global commons, there is an argument for deeming it one due to the language in the treaty.

Satellites, however, are still owned and operated by States and private companies that own and operate facilities on Earth. Hackers will generally invade the physical server located on Earth that will then send signals and commands to the space-based object. So, even if satellites were not subject to national appropriation once launched into outer space, most hacking occurs on the Earth. Additionally, even if a hacker attacked a satellite in space directly, such as through an ASAT weapon, the satellite is the property of the State or private company. While space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation, property launched into space is. Thus, a major cyber-attack against a State or privately-owned satellite would likely be deemed a violation of State sovereignty, presuming it qualifies as more than just \"passing through.\"\n## B. State Response and Redress\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides that States should bear international responsibility, distinguished from liability, for national activities in outer space. The law of State responsibility governs how States may respond to acts of aggression under international law. However, there are often rogue hackers whose actions cannot be attributable to a State government. Likewise, the Liability Convention expands on the Outer Space Treaty, providing a special framework for State liability for damage that a State causes object. Because this Convention was adopted before the existence of the Internet and when only a few States conducted activities in\n Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

However, a hostile actor who damages a satellite system through cyberspace, even if associated with the State itself, will rarely be launching anything, and even if it were, it is not a space object causing damage but a computer virus or malware.\ni. Determining International Responsibility and Response Options\nIf a State violates international law, either directly or through its organs or agents, it generally must make reparation through restitution for the loss or injury and may be responded against by the injured State. Even if the source of a virus or malware can be traced to the territory of a particular State, the hack could have been orchestrated by a rogue actor unassociated with the government. If so, public international law provides little recourse, and the affected party must seek alternative relief. Often, a State is only suspected of sponsoring a cyberattack or is not even involved at all. For instance, in the OPM hack, the US government traced the source of the data breach to Chinese nationals but could not formally link them to the government, at least at first. In this particular case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later charged four members of the Chinese military with the hack and explicitly tied the attack to Beijing. This case is an outlier because the US was very close to eventually being able to attribute the hackers to the Chinese government, though could not do so definitively, but in many cases, attribution to the State or even\n See Stefan A. Kaiser &amp; Martha Mejía-Kaiser, Cyber Security in Air and Space Law, 64 Z.L.W. 396, 406-07 (2015).\n A State may still be internationally responsible if it does not act directly but directs or controls other actors. See DRAFT ARTICLES, supra note 103, arts. 2, 4, 8.\n See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS §§ 901, 905.\n “While no ‘smoking gun’ was found linking the attack to a specific perpetrator, the overwhelming consensus is that OPM was hacked by State-sponsored attackers working for the Chinese government. See Josh Fruhlinger, The OPM Hack Explained: Bad Security Practices Meet China’s Captain America, CSO (Feb. 12, 2020), https://www.csoonline.com/article/3318238/the-opm-hack-explained-bad-security-practices-meet-chinas-captain-america.html.\n But the US rarely files criminal charges against foreign intelligence officers for fear of retaliation. Id.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsuspected attribution cannot be determined at all because the hackers cannot be found or have no provable links to the government.\nAttributing a cyberattack to a State can be a difficult process. First, identifying hackers can be technically challenging because they use third-party proxies and other concealment tools to mask their activities. Additionally, international law lacks streamlined norms regarding cyberactivity, which makes formal attribution impractical. According to Tallinn 2.0, “[c]yber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” In addition, a State is responsible for intentionally aiding or assisting, directing or controlling, or coercing another State to violate international law. But this has proved difficult to show. For instance, officials suspected that those responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016 were linked to the Russian government, but it was not until the end of the year, after the election of President Trump, that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency formally declared that the Russian government interfered with the election, after almost a year of research, intelligence gathering and reporting. Presumably, hackers who could infiltrate a highly secure satellite network will have to be pretty sophisticated, making it easier to hide their tracks. Thus, the rise of unidentifiable hackers or those with weak ties to State governments makes attribution less likely.\nAssuming that a cyberattack can be attributed to a State, and that that attack was a violation of international law, the Outer Space Treaty provides guidance as to what recourse and remedies are available to States after an attack has occurred. In certain\n Id.\n See William Banks, State Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0, 95 TEX. L.

In the cyber context, this could include a retaliatory cyberattack, economic sanctions, or, if serious enough, the use of physical force. The US policy, for instance, under the Trump administration, was to meet any harmful interference of space assets in cyberspace “with a deliberate response at a time, place, manner, and domain of our choosing.” International law will permit such a response if it is proportional to the initial hostile act.\n## ii. State Liability for Damage Caused by a Cyber Attack\nA cyberattack could compromise a satellite by causing clear physical damage or indirect damage to the satellite operator’s economic, informational, or intellectual property assets. It is much easier for a State to recover for physical damage because it can simply sue for damage to property. The Liability Convention, however, only provides recourse for damage caused by space objects by the “launching State.” A State whose agents attack another State’s satellite networks via the Internet is not necessarily launching a space object as the Convention requires. The Convention provides liability in a narrow set of circumstances. An intrusion may be just as damaging but only cause intellectual property or economic damage, such as when the hacker takes military intelligence stored in the satellite’s network or disrupts satellite navigational or communication signals, without directly causing any physical damage.

Interpreting the Convention's language as applying to more intangible aggression in space goes directly against the treaty's plain text. Thus, the Liability Convention would not provide a remedy unless interpreted very broadly since any State or non-State actor that hacks a satellite network will almost certainly not be physically launching an object into space. However, the State could still take the responsible party to the ICJ or domestic courts because domestic law is really where most of the regulation on data security and violations of intellectual property exist, subject to the sovereign immunity exceptions, and could succeed in such a claim depending on the nature of the attack and amount of damage caused.\n## IV. SUGGESTIONS FOR REFORM\n## A. Adopting New Treaties or Amending the Current Rules\nIn theory, States could convene to create a new treaty or, at the very least, amend the current treaties to create broader language that is more suitable to addressing intangible cyber threats to satellite systems. For instance, the Liability Convention's requirement of a \"launching State\" does not account for anything other than physical damage caused by another State's launch.[167] However, this seemingly most obvious solution is probably the most unrealistic. First, completing this goal would be a long, arduous process with every State having different interests. Even if it succeeded, by the time a new treaty was adopted, the technology will no doubt out pace any agreement.[168] Additionally, there have been attempts to adopt new space-related treaties that have failed.[169] Amended treaties and additional international legal instruments that provide stronger cybersecurity protections may work temporarily but not long-term and would be met with much resistance.\n\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 435\n## B. International Cooperation and Implementing More Adaptive Standards\nBecause of the inherently global nature of both cyberspace and satellites, international cooperation among States is crucial to set a baseline of international legal norms that protect satellites and satellite communications from cyber interferences. According to Blount, the primary sources that govern space law lack sufficient enforcement mechanisms. Cybersecurity laws are a scattered and inconsistent collection of domestic laws and international norms that States have been slow to adopt. Implementing specific cybersecurity laws at the international level, particularly ones directly aimed at or capable of protecting space assets, could create a false sense of security for a time, until technology changes again, and complying with the law no longer mitigates risk. Although satellite operators will feel pressure to establish cybersecurity practices and standards within international space law, to maximize the Internet security of these satellites, cooperative efforts among States is necessary to protect the networks and avoid potential conflict in outer space.\nPerhaps there is a way to follow Blount’s approach of focusing on international cooperation and implementing adaptable standards in addition to adopting some rigid international legal instruments, or amendments to the current ones, as a long-term goal. The combination of hard legal rules with malleable standards and international cooperation could account both for the need for stricter enforcement and clearer legal rules and address Blount’s concern that technology will outpace the law. If adopting or amending a treaty is currently infeasible, perhaps the UN could impose declarations, principles, or even resolutions that reinterpret the UN Charter’s provisions to account for these new threats that the original drafters did not anticipate. Adopting an international body dedicated to cybersecurity in outer space, similar to COPUOS, could also be a potential solution, simply to bring all the relevant parties to the table to address this vexing problem.\n---\n Blount, *supra* note 65, at 273.\n *Id.* at 293.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe convergence of cyberspace and outer space presents novel questions within space law and international law in general. Both space law and cybersecurity law are new areas, and cybersecurity law has continued to evolve and change with technology while space law has remained relatively stagnant. The novelty of these areas of the law, along with the unique physical nature of space and the intangibility of cyberspace, makes it difficult to determine what sorts of cyber intrusions to space satellite systems violate international law. While there is no clear answer as to how exactly the international legal community should deal with this problem, plenty of authority stemming from traditional international law can be utilized. Additionally, States have several options moving forward to ensure the protection of these highly sensitive space-based systems and provide relief to victims of hacks. Although adopting new international legal instruments, or modifying the current ones, would be the ideal solution, it would be unlikely to garner much support considering the various interests of the various nations. Perhaps this can remain a long-term goal, but in the meantime, States should work cooperatively, with strong support from the private sector, to adopt international legal norms and practices in the form of declarations, principles, resolutions, State practice, and perhaps even the creation of an international body dedicated to the protection of satellite systems, and other Internet-powered space technologies, in outer space."

In recent years, land-based cyber intrusions, hacks and data breaches, including ones against Equifax, Sony, the Democratic National Committee and the Office of Personnel Management, exposed masses of consumer data and compromised the networks of various private companies and governmental organizations. These significant events caused great harm to the organizations, the economy and the public. Cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for public and private organizations in recent years. However, the issue has not been meaningfully addressed among the international legal community, particularly within the space sector. If a hostile actor were to successfully infiltrate the networks of major satellite systems that orbit the Earth, which the world relies on for, among other things, communication, navigation, weather monitoring, national security and military operations, the consequences could be catastrophic. This Note addresses what sorts of cyber-attacks or intrusions to a satellite system would constitute a violation of international law and to what degree a State can respond and receive reparation for damage, either physical or otherwise, caused.

The Note applies the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force, the law of State responsibility, sovereignty and other principles of international law to hypothesize how the current international regime could address such a scenario. It concludes with the suggestion that: 1) the international space law community adopt cooperative and streamlined norms, standards and initiatives that are adaptable to constantly evolving technologies, including the formation of an international body dedicated to cyber issues in outer space that would bring all relevant parties together; and 2) within that framework consider implementing amendments to the space law treaties as a long-term goal.\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nWhen a powerful Soviet satellite armed with electromagnetic pulse weaponry falls into the wrong hands, British intelligence agents had to risk their lives to prevent the space-based weapon from incapacitating electricity-powered technologies on Earth in a destructive blast.¹ While this is the somewhat far-fetched plot of the 1995 James Bond film *Goldeneye*, the film illustrates the importance of artificial space-based satellites and the potential disaster that could result if a hostile actor gained control of one. Although no satellite capable of such mass destruction orbits the Earth currently, various military and civilian observation, communication, weather and navigational satellites, if compromised, could have similarly drastic consequences, particularly as satellite technologies advance and hostile intruders become more sophisticated, especially by utilizing Internet-based attacks.²\nThe problem of an artificial satellite becoming compromised due to a cyber intrusion of its network is not completely theoretical. In 2007 and 2008, several United States (US) military satellites were hacked through a ground station in Norway—the Chinese\n¹ See GOLDENEYE (United Artists 1995).\n² See William Akoto, *What Happens When All the Tiny Satellites We’re Shooting Into Space Get Hacked?*, FAST COMPANY (Feb. 15, 2020), https://www.fastcompany.com/90464666/what-happens-when-all-the-tiny-satellites-were-shooting-into-space-get-hacked.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nmilitary is the prime suspect.³ A Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1 satellite, which are used for climate and terrain monitoring by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Geological Survey (USGS), each experienced several minutes of interference.⁴ Luckily, no commands were successfully sent to the satellite and no data was captured by the hackers.⁵ However, it is concerning that these adversary possibly State hackers managed to infiltrate a highly sensitive network and gain access to the satellites' controls.⁶ Attempts did not end there. Another hacking campaign, allegedly by the Chinese again, occurred in 2018 when hackers intruded into the networks of satellite operators of private defense contractors and telecommunications companies.⁷ Although the international space community is beginning to consider the consequences of a successful hacking campaign on space technologies,⁸ it is only a matter of time before a State, one of its agents, or even an unidentifiable non-State actor successfully infiltrates a crucial commercial or government-owned satellite system and damages, destroys, steals sensitive data or manipulates its transmission.\nSatellites today are capable of a variety of functionality and have highly advanced technological capability.

Of particular note, cyber-attacks became more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving networks more vulnerable due to the disrupted economy and rise of teleworking.¹⁵ For instance, China may have attempted to hack American vaccine data.¹⁶ Networks can be infiltrated more easily when employees work from home, often from their own personal devices.

Now more than ever is the time to start taking cybersecurity more seriously.\nA major breach of certain satellite networks by sophisticated actors could have drastic effects, depending on the intentions of the intruder. For instance, the US military uses the USA 224 satellite for detailed spying all around the Earth for military activities.¹⁷ If that satellite were compromised, hackers could acquire invaluable and classified US intelligence, threaten US military operations and perhaps even manipulate the satellite's transmission to complete military objectives adverse to the interests of the US. Similarly, a hacker could also disrupt a geostationary weather satellite, such as the GOES series,¹⁸ causing weather prediction to be disrupted, or one of the many commercial telecommunications satellites that power critical infrastructure. Other disruptions could affect air traffic controls, cable and network television broadcasts, cell-phone communications, military intelligence and environmental monitoring.¹⁹ Current space law would likely never allow the launching of a satellite like Goldeneye with nuclear capabilities specifically designed as an electromagnetic weapon.²⁰ But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today.

This question is particularly difficult to answer since there is no clear international framework governing cybersecurity on its own let alone cybersecurity in space.²² Additionally, the distinctive physical nature of both cyberspace and outer space presents challenges as to how these laws apply.²³ Although the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in outer space,²⁴ other means of destroying or interfering with a satellite are not directly prohibited by any of the five main treaties governing outer space.²⁵ However, the major principles drawn from those\n²¹ See Brian Barrett, *How 4 Chinese Hackers Allegedly Took Down Equifax*, WIRED (Feb. 10, 2020), https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-hack-china/.\n²² Although many States have enacted their own domestic cybersecurity laws, there is not much governing such activities on the international plane.

BACKGROUND\n## A. The Cold War’s Significance on the Space Race Alongside the Internet’s Development\nThe Cold War solidified the status of Russia, at that time the Soviet Union, and the US as the two primary players in both the space race and the nuclear arms race.³¹ Space was linked to nuclear disarmament during this period.³² After the 1967 launch of Sputnik, the world’s first artificial satellite, into orbit by the Soviet Union, the US and the Soviet Union competed in their space capabilities with various launches and experiments. The US capabilities demonstrably surpassed the Soviets with Apollo 8 orbiting the Moon and Apollo 11 putting humans on the Moon at the end of the decade.³³ In fact, the Moon landing may even have been a catalyst to the end of the Cold War and the cementing of the US’s advantage over the Soviets in the nuclear arms and space races.³⁴ Notably, the same technology used to launch Sputnik into space was intended by the Soviets as a way to deliver intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBMs).³⁵\nAt the same time, the Internet was developed largely as a reaction to the events of the Cold War.³⁶ The US military created\n³¹ See Bradley G.

The first computer virus was discovered in 1971 during the ARPANET age.³⁹ By 1983, the US filed its first patent for cybersecurity protection to prevent these intrusions.⁴⁰ Beginning in the early 2000s, State and non-State hackers became more organized and sophisticated. For instance, Anonymous, the first major hacker group, committed various attacks against governmental organizations and corporations, mainly in the name of privacy.⁴¹ By the 2010s, the US began to identify even more sophisticated security breaches committed by State-sponsored intelligence operatives for the first time.⁴² Today, cybersecurity is a major concern for individuals, governments and corporations as organizations rely almost exclusively on Internet-capable technologies. Most organizations today have information technology departments, a chief information officer (CIO), specific policies and technical measures to prevent and respond to cyber incidents or attacks and even a team of employees dedicated to cybersecurity prevention and response.⁴³\n³⁷ Ben Tarnoff, *How the Internet Was Invented*, THE GUARDIAN (July 15, 2016), https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf.\n³⁸ Spencer Bruttig &amp; Matt Gregory, *Here’s How the Cold War Helped Create the Internet We Know and Love Today*, WUSA9 (Dec. 6, 2019), https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/this-week-in-history-how-the-internet-was-created-during-the-cold-war/507-41b19bed-f500-4d66-a565-c72de578a7d0.\n³⁹ Tim Matthew, *A Brief History of Cybersecurity*, CYBERSECURITY INSIDERS (last visited March 2, 2020), https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/a-brief-history-of-cybersecurity/.\n⁴⁰ Id.\n⁴¹ Id.\n⁴² Id.

SpaceX, for instance, plans to launch 12,000 small satellites into space to as part of the Starlink Internet project.⁵¹ Today there are more than 2,000 satellites in orbit, a number which will only increase in the future.⁵² All of them serve as potential targets for cyberattack by State militaries or other hacker groups.\nStates known to have developed cyber capabilities that have attacked the US in the past, such as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, or sophisticated non-State cyber hackers, pose significant threats to these space assets. For instance, in 2011, Sony Pictures was victim to a brutal cyber-attack by a North Korean national suspected to have ties with the government that brought the company to its knees to prevent the release of The Interview, a film that depicted the assassination of Kim Jong-Un, the country's dictator.⁵³ Russian hackers also allegedly infiltrated the network of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and are suspected of having influenced the US 2016 Presidential Election by compromising the American election infrastructure.⁵⁴ The Chinese are arguably the most notorious cyber hackers and are, or are suspected of having been, behind some of the largest cyber-attacks in the past decade, such as the Equifax and OPM breaches.⁵⁵ They also allegedly have\n⁴⁹ Johnny Wood, The Countries with the Most Satellites in Space, WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (Mar. 4, 2019), https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/chart-of-the-day-the-countries-with-the-most-satellites-in-space/.\n⁵⁰ Space.com Staff, North Korea Successfully Launches Satellite Reports, SPACE.COM (Dec. 12, 2012), https://www.space.com/18867-north-korea-rocket-launch-satellite.html.\n⁵¹ Starlink is a satellite network that SpaceX plans to develop into a mega-constellation to provide low-cost Internet to remote locations.

If State and non-State actors⁵⁷ are capable of such major hacks on Earth-based systems, there is little stopping them from targeting satellites in space via the Internet.\nCurrent space law does not allow the placement of nuclear weapons or a weapon of mass destruction such as Goldeneye into orbit.⁵⁸ But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today, so it is crucial that space law can account for the fact that evolving technologies create new ways for hackers to access these systems. Today, most devices, including satellites, rely on the Internet, and with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), that will only increase.\nHistory shows that satellites are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which scholar P. J. Blount argues are merely one form of IoT,⁵⁹ and given the rise of military activities in outer space⁶⁰ and military cyber espionage and attacks,⁶¹ there is no reason to doubt that a State or nonaligned hacker group may attempt to infiltrate and\nand stealing trade secrets and highly personal data from millions of Americans.

Although there is not conclusive proof, the indictment suggests the hack was part of a series of major data thefts organized by the People's Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence agencies. See id.\nAnother such major data theft suspected to have been organized by China was the 2015 data breach against OPM, which resulted in the arrest of a Chinese national by the FBI in 2017.

The Chinese have already been suspected of successfully gained access to the Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1.⁶² The Pentagon has also reported that both the Chinese and Russians are developing lasers and a host of other anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, which could track, study, or even target adversary satellites through physical, kinetic, microwave and cyber technologies.⁶³ This Pentagon report also apparently indicated that the Chinese and Russians are preparing to employ offensive and defensive ASAT technology, which could extend to cyber infiltration of satellites as well.⁶⁴\nBlount argues that it is only a matter of time before military conflict occurs in outer space.⁶⁵ He notes that although China and the US have developed ASAT technologies, no legal instrument has been adopted to regulate them.⁶⁶ Blount goes on to suggest that the rules of armed conflict from international humanitarian law should extend to military activities in space.⁶⁷ Blount’s ideas serve as a useful starting point in examining what sorts of international rules could be adopted to effectively regulate and prevent cyber attacks against satellites.\n## II. CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REGIME\nBoth international law in general and international space law in particular provide legal protections to both States and private satellite operators to ensure the security of their satellites in space. Because there are only five treaties⁶⁸ governing space activities specifically, much of the law applicable to cybersecurity of satellites comes from general public international law, which the Outer Space Treaty says governs outer space activities as well.⁶⁹\n⁶² See Wolf, supra note 3.\n⁶³ These ASATs may employ microwave, radiofrequency jamming, laser, chemical spraying, kinetic kill and robotic technologies to attack satellites. See Patrick Tucker, China, Russia Building Attack Satellites and Space Lasers: Pentagon Report, DEFENSE ONE (Feb. 12, 2019), https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/02/china-russia-building-attack-satellites-and-space-lasers-pentagon-report/154819/.\n⁶⁴ See id.\n⁶⁵ P.J.

III.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 419\nAdditionally, the nature of cyberspace, because it is intangible, presents many challenges that traditional international law does not address. Due to its infancy, even more so than space exploration, there is no clear standard of international legal norms in the area of cybersecurity.⁷⁰ Rather, there are mostly theories and suggestions as to how the traditional rules and principles apply in this new domain.\nAccording to Article 38 of the Statute governing the International Court of Justice (ICJ), public international law consists of three primary sources: (1) international conventions, (2) international custom, as evidence of general practice accepted as law and (3) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.⁷¹ In addition, judicial decisions and the “teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations” may serve as subsidiary sources.⁷² Finally, there are various other sources of soft law, such as memoranda of understanding, recommendations, principles and resolutions, which lack the same enforcement measures of “hard law” but serve as useful persuasive authority.⁷³ These subsidiary sources are particularly useful in space law considering the field’s infancy, even more so compared to space law due to the recent advance of computer technology, and lack of internationally binding legal instruments.\n## A. Treaties\n### i. The Outer Space Treaty\nThe foundational international convention governing space activities is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.⁷⁴ According to the Treaty, all space activities should be carried out in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, in the interest of maintaining peace, security, cooperation and understanding, and States should act with “due regard” to the interests of all other parties to\n⁷⁰ See Duggal, supra note 22.\n⁷¹ Statute of the International Court of Justice Art. 38 June 26 1945, 6 L.N.T.S. 391-413.\n⁷² Id. at art. 38.4\n⁷³ See Francis Lyall &amp; Paul B. Larsen, Space Law: A Treatise 47-48 (Routledge ed., 2d ed. 2018).\n⁷⁴ Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20.\n420 JOURNAL OF SPACE LAW [VOL. 45.2\nthe treaty.⁷⁵ Thus, treaties, custom and other sources of general international law also govern outer space activities.\nAdditionally, the placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in space is prohibited.⁷⁶ However, nothing in the treaty addresses non-nuclear space weapons explicitly, though Article IV says that the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used only for peaceful purposes, but launching other types of weapons into space, depending on the purpose and capability of destruction, could go against the Treaty’s overall object and purpose of maintaining peace and security.⁷⁷ Nevertheless, the Treaty does not explicitly prohibit non-physical threats, such as cyber intrusions.\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides for some redress for violations of international law. States who conduct national activities in outer space bear “international responsibility” for such activities but are only “liable” for physical damage caused by space objects they launch into outer space whereas the Liability Convention expands in more detail on when a State actually must pay for damages.⁷⁸\n## ii. The Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention provides that States should pay for damage caused by objects the State launches into outer space.⁷⁹ Liability should be distinguished from “international responsibility.”⁸⁰ Specifically, it states that “[a] launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.”⁸¹ If damage is caused elsewhere, the launching State “shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.”⁸² But the Convention defines “damage” as death,\n---\n⁷⁵ *Id.* at arts.

VI, VII.\n⁷⁹ Liability Convention, *supra* note 25.\n⁸⁰ The Outer Space Treaty on its own does not say that a State deemed “internationally responsible” must pay compensatory damages to the injured State. See Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. VI.\n⁸¹ Liability Convention, *supra* note 25, art. II.\n⁸² *Id.* at art. III.\n2021]\nCOMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS\n421\nphysical injury or loss or damage to property; “launching state” as a State that launches or from whose territory a space object is launched; and a “space object” as components and parts of the space object itself and the launching vehicle.83 So, although a cyber-attack could cause physical as well as intangible damage to a satellite, under this treaty, it is unlikely that the drafters of this Convention anticipated non-physical threats by other actors in outer space, so hackers will likely not to be considered a State that launches an object into space.\niii. The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter, the foundational treaty of the United Nations (UN), governs outer space activities per Article III of the Outer Space Treaty.84 The Charter, among many other things, prohibits the use of force and requires States to resolve disputes by peaceful means unless the UN approves the use of force by resolution or the State uses force in self-defense.85 These principles raise the question of whether hacking, jamming or interfering with satellites through cyberspace constitutes a use of force because it is not necessarily an “armed” attack in the traditional sense.86\niv. Budapest Convention on Cybercrime\nAlthough many US states have domestic privacy and data security laws,87 there is no real international standard regarding how\n83 Id. at art. I.\n84 See Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art. III.\n85 U.N. Charter arts. 2(4), 39-51. For an interesting discussion on the U.N.

See Claus Kress, On the Principles of Non-Use of Force in Current International Law, JUST SECURITY (Sept. 30, 2019), https://www.justsecurity.org/66372/on-the-principle-of-non-use-of-force-in-current-international-law/. Interestingly, Professor Kress notes that the question of whether harmful cyber operations violate this prohibition is uncertain because while cyber operations can cause massive damage to critical national infrastructure, the harms would be mainly economic in nature.\n86 Id. at art. 2(4).\n87 Many recent state laws in the US provide stronger protection to individuals’ personally identifiable information (PII) and say what businesses can and cannot do with such information that they collect from consumers. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives more rights to consumers and control over their information. See Cal. Civ. Code 1.81 § 1798.100-1798.199 (West 2018). For an in-depth analysis on the CCPA, the nation’s first major comprehensive consumer privacy law, see\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nnation-States should handle cyber-security attacks.⁸⁸ The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is the first and only international convention that specifically seeks to address Internet crime.⁸⁹ The treaty attempts to harmonize the laws addressing copyright infringement, computer fraud, child pornography and violations of network security.⁹⁰ However, it only has sixty-seven signatories, and its scope is narrow.⁹¹ Despite the original intention that the Convention apply globally, the US only ratified it in 2006,⁹² while various States that hold strong nationalism and sovereignty views, such as Russia, unsurprisingly, oppose it.⁹³ It has garnered little recognition and significance since its adoption.\n## B.

While there is little authority on State attribution in the cyber context, the *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* serves as a useful reference guide on the current State of customary international law, particularly on this topic.¹⁰⁶\n## C. Subsidiary Sources and Soft Law\nIn addition to treaties and customary international law, subsidiary sources can be a useful, additional authority. These could include opinions from the ICJ on general subjects of international law. Given the novelty of cyberattacks on space assets, scholarly commentary are also useful sources, especially considering the lack of established binding legal authority in this area. Additionally, Unite Nations principles, declarations and resolutions serve as useful “soft law” that do not have the same binding effect as treaties and other primary sources of international law. They are indicative, however, of State practice and international consensus.\n---\n¹⁰³ See DRAFT ARTICLES ON RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS WITH COMMENTARY ARTS. 2, 4, 8, INT’L LAW COMM’N 2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf ([hereinafter DRAFT ARTICLES].\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.*\n¹⁰⁵ See *id.* § 905.\n¹⁰⁶ See generally TALLINN MANUAL 2.0 *supra* note 88.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 425\n## III. HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN PREVENT AND PROVIDE REDRESS FOR A MAJOR CYBER-ATTACK ON A SATELLITE SYSTEM\nA successful cyber-attack on a satellite could interfere with the space object’s flight control, payload control or transmission.¹⁰⁷ Because the Outer Space Treaty says that space activities are governed by international law,¹⁰⁸ if such an attack were to occur, the State or private company whose satellite was compromised would turn to international law to evaluate its response options and any potential recourse the attacker owes. The injured satellite operator will want assurances and effective enforcement measures from the law that discourage and disincentivize hostile actors from committing attacks.\n### A. Prevention and Risk Mitigation: How Hacking Satellites Violates International Law\nThe space law treaties say little specifically about how States can prevent against possible cyber military or terrorist attacks in space but are more concerned with the peaceful use and exploration of outer space for the “province of all [hu]mankind.”¹⁰⁹ However, there are various ways that general international law can be violated when a hacker invades a government or private satellite’s network.\nFirst, a cyber-attack, depending on its nature and scope, could qualify as a violation of international law because it is a prohibited “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.¹¹⁰ Second, a cyber-attack may constitute a violation of a State’s territorial\n---\n¹⁰⁷ See Elizabeth Howell, *What Is A Satellite?*, SPACE.COM (Oct. 27, 2017), https://www.space.com/24839-satellites.html.\n¹⁰⁸ Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. III.\n¹⁰⁹ *Id.* at art. I.\n¹¹⁰ See UN Charter art. 2(4). For instance, a hacker State could use prohibited force against another State directly by interfering with its weather or Internet communications, causing technology failures, transportation shutdowns, or emergency responses that would likely cause significant physical damage. This type of hack would more clearly qualify as a use of force because it resulted in physical damage, even if the hacker was not using armed force in the traditional sense. Alternatively, a more indirect use of force could be economic in nature, such as collapsing a State’s stock exchange system or financial institutions, which would be more difficult to show as a violation of the UN Charter.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsovereignty.¹¹¹ But whether a violation of international law actually occurs will be highly context specific.\ni. Cyber-Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite’s Network As a “Use of Force” Prohibited by the United Nations Charter\nWhether the UN’s prohibition against the use of force, and exception for self-defense measures, applies to cyberspace is generally unresolved by international law and highly dependent on each State’s particular interpretation of the Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter says that States may use force in self-defense or in anticipation of an impending attack “if an armed attack occurs.”¹¹² Although cyber activities are not “armed” in the traditional sense,¹¹³ a successful cyber operation against a satellite system could qualify as an armed attack under international law depending on the circumstances of the attack.¹¹⁴ The theory accepted by most States on Article 2(4)’s applicability in cyberspace argues that an attack may be deemed “armed” if its scope and effect are equivalent to that of a\n¹¹¹ A cyber-attack that crosses State borders, unlike traditional violations of territorial sovereignty, is more difficult to determine because of the intangible nature of cyberspace. If a hacker caused massive amounts of damage to another State across the globe, without ever actually setting foot in that State, it would be difficult to argue that the hacker violated traditional principles of sovereignty, which focuses on a State’s exclusive jurisdiction over physical territory. See supra note 100.\n¹¹² UN Charter arts. 2(4); see also art. 51 (permitting States to use force in self defense against an armed attack).\n¹¹³ See Benedikt Pirker, supra note 99.\n¹¹⁴ Id. Depending on the target, extent of damage, intentions of the attacker, and a variety of other factual circumstances, a cyber attack may or may not qualify as a “use of force” under the UN Charter. While hackers generally are not “armed” in the traditional sense of having physical weapons, they could cause massive damage to variety of information and communications systems through malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, zero-day exploits, or domain name system (DNS) tunnelling. See What is a Cyberattack? CISCO (last visited Sept. 6, 2022), https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html#-types-of-cyber-attacks.\nFor instance, a malware attack, commonly understood as a cyber-attack using malicious software to breach a network vulnerability and block access, install harmful software, steal data, or render the system inoperable, that shut down aviation systems could qualify as a prohibited use of force because it would cause massive damage to a State’s transportation infrastructure and was clearly intended to disrupt those communication systems. See id. By contrast, a man-in-the middle attack that merely eavesdrops and obtains information from an important government transaction may be damaging and potentially illegal, but would be less likely to qualify as a use of force under the UN Charter. See id.; UN Charter art. 2(4).\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 427\nphysical attack.¹¹⁵ Other theories take a more holistic view and consider various factors such as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legality.¹¹⁶ This section focuses on the “effects” test, as it is the test followed by most States and the US.¹¹⁷\nUnder the “effects” test, a hacker that intentionally causes physical damage to a satellite will have violated the UN’s prohibition on force and thus committed an internationally wrongful act.¹¹⁸ The US in particular considers “clandestine” military operations conducted in cyberspace to be traditional military activity.¹¹⁹ For instance, if Chinese military operatives were to intentionally invade a US military satellite network to destroy it or cause it to collide into another satellite in space, this conduct would violate the UN Charter’s prohibition under the US interpretation because the operatives have caused clear tangible damage to US military assets.\nHowever, if the cyber intrusion causes more of an economic or dignitary harm, such as information theft, that does not have a direct physical effect, delineating between permissible and prohibited acts under international law becomes less clear. The ICJ has ruled on drawing this line in *Nicaragua v. United States* when it found that the US merely funding Nicaraguan guerillas who opposed their government did not use prohibited force against the State.¹²⁰ The US did use force, however, when it armed and trained those forces, even without any immediate physical effects.¹²¹ This case suggests that some additional, and intentional, steps must be taken by hackers beyond mere access for an intrusion to constitute a prohibited use of force under the effects test. So, if Chinese military operatives only gained access to a satellite communications system merely to infiltrate the system, as they allegedly did in 2007 and\n¹¹⁵ This theory is referred to as the “effects” test.

Cyber Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite's Network as a Violation of a State's Territorial Sovereignty\nA State can also violate international law with a cyber intrusion if it interferes with another State's sovereignty or territorial integrity.¹²⁴ Like with the UN prohibition against the use of force, drawing the line between legal conduct and an illegal violation of State sovereignty can be murky.¹²⁵ In the Corfu Channel Case, for instance, the ICJ found that the United Kingdom (UK) did not violate Albania's sovereignty when its warships passed through Albanian waters during World War II without permission from the government but did when it went back into the waters to conduct minesweeping operations later on.¹²⁶ While some amount of coercion will not amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty, when an interference crosses the line to become a prohibited intervention, this will violate international law.¹²⁷ In the cyber context, a minor interference, such as the alleged Chinese interference in 2007 and 2008,¹²⁸ that causes little or no disturbance or damage, would likely not qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty because it is more akin to \"passing through.\"¹²⁹ But, at certain point, a cyber interference could become a sovereignty violation when it rises to the level of the minesweeping activity in the Corfu Channel Case.¹³⁰ Following the reasoning of this case, a State who infiltrates a satellite system merely to \"pass through\" would likely not violate international law. But taking data, damaging the satellite, or manipulating its transmission would be more akin to \"minesweeping\" and thus a\n¹²² See Wolf, supra note 3.\n¹²³ Id.\n¹²⁴ See Pirker, supra note 99, at 192.\n¹²⁵ Id.\n¹²⁶ U.K. v.

Unlike a channel of water that clearly sits within a State’s physical borders, cyberspace, like outer space, has been argued to be a “global commons.”¹³⁴ A global commons is an area located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any particular State to which all nations have access.¹³⁵ The Outer Space Treaty suggests that outer space is a global commons when it calls it the province of all of humankind.¹³⁶ However, cyberspace, unlike outer space, more suitably falls under the sovereign jurisdiction of individual States. For one, cyberspace is run by physical servers and modems, and when a virus is transmitted to a network, it can be traced to a physical source.¹³⁷ Additionally, States can prevent others from accessing their content outside of the country because they have their own Internet regulators, filters and IP addresses. By contrast, outer space still exists within physical space and is not subject to the same constraints and regulation as the Internet. But any State is free to explore outer space without permission from another State.¹³⁸ It has no physical territory of origin because it exists all\n¹³¹ Id.\n¹³² Id.\n¹³³ U.K v.Alb., 1949 I.C.J. at 35-36.\n¹³⁴ See Pirker, supra note 99, at 195.\n¹³⁵ See OFF.

Although the US has not officially recognized outer space as a global commons, there is an argument for deeming it one due to the language in the treaty. The four universally recognized global commons include Antarctica, the atmosphere, the oceans and seas and outer space. See UN TASK TEAM AGENDA, supra note 135.\n¹³⁷ See generally Pirker, supra note 99.\n¹³⁸ Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, arts.

Hackers will generally invade the physical server located on Earth that will then send signals and commands to the space-based object. So, even if satellites were not subject to national appropriation once launched into outer space, most hacking occurs on the Earth. Additionally, even if a hacker attacked a satellite in space directly, such as through an ASAT weapon,¹⁴⁰ the satellite is the property of the State or private company. While space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation,¹⁴¹ property launched into space is.¹⁴² Thus, a major cyber-attack against a State or privately-owned satellite would likely be deemed a violation of State sovereignty, presuming it qualifies as more than just \"passing through.\"¹⁴³\n## B. State Response and Redress\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides that States should bear international responsibility, distinguished from liability, for national activities in outer space.¹⁴⁴ The law of State responsibility governs how States may respond to acts of aggression under international law.¹⁴⁵ However, there are often rogue hackers whose actions cannot be attributable to a State government. Likewise, the Liability Convention expands on the Outer Space Treaty, providing a special framework for State liability for damage that a State causes object.¹⁴⁶ Because this Convention was adopted before the existence of the Internet and when only a few States conducted activities in\n¹³⁹ Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

I, II.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 431\nouter space, it only applies in a narrow set of circumstances and assumes that the “launching State” has control over space objects and will be the party responsible for clearly physical damage.¹⁴⁷ However, a hostile actor who damages a satellite system through cyberspace, even if associated with the State itself, will rarely be launching anything, and even if it were, it is not a space object causing damage but a computer virus or malware.\ni. Determining International Responsibility and Response Options\nIf a State violates international law, either directly or through its organs or agents,¹⁴⁸ it generally must make reparation through restitution for the loss or injury and may be responded against by the injured State.¹⁴⁹ Even if the source of a virus or malware can be traced to the territory of a particular State, the hack could have been orchestrated by a rogue actor unassociated with the government. If so, public international law provides little recourse, and the affected party must seek alternative relief. Often, a State is only suspected of sponsoring a cyberattack or is not even involved at all. For instance, in the OPM hack, the US government traced the source of the data breach to Chinese nationals but could not formally link them to the government, at least at first.¹⁵⁰ In this particular case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later charged four members of the Chinese military with the hack and explicitly tied the attack to Beijing.¹⁵¹ This case is an outlier because the US was very close to eventually being able to attribute the hackers to the Chinese government, though could not do so definitively, but in many cases, attribution to the State or even\n¹⁴⁷ See Stefan A. Kaiser &amp; Martha Mejía-Kaiser, Cyber Security in Air and Space Law, 64 Z.L.W. 396, 406-07 (2015).\n¹⁴⁸ A State may still be internationally responsible if it does not act directly but directs or controls other actors. See DRAFT ARTICLES, supra note 103, arts. 2, 4, 8.\n¹⁴⁹ See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS §§ 901, 905.\n¹⁵⁰ “While no ‘smoking gun’ was found linking the attack to a specific perpetrator, the overwhelming consensus is that OPM was hacked by State-sponsored attackers working for the Chinese government. See Josh Fruhlinger, The OPM Hack Explained: Bad Security Practices Meet China’s Captain America, CSO (Feb. 12, 2020), https://www.csoonline.com/article/3318238/the-opm-hack-explained-bad-security-practices-meet-chinas-captain-america.html.\n¹⁵¹ But the US rarely files criminal charges against foreign intelligence officers for fear of retaliation. Id.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW\n[VOL. 45.2]\nsuspected attribution cannot be determined at all because the hackers cannot be found or have no provable links to the government.¹⁵²\nAttributing a cyberattack to a State can be a difficult process. First, identifying hackers can be technically challenging because they use third-party proxies and other concealment tools to mask their activities.¹⁵³ Additionally, international law lacks streamlined norms regarding cyberactivity, which makes formal attribution impractical.¹⁵⁴ According to Tallinn 2.0, “[c]yber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.”¹⁵⁵ In addition, a State is responsible for intentionally aiding or assisting, directing or controlling, or coercing another State to violate international law.¹⁵⁶ But this has proved difficult to show. For instance, officials suspected that those responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016 were linked to the Russian government, but it was not until the end of the year, after the election of President Trump, that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency formally declared that the Russian government interfered with the election, after almost a year of research, intelligence gathering and reporting.¹⁵⁷ Presumably, hackers who could infiltrate a highly secure satellite network will have to be pretty sophisticated, making it easier to hide their tracks. Thus, the rise of unidentifiable hackers or those with weak ties to State governments makes attribution less likely.\nAssuming that a cyberattack can be attributed to a State, and that that attack was a violation of international law, the Outer Space Treaty provides guidance as to what recourse and remedies are available to States after an attack has occurred.¹⁵⁸ In certain\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ See William Banks, State Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0, 95 TEX.

State Liability for Damage Caused by a Cyber Attack\nA cyberattack could compromise a satellite by causing clear physical damage or indirect damage to the satellite operator’s economic, informational, or intellectual property assets. It is much easier for a State to recover for physical damage because it can simply sue for damage to property.¹⁶³ The Liability Convention, however, only provides recourse for damage caused by space objects by the “launching State.”¹⁶⁴ A State whose agents attack another State’s satellite networks via the Internet is not necessarily launching a space object as the Convention requires.¹⁶⁵ The Convention provides liability in a narrow set of circumstances.¹⁶⁶ An intrusion may be just as damaging but only cause intellectual property or economic damage, such as when the hacker takes military intelligence stored in the satellite’s network or disrupts satellite navigational or communication signals, without directly causing any physical damage. But when it was adopted in the 1970s, the drafters of the\nwith the provisions set forth in the present [t]reaty.” Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

Interpreting the Convention's language as applying to more intangible aggression in space goes directly against the treaty's plain text. Thus, the Liability Convention would not provide a remedy unless interpreted very broadly since any State or non-State actor that hacks a satellite network will almost certainly not be physically launching an object into space. However, the State could still take the responsible party to the ICJ or domestic courts because domestic law is really where most of the regulation on data security and violations of intellectual property exist, subject to the sovereign immunity exceptions, and could succeed in such a claim depending on the nature of the attack and amount of damage caused.\n## IV. SUGGESTIONS FOR REFORM\n## A. Adopting New Treaties or Amending the Current Rules\nIn theory, States could convene to create a new treaty or, at the very least, amend the current treaties to create broader language that is more suitable to addressing intangible cyber threats to satellite systems. For instance, the Liability Convention's requirement of a \"launching State\" does not account for anything other than physical damage caused by another State's launch. However, this seemingly most obvious solution is probably the most unrealistic. First, completing this goal would be a long, arduous process with every State having different interests. Even if it succeeded, by the time a new treaty was adopted, the technology will no doubt out pace any agreement. Additionally, there have been attempts to adopt new space-related treaties that have failed. Amended treaties and additional international legal instruments that provide stronger cybersecurity protections may work temporarily but not long-term and would be met with much resistance.\n167 See Liability Convention, supra note 79, arts. I, II.\n168 See generally Blount, supra note 65.\n169 See e.g., Jeff Foust, U.S. Dismisses Space Weapons Treaty Proposal As \"Fundamentally Flawed\", SPACE NEWS (Sept. 11, 2014), https://spacenews.com/41842us-dismisses-space-weapons-treaty-proposal-as-fundamentally-flawed/.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 435\n## B. International Cooperation and Implementing More Adaptive Standards\nBecause of the inherently global nature of both cyberspace and satellites, international cooperation among States is crucial to set a baseline of international legal norms that protect satellites and satellite communications from cyber interferences. According to Blount, the primary sources that govern space law lack sufficient enforcement mechanisms.¹⁷⁰ Cybersecurity laws are a scattered and inconsistent collection of domestic laws and international norms that States have been slow to adopt.¹⁷¹ Implementing specific cybersecurity laws at the international level, particularly ones directly aimed at or capable of protecting space assets, could create a false sense of security for a time, until technology changes again, and complying with the law no longer mitigates risk.¹⁷² Although satellite operators will feel pressure to establish cybersecurity practices and standards within international space law, to maximize the Internet security of these satellites, cooperative efforts among States is necessary to protect the networks and avoid potential conflict in outer space.¹⁷³\nPerhaps there is a way to follow Blount’s approach of focusing on international cooperation and implementing adaptable standards in addition to adopting some rigid international legal instruments, or amendments to the current ones, as a long-term goal. The combination of hard legal rules with malleable standards and international cooperation could account both for the need for stricter enforcement and clearer legal rules and address Blount’s concern that technology will outpace the law. If adopting or amending a treaty is currently infeasible, perhaps the UN could impose declarations, principles, or even resolutions that reinterpret the UN Charter’s provisions to account for these new threats that the original drafters did not anticipate. Adopting an international body dedicated to cybersecurity in outer space, similar to COPUOS, could also be a potential solution, simply to bring all the relevant parties to the table to address this vexing problem.\n---\n¹⁷⁰ Blount, *supra* note 65, at 273.\n¹⁷¹ *Id.* at 293.\n¹⁷² *Id.*\n¹⁷³ *Id.*\n436 JOURNAL OF SPACE LAW [VOL. 45.2\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe convergence of cyberspace and outer space presents novel questions within space law and international law in general. Both space law and cybersecurity law are new areas, and cybersecurity law has continued to evolve and change with technology while space law has remained relatively stagnant. The novelty of these areas of the law, along with the unique physical nature of space and the intangibility of cyberspace, makes it difficult to determine what sorts of cyber intrusions to space satellite systems violate international law. While there is no clear answer as to how exactly the international legal community should deal with this problem, plenty of authority stemming from traditional international law can be utilized. Additionally, States have several options moving forward to ensure the protection of these highly sensitive space-based systems and provide relief to victims of hacks. Although adopting new international legal instruments, or modifying the current ones, would be the ideal solution, it would be unlikely to garner much support considering the various interests of the various nations. Perhaps this can remain a long-term goal, but in the meantime, States should work cooperatively, with strong support from the private sector, to adopt international legal norms and practices in the form of declarations, principles, resolutions, State practice, and perhaps even the creation of an international body dedicated to the protection of satellite systems, and other Internet-powered space technologies, in outer space."

In recent years, land-based cyber intrusions, hacks and data breaches, including ones against Equifax, Sony, the Democratic National Committee and the Office of Personnel Management, exposed masses of consumer data and compromised the networks of various private companies and governmental organizations. These significant events caused great harm to the organizations, the economy and the public. Cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for public and private organizations in recent years. However, the issue has not been meaningfully addressed among the international legal community, particularly within the space sector. If a hostile actor were to successfully infiltrate the networks of major satellite systems that orbit the Earth, which the world relies on for, among other things, communication, navigation, weather monitoring, national security and military operations, the consequences could be catastrophic. This Note addresses what sorts of cyber-attacks or intrusions to a satellite system would constitute a violation of international law and to what degree a State can respond and receive reparation for damage, either physical or otherwise, caused. It concludes that the application of currently accepted legal * Andrew Fois is a recent graduate of Georgetown University Law Center.

The Note applies the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force, the law of State responsibility, sovereignty and other principles of international law to hypothesize how the current international regime could address such a scenario. It concludes with the suggestion that: 1) the international space law community adopt cooperative and streamlined norms, standards and initiatives that are adaptable to constantly evolving technologies, including the formation of an international body dedicated to cyber issues in outer space that would bring all relevant parties together; and 2) within that framework consider implementing amendments to the space law treaties as a long-term goal.\n## I. INTRODUCTION When a powerful Soviet satellite armed with electromagnetic pulse weaponry falls into the wrong hands, British intelligence agents had to risk their lives to prevent the space-based weapon from incapacitating electricity-powered technologies on Earth in a destructive blast.¹ While this is the somewhat far-fetched plot of the 1995 James Bond film *Goldeneye*, the film illustrates the importance of artificial space-based satellites and the potential disaster that could result if a hostile actor gained control of one. Although no satellite capable of such mass destruction orbits the Earth currently, various military and civilian observation, communication, weather and navigational satellites, if compromised, could have similarly drastic consequences, particularly as satellite technologies advance and hostile intruders become more sophisticated, especially by utilizing Internet-based attacks.² The problem of an artificial satellite becoming compromised due to a cyber intrusion of its network is not completely theoretical. In 2007 and 2008, several United States (US) military satellites were hacked through a ground station in Norway—the Chinese ¹ See GOLDENEYE (United Artists 1995).\n² See William Akoto, *What Happens When All the Tiny Satellites We’re Shooting Into Space Get Hacked?*, FAST COMPANY (Feb. 15, 2020), https://www.fastcompany.com/90464666/what-happens-when-all-the-tiny-satellites-were-shooting-into-space-get-hacked.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW [VOL. 45.2] military is the prime suspect.³ A Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1 satellite, which are used for climate and terrain monitoring by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Geological Survey (USGS), each experienced several minutes of interference.⁴ Luckily, no commands were successfully sent to the satellite and no data was captured by the hackers.⁵ However, it is concerning that these adversary possibly State hackers managed to infiltrate a highly sensitive network and gain access to the satellites' controls.⁶ Attempts did not end there. Another hacking campaign, allegedly by the Chinese again, occurred in 2018 when hackers intruded into the networks of satellite operators of private defense contractors and telecommunications companies.⁷ Although the international space community is beginning to consider the consequences of a successful hacking campaign on space technologies,⁸ it is only a matter of time before a State, one of its agents, or even an unidentifiable non-State actor successfully infiltrates a crucial commercial or government-owned satellite system and damages, destroys, steals sensitive data or manipulates its transmission.\nSatellites today are capable of a variety of functionality and have highly advanced technological capability.

Now more than ever is the time to start taking cybersecurity more seriously.\nA major breach of certain satellite networks by sophisticated actors could have drastic effects, depending on the intentions of the intruder. For instance, the US military uses the USA 224 satellite for detailed spying all around the Earth for military activities.¹⁷ If that satellite were compromised, hackers could acquire invaluable and classified US intelligence, threaten US military operations and perhaps even manipulate the satellite's transmission to complete military objectives adverse to the interests of the US. Similarly, a hacker could also disrupt a geostationary weather satellite, such as the GOES series,¹⁸ causing weather prediction to be disrupted, or one of the many commercial telecommunications satellites that power critical infrastructure. Other disruptions could affect air traffic controls, cable and network television broadcasts, cell-phone communications, military intelligence and environmental monitoring.¹⁹ Current space law would likely never allow the launching of a satellite like Goldeneye with nuclear capabilities specifically designed as an electromagnetic weapon.²⁰ But satellites launched in the next several decades, especially as the private sector develops its space industry, may have capabilities that seem unimaginable today.

This question is particularly difficult to answer since there is no clear international framework governing cybersecurity on its own let alone cybersecurity in space.²² Additionally, the distinctive physical nature of both cyberspace and outer space presents challenges as to how these laws apply.²³ Although the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in outer space,²⁴ other means of destroying or interfering with a satellite are not directly prohibited by any of the five main treaties governing outer space.²⁵ However, the major principles drawn from those ²¹ See Brian Barrett, *How 4 Chinese Hackers Allegedly Took Down Equifax*, WIRED (Feb. 10, 2020), https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-hack-china/.\n²² Although many States have enacted their own domestic cybersecurity laws, there is not much governing such activities on the international plane.

The Rescue Agreement elaborates on elements of articles V and VIII of the Outer Space Treaty, providing that States take all possible steps to rescue and assist astronauts in distress and promptly return them to the launching State and that States, upon request, assist launching states in recovering space objects outside the launching State’s territory. Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space, Apr. 22, 1968, 19 U.S.T. 7570.\nThe Liability Convention elaborates on article VII of the Outer Space Treaty, providing that a launching State should be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space objects on the surface of Earth or to aircraft and due to activities in space. It also provides procedures for settling claims for damages. Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Mar. 29, 1972, 24 U.S.T. 2389 [hereinafter Liability Convention].\n\ntreaties, along with other areas of international law, such as the law of State responsibility,²⁶ the United Nations (UN) prohibition against the use of force²⁷ and principles of sovereignty,²⁸ may offer some guidance. Despite the recognition of cybersecurity’s importance on outer space technologies by many in the international space community,²⁹ the current legal framework warrants improvement. A streamlined, cooperative legal approach at the international, domestic and market levels is still needed.³⁰ Part II of this Note discusses the background and history of the space race alongside the emergence of the Internet and how space and nuclear-capable States have developed into major cybersecurity threats against one another. Part III outlines the current international space law and general international law, most relevant to the issue of cyber intrusions against satellites. Part IV addresses specifically how current law can prevent and mitigate the risk of cyber-security breaches of artificial satellites and discusses what international resources and remedies are available if such an event were to occur. It posits that the current international legal framework is insufficient and suggests possible reforms to the law and other cooperative actions that the international space law community should take, including the formation of new UN body The Registration Convention builds upon the Outer Space Treaty, Rescue Agreement, and Liability Convention creates a mechanism to help States identify space objects by expanding the scope of the UN Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space and addressed issues relating to State parties’ responsibilities concerning space objects. Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, Jan. 14, 1975, 28 U.S.T. 695.\nThe Moon Agreement reaffirms and elaborates on many elements of the Outer Space Treaty as applied to the moon and other celestial bodies, providing that those bodies should be used only for peaceful purposes, their environments not disrupted, that the UN should be informed of the location and purpose of any station on those bodies. Additionally, and that the Moon and its natural resources are the common heritage of mankind and that an international regime should be established to govern the exploitation of such resources if exploitation becomes feasible.

BACKGROUND ## A. The Cold War’s Significance on the Space Race Alongside the Internet’s Development The Cold War solidified the status of Russia, at that time the Soviet Union, and the US as the two primary players in both the space race and the nuclear arms race.³¹ Space was linked to nuclear disarmament during this period.³² After the 1967 launch of Sputnik, the world’s first artificial satellite, into orbit by the Soviet Union, the US and the Soviet Union competed in their space capabilities with various launches and experiments. The US capabilities demonstrably surpassed the Soviets with Apollo 8 orbiting the Moon and Apollo 11 putting humans on the Moon at the end of the decade.³³ In fact, the Moon landing may even have been a catalyst to the end of the Cold War and the cementing of the US’s advantage over the Soviets in the nuclear arms and space races.³⁴ Notably, the same technology used to launch Sputnik into space was intended by the Soviets as a way to deliver intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBMs).³⁵ At the same time, the Internet was developed largely as a reaction to the events of the Cold War.³⁶ The US military created ³¹ See Bradley G.

The first computer virus was discovered in 1971 during the ARPANET age.³⁹ By 1983, the US filed its first patent for cybersecurity protection to prevent these intrusions.⁴⁰ Beginning in the early 2000s, State and non-State hackers became more organized and sophisticated. For instance, Anonymous, the first major hacker group, committed various attacks against governmental organizations and corporations, mainly in the name of privacy.⁴¹ By the 2010s, the US began to identify even more sophisticated security breaches committed by State-sponsored intelligence operatives for the first time.⁴² Today, cybersecurity is a major concern for individuals, governments and corporations as organizations rely almost exclusively on Internet-capable technologies.

Today, most devices, including satellites, rely on the Internet, and with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), that will only increase.\nHistory shows that satellites are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which scholar P. J. Blount argues are merely one form of IoT,⁵⁹ and given the rise of military activities in outer space⁶⁰ and military cyber espionage and attacks,⁶¹ there is no reason to doubt that a State or nonaligned hacker group may attempt to infiltrate and and stealing trade secrets and highly personal data from millions of Americans.

The Chinese have already been suspected of successfully gained access to the Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1.⁶² The Pentagon has also reported that both the Chinese and Russians are developing lasers and a host of other anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, which could track, study, or even target adversary satellites through physical, kinetic, microwave and cyber technologies.⁶³ This Pentagon report also apparently indicated that the Chinese and Russians are preparing to employ offensive and defensive ASAT technology, which could extend to cyber infiltration of satellites as well.⁶⁴ Blount argues that it is only a matter of time before military conflict occurs in outer space.⁶⁵ He notes that although China and the US have developed ASAT technologies, no legal instrument has been adopted to regulate them.⁶⁶ Blount goes on to suggest that the rules of armed conflict from international humanitarian law should extend to military activities in space.⁶⁷ Blount’s ideas serve as a useful starting point in examining what sorts of international rules could be adopted to effectively regulate and prevent cyber attacks against satellites.\n## II. CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REGIME Both international law in general and international space law in particular provide legal protections to both States and private satellite operators to ensure the security of their satellites in space. Because there are only five treaties⁶⁸ governing space activities specifically, much of the law applicable to cybersecurity of satellites comes from general public international law, which the Outer Space Treaty says governs outer space activities as well.⁶⁹ ⁶² See Wolf, supra note 3.\n⁶³ These ASATs may employ microwave, radiofrequency jamming, laser, chemical spraying, kinetic kill and robotic technologies to attack satellites.

Due to its infancy, even more so than space exploration, there is no clear standard of international legal norms in the area of cybersecurity.⁷⁰ Rather, there are mostly theories and suggestions as to how the traditional rules and principles apply in this new domain.\nAccording to Article 38 of the Statute governing the International Court of Justice (ICJ), public international law consists of three primary sources: (1) international conventions, (2) international custom, as evidence of general practice accepted as law and (3) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.⁷¹ In addition, judicial decisions and the “teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations” may serve as subsidiary sources.⁷² Finally, there are various other sources of soft law, such as memoranda of understanding, recommendations, principles and resolutions, which lack the same enforcement measures of “hard law” but serve as useful persuasive authority.⁷³ These subsidiary sources are particularly useful in space law considering the field’s infancy, even more so compared to space law due to the recent advance of computer technology, and lack of internationally binding legal instruments.\n## A.

Larsen, Space Law: A Treatise 47-48 (Routledge ed., 2d ed. 2018).\n⁷⁴ Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20.\n\nthe treaty.⁷⁵ Thus, treaties, custom and other sources of general international law also govern outer space activities.\nAdditionally, the placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in space is prohibited.⁷⁶ However, nothing in the treaty addresses non-nuclear space weapons explicitly, though Article IV says that the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used only for peaceful purposes, but launching other types of weapons into space, depending on the purpose and capability of destruction, could go against the Treaty’s overall object and purpose of maintaining peace and security.⁷⁷ Nevertheless, the Treaty does not explicitly prohibit non-physical threats, such as cyber intrusions.\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides for some redress for violations of international law. States who conduct national activities in outer space bear “international responsibility” for such activities but are only “liable” for physical damage caused by space objects they launch into outer space whereas the Liability Convention expands in more detail on when a State actually must pay for damages.⁷⁸ ## ii. The Liability Convention The Liability Convention provides that States should pay for damage caused by objects the State launches into outer space.⁷⁹ Liability should be distinguished from “international responsibility.”⁸⁰ Specifically, it states that “[a] launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.”⁸¹ If damage is caused elsewhere, the launching State “shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.”⁸² But the Convention defines “damage” as death, --- ⁷⁵ *Id.* at arts.

The United Nations Charter The UN Charter, the foundational treaty of the United Nations (UN), governs outer space activities per Article III of the Outer Space Treaty.84 The Charter, among many other things, prohibits the use of force and requires States to resolve disputes by peaceful means unless the UN approves the use of force by resolution or the State uses force in self-defense.85 These principles raise the question of whether hacking, jamming or interfering with satellites through cyberspace constitutes a use of force because it is not necessarily an “armed” attack in the traditional sense.86 iv. Budapest Convention on Cybercrime Although many US states have domestic privacy and data security laws,87 there is no real international standard regarding how JOURNAL OF SPACE LAW [VOL. 45.2] nation-States should handle cyber-security attacks.⁸⁸ The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is the first and only international convention that specifically seeks to address Internet crime.⁸⁹ The treaty attempts to harmonize the laws addressing copyright infringement, computer fraud, child pornography and violations of network security.⁹⁰ However, it only has sixty-seven signatories, and its scope is narrow.⁹¹ Despite the original intention that the Convention apply globally, the US only ratified it in 2006,⁹² while various States that hold strong nationalism and sovereignty views, such as Russia, unsurprisingly, oppose it.⁹³ It has garnered little recognition and significance since its adoption.\n## B.

Violating Another State’s Sovereignty States can violate international law by interfering with another State’s sovereignty or territorial integrity.⁹⁹ Territorial sovereignty means that a State exercises complete and exclusive jurisdiction over its physical territory.¹⁰⁰ The ICJ has stressed that “respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.”¹⁰¹ Traditionally, whether a State violated another State’s sovereignty could easily be determined because it was dependent on physical borders.¹⁰² However, determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation can be difficult in the space and cyber context due to its cross-border nature and the fact that a hack might not actually occur in outer space but rather through servers on Earth.\n## iii.

While there is little authority on State attribution in the cyber context, the *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* serves as a useful reference guide on the current State of customary international law, particularly on this topic.¹⁰⁶ ## C. Subsidiary Sources and Soft Law In addition to treaties and customary international law, subsidiary sources can be a useful, additional authority. These could include opinions from the ICJ on general subjects of international law. Given the novelty of cyberattacks on space assets, scholarly commentary are also useful sources, especially considering the lack of established binding legal authority in this area. Additionally, Unite Nations principles, declarations and resolutions serve as useful “soft law” that do not have the same binding effect as treaties and other primary sources of international law. They are indicative, however, of State practice and international consensus.\n--- ¹⁰³ See DRAFT ARTICLES ON RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS WITH COMMENTARY ARTS. 2, 4, 8, INT’L LAW COMM’N 2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf ([hereinafter DRAFT ARTICLES].\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.* ¹⁰⁵ See *id.* § 905.\n¹⁰⁶ See generally TALLINN MANUAL 2.0 *supra* note 88.\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 425 ## III. HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN PREVENT AND PROVIDE REDRESS FOR A MAJOR CYBER-ATTACK ON A SATELLITE SYSTEM A successful cyber-attack on a satellite could interfere with the space object’s flight control, payload control or transmission.¹⁰⁷ Because the Outer Space Treaty says that space activities are governed by international law,¹⁰⁸ if such an attack were to occur, the State or private company whose satellite was compromised would turn to international law to evaluate its response options and any potential recourse the attacker owes. The injured satellite operator will want assurances and effective enforcement measures from the law that discourage and disincentivize hostile actors from committing attacks.\n### A. Prevention and Risk Mitigation: How Hacking Satellites Violates International Law The space law treaties say little specifically about how States can prevent against possible cyber military or terrorist attacks in space but are more concerned with the peaceful use and exploration of outer space for the “province of all [hu]mankind.”¹⁰⁹ However, there are various ways that general international law can be violated when a hacker invades a government or private satellite’s network.\nFirst, a cyber-attack, depending on its nature and scope, could qualify as a violation of international law because it is a prohibited “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.¹¹⁰ Second, a cyber-attack may constitute a violation of a State’s territorial --- ¹⁰⁷ See Elizabeth Howell, *What Is A Satellite?*, SPACE.COM (Oct. 27, 2017), https://www.space.com/24839-satellites.html.\n¹⁰⁸ Outer Space Treaty, *supra* note 20, art. III.\n¹⁰⁹ *Id.* at art. I.\n¹¹⁰ See UN Charter art. 2(4). For instance, a hacker State could use prohibited force against another State directly by interfering with its weather or Internet communications, causing technology failures, transportation shutdowns, or emergency responses that would likely cause significant physical damage. This type of hack would more clearly qualify as a use of force because it resulted in physical damage, even if the hacker was not using armed force in the traditional sense. Alternatively, a more indirect use of force could be economic in nature, such as collapsing a State’s stock exchange system or financial institutions, which would be more difficult to show as a violation of the UN Charter.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW [VOL. 45.2] sovereignty.¹¹¹ But whether a violation of international law actually occurs will be highly context specific.\ni. Cyber-Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite’s Network As a “Use of Force” Prohibited by the United Nations Charter Whether the UN’s prohibition against the use of force, and exception for self-defense measures, applies to cyberspace is generally unresolved by international law and highly dependent on each State’s particular interpretation of the Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter says that States may use force in self-defense or in anticipation of an impending attack “if an armed attack occurs.”¹¹² Although cyber activities are not “armed” in the traditional sense,¹¹³ a successful cyber operation against a satellite system could qualify as an armed attack under international law depending on the circumstances of the attack.¹¹⁴ The theory accepted by most States on Article 2(4)’s applicability in cyberspace argues that an attack may be deemed “armed” if its scope and effect are equivalent to that of a ¹¹¹ A cyber-attack that crosses State borders, unlike traditional violations of territorial sovereignty, is more difficult to determine because of the intangible nature of cyberspace. If a hacker caused massive amounts of damage to another State across the globe, without ever actually setting foot in that State, it would be difficult to argue that the hacker violated traditional principles of sovereignty, which focuses on a State’s exclusive jurisdiction over physical territory. See supra note 100.\n¹¹² UN Charter arts. 2(4); see also art. 51 (permitting States to use force in self defense against an armed attack).\n¹¹³ See Benedikt Pirker, supra note 99.\n¹¹⁴ Id. Depending on the target, extent of damage, intentions of the attacker, and a variety of other factual circumstances, a cyber attack may or may not qualify as a “use of force” under the UN Charter. While hackers generally are not “armed” in the traditional sense of having physical weapons, they could cause massive damage to variety of information and communications systems through malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, zero-day exploits, or domain name system (DNS) tunnelling. See What is a Cyberattack? CISCO (last visited Sept. 6, 2022), https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html#-types-of-cyber-attacks.\nFor instance, a malware attack, commonly understood as a cyber-attack using malicious software to breach a network vulnerability and block access, install harmful software, steal data, or render the system inoperable, that shut down aviation systems could qualify as a prohibited use of force because it would cause massive damage to a State’s transportation infrastructure and was clearly intended to disrupt those communication systems. See id. By contrast, a man-in-the middle attack that merely eavesdrops and obtains information from an important government transaction may be damaging and potentially illegal, but would be less likely to qualify as a use of force under the UN Charter. See id.; UN Charter art. 2(4).\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 427 physical attack.¹¹⁵ Other theories take a more holistic view and consider various factors such as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legality.¹¹⁶ This section focuses on the “effects” test, as it is the test followed by most States and the US.¹¹⁷ Under the “effects” test, a hacker that intentionally causes physical damage to a satellite will have violated the UN’s prohibition on force and thus committed an internationally wrongful act.¹¹⁸ The US in particular considers “clandestine” military operations conducted in cyberspace to be traditional military activity.¹¹⁹ For instance, if Chinese military operatives were to intentionally invade a US military satellite network to destroy it or cause it to collide into another satellite in space, this conduct would violate the UN Charter’s prohibition under the US interpretation because the operatives have caused clear tangible damage to US military assets.\nHowever, if the cyber intrusion causes more of an economic or dignitary harm, such as information theft, that does not have a direct physical effect, delineating between permissible and prohibited acts under international law becomes less clear. The ICJ has ruled on drawing this line in *Nicaragua v. United States* when it found that the US merely funding Nicaraguan guerillas who opposed their government did not use prohibited force against the State.¹²⁰ The US did use force, however, when it armed and trained those forces, even without any immediate physical effects.¹²¹ This case suggests that some additional, and intentional, steps must be taken by hackers beyond mere access for an intrusion to constitute a prohibited use of force under the effects test. So, if Chinese military operatives only gained access to a satellite communications system merely to infiltrate the system, as they allegedly did in 2007 and ¹¹⁵ This theory is referred to as the “effects” test.

Cyber Attacks Against a Space-Based Satellite's Network as a Violation of a State's Territorial Sovereignty A State can also violate international law with a cyber intrusion if it interferes with another State's sovereignty or territorial integrity.¹²⁴ Like with the UN prohibition against the use of force, drawing the line between legal conduct and an illegal violation of State sovereignty can be murky.¹²⁵ In the Corfu Channel Case, for instance, the ICJ found that the United Kingdom (UK) did not violate Albania's sovereignty when its warships passed through Albanian waters during World War II without permission from the government but did when it went back into the waters to conduct minesweeping operations later on.¹²⁶ While some amount of coercion will not amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty, when an interference crosses the line to become a prohibited intervention, this will violate international law.¹²⁷ In the cyber context, a minor interference, such as the alleged Chinese interference in 2007 and 2008,¹²⁸ that causes little or no disturbance or damage, would likely not qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty because it is more akin to\"passing through.\"¹²⁹ But, at certain point, a cyber interference could become a sovereignty violation when it rises to the level of the minesweeping activity in the Corfu Channel Case.¹³⁰ Following the reasoning of this case, a State who infiltrates a satellite system merely to\"pass through\"would likely not violate international law. But taking data, damaging the satellite, or manipulating its transmission would be more akin to\"minesweeping\"and thus a ¹²² See Wolf, supra note 3.\n¹²³ Id.\n¹²⁴ See Pirker, supra note 99, at 192.\n¹²⁵ Id.\n¹²⁶ U.K. v.

Unlike a channel of water that clearly sits within a State’s physical borders, cyberspace, like outer space, has been argued to be a “global commons.”¹³⁴ A global commons is an area located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any particular State to which all nations have access.¹³⁵ The Outer Space Treaty suggests that outer space is a global commons when it calls it the province of all of humankind.¹³⁶ However, cyberspace, unlike outer space, more suitably falls under the sovereign jurisdiction of individual States. For one, cyberspace is run by physical servers and modems, and when a virus is transmitted to a network, it can be traced to a physical source.¹³⁷ Additionally, States can prevent others from accessing their content outside of the country because they have their own Internet regulators, filters and IP addresses. By contrast, outer space still exists within physical space and is not subject to the same constraints and regulation as the Internet. But any State is free to explore outer space without permission from another State.¹³⁸ It has no physical territory of origin because it exists all ¹³¹ Id.\n¹³² Id.\n¹³³ U.K v.Alb., 1949 I.C.J. at 35-36.\n¹³⁴ See Pirker, supra note 99, at 195.\n¹³⁵ See OFF.

Although the US has not officially recognized outer space as a global commons, there is an argument for deeming it one due to the language in the treaty. The four universally recognized global commons include Antarctica, the atmosphere, the oceans and seas and outer space.

Hackers will generally invade the physical server located on Earth that will then send signals and commands to the space-based object. So, even if satellites were not subject to national appropriation once launched into outer space, most hacking occurs on the Earth. Additionally, even if a hacker attacked a satellite in space directly, such as through an ASAT weapon,¹⁴⁰ the satellite is the property of the State or private company. While space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation,¹⁴¹ property launched into space is.¹⁴² Thus, a major cyber-attack against a State or privately-owned satellite would likely be deemed a violation of State sovereignty, presuming it qualifies as more than just\"passing through.\"¹⁴³ ## B. State Response and Redress The Outer Space Treaty provides that States should bear international responsibility, distinguished from liability, for national activities in outer space.¹⁴⁴ The law of State responsibility governs how States may respond to acts of aggression under international law.¹⁴⁵ However, there are often rogue hackers whose actions cannot be attributable to a State government. Likewise, the Liability Convention expands on the Outer Space Treaty, providing a special framework for State liability for damage that a State causes object.¹⁴⁶ Because this Convention was adopted before the existence of the Internet and when only a few States conducted activities in ¹³⁹ Outer Space Treaty, supra note 20, art.

Determining International Responsibility and Response Options If a State violates international law, either directly or through its organs or agents,¹⁴⁸ it generally must make reparation through restitution for the loss or injury and may be responded against by the injured State.¹⁴⁹ Even if the source of a virus or malware can be traced to the territory of a particular State, the hack could have been orchestrated by a rogue actor unassociated with the government. If so, public international law provides little recourse, and the affected party must seek alternative relief. Often, a State is only suspected of sponsoring a cyberattack or is not even involved at all. For instance, in the OPM hack, the US government traced the source of the data breach to Chinese nationals but could not formally link them to the government, at least at first.¹⁵⁰ In this particular case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later charged four members of the Chinese military with the hack and explicitly tied the attack to Beijing.¹⁵¹ This case is an outlier because the US was very close to eventually being able to attribute the hackers to the Chinese government, though could not do so definitively, but in many cases, attribution to the State or even ¹⁴⁷ See Stefan A. Kaiser &amp; Martha Mejía-Kaiser, Cyber Security in Air and Space Law, 64 Z.L.W. 396, 406-07 (2015).\n¹⁴⁸ A State may still be internationally responsible if it does not act directly but directs or controls other actors. See DRAFT ARTICLES, supra note 103, arts. 2, 4, 8.\n¹⁴⁹ See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS §§ 901, 905.\n¹⁵⁰ “While no ‘smoking gun’ was found linking the attack to a specific perpetrator, the overwhelming consensus is that OPM was hacked by State-sponsored attackers working for the Chinese government.

Id.\nJOURNAL OF SPACE LAW [VOL. 45.2] suspected attribution cannot be determined at all because the hackers cannot be found or have no provable links to the government.¹⁵² Attributing a cyberattack to a State can be a difficult process. First, identifying hackers can be technically challenging because they use third-party proxies and other concealment tools to mask their activities.¹⁵³ Additionally, international law lacks streamlined norms regarding cyberactivity, which makes formal attribution impractical.¹⁵⁴ According to Tallinn 2.0, “[c]yber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.”¹⁵⁵ In addition, a State is responsible for intentionally aiding or assisting, directing or controlling, or coercing another State to violate international law.¹⁵⁶ But this has proved difficult to show. For instance, officials suspected that those responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016 were linked to the Russian government, but it was not until the end of the year, after the election of President Trump, that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency formally declared that the Russian government interfered with the election, after almost a year of research, intelligence gathering and reporting.¹⁵⁷ Presumably, hackers who could infiltrate a highly secure satellite network will have to be pretty sophisticated, making it easier to hide their tracks. Thus, the rise of unidentifiable hackers or those with weak ties to State governments makes attribution less likely.\nAssuming that a cyberattack can be attributed to a State, and that that attack was a violation of international law, the Outer Space Treaty provides guidance as to what recourse and remedies are available to States after an attack has occurred.¹⁵⁸ In certain ¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ See William Banks, State Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0, 95 TEX.

State Liability for Damage Caused by a Cyber Attack A cyberattack could compromise a satellite by causing clear physical damage or indirect damage to the satellite operator’s economic, informational, or intellectual property assets. It is much easier for a State to recover for physical damage because it can simply sue for damage to property.¹⁶³ The Liability Convention, however, only provides recourse for damage caused by space objects by the “launching State.”¹⁶⁴ A State whose agents attack another State’s satellite networks via the Internet is not necessarily launching a space object as the Convention requires.¹⁶⁵ The Convention provides liability in a narrow set of circumstances.¹⁶⁶ An intrusion may be just as damaging but only cause intellectual property or economic damage, such as when the hacker takes military intelligence stored in the satellite’s network or disrupts satellite navigational or communication signals, without directly causing any physical damage.

Thus, the Liability Convention would not provide a remedy unless interpreted very broadly since any State or non-State actor that hacks a satellite network will almost certainly not be physically launching an object into space. However, the State could still take the responsible party to the ICJ or domestic courts because domestic law is really where most of the regulation on data security and violations of intellectual property exist, subject to the sovereign immunity exceptions, and could succeed in such a claim depending on the nature of the attack and amount of damage caused.\n## IV.

Adopting New Treaties or Amending the Current Rules In theory, States could convene to create a new treaty or, at the very least, amend the current treaties to create broader language that is more suitable to addressing intangible cyber threats to satellite systems. For instance, the Liability Convention's requirement of a\"launching State\"does not account for anything other than physical damage caused by another State's launch.[167] However, this seemingly most obvious solution is probably the most unrealistic. First, completing this goal would be a long, arduous process with every State having different interests. Even if it succeeded, by the time a new treaty was adopted, the technology will no doubt out pace any agreement.[168] Additionally, there have been attempts to adopt new space-related treaties that have failed.[169] Amended treaties and additional international legal instruments that provide stronger cybersecurity protections may work temporarily but not long-term and would be met with much resistance.\n\n2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 435 ## B. International Cooperation and Implementing More Adaptive Standards Because of the inherently global nature of both cyberspace and satellites, international cooperation among States is crucial to set a baseline of international legal norms that protect satellites and satellite communications from cyber interferences. According to Blount, the primary sources that govern space law lack sufficient enforcement mechanisms.¹⁷⁰ Cybersecurity laws are a scattered and inconsistent collection of domestic laws and international norms that States have been slow to adopt.¹⁷¹ Implementing specific cybersecurity laws at the international level, particularly ones directly aimed at or capable of protecting space assets, could create a false sense of security for a time, until technology changes again, and complying with the law no longer mitigates risk.¹⁷² Although satellite operators will feel pressure to establish cybersecurity practices and standards within international space law, to maximize the Internet security of these satellites, cooperative efforts among States is necessary to protect the networks and avoid potential conflict in outer space.¹⁷³ Perhaps there is a way to follow Blount’s approach of focusing on international cooperation and implementing adaptable standards in addition to adopting some rigid international legal instruments, or amendments to the current ones, as a long-term goal. The combination of hard legal rules with malleable standards and international cooperation could account both for the need for stricter enforcement and clearer legal rules and address Blount’s concern that technology will outpace the law. If adopting or amending a treaty is currently infeasible, perhaps the UN could impose declarations, principles, or even resolutions that reinterpret the UN Charter’s provisions to account for these new threats that the original drafters did not anticipate. Adopting an international body dedicated to cybersecurity in outer space, similar to COPUOS, could also be a potential solution, simply to bring all the relevant parties to the table to address this vexing problem.\n--- ¹⁷⁰ Blount, *supra* note 65, at 273.\n¹⁷¹ *Id.* at 293.\n¹⁷² *Id.* ¹⁷³ *Id.*\n\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe convergence of cyberspace and outer space presents novel questions within space law and international law in general. Both space law and cybersecurity law are new areas, and cybersecurity law has continued to evolve and change with technology while space law has remained relatively stagnant. The novelty of these areas of the law, along with the unique physical nature of space and the intangibility of cyberspace, makes it difficult to determine what sorts of cyber intrusions to space satellite systems violate international law. While there is no clear answer as to how exactly the international legal community should deal with this problem, plenty of authority stemming from traditional international law can be utilized. Additionally, States have several options moving forward to ensure the protection of these highly sensitive space-based systems and provide relief to victims of hacks. Although adopting new international legal instruments, or modifying the current ones, would be the ideal solution, it would be unlikely to garner much support considering the various interests of the various nations. Perhaps this can remain a long-term goal, but in the meantime, States should work cooperatively, with strong support from the private sector, to adopt international legal norms and practices in the form of declarations, principles, resolutions, State practice, and perhaps even the creation of an international body dedicated to the protection of satellite systems, and other Internet-powered space technologies, in outer space."

    "abstract": "This Note examines how States can utilize international law to mitigate risk and provide redress for damage to Internet-powered, space-based satellite systems by State or non-State sponsored hackers. In recent years, land-based cyber intrusions, hacks and data breaches, including ones against Equifax, Sony, the Democratic National Committee and the Office of Personnel Management, exposed masses of consumer data and compromised the networks of various private companies and governmental organizations. These significant events caused great harm to the organizations, the economy and the public. Cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for public and private organizations in recent years. However, the issue has not been meaningfully addressed among the international legal community, particularly within the space sector. If a hostile actor were to successfully infiltrate the networks of major satellite systems that orbit the Earth, which the world relies on for, among other things, communication, navigation, weather monitoring, national security and military operations, the consequences could be catastrophic. This Note addresses what sorts of cyber-attacks or intrusions to a satellite system would constitute a violation of international law and to what degree a State can respond and receive reparation for damage, either physical or otherwise, caused. It concludes that the application of currently accepted legal Andrew Fois is a recent graduate of Georgetown University Law Center. He graduated cum laude in 2021 and served as an executive editor on the Georgetown Law Journal. Currently, Andrew works as an Associate Attorney at Lawler, Metzger, Keeney & Logan, a media, communications and technology firm in Washington, D.C. 2021] COMBATTING CYBER INTRUSIONS 407 conventions do not sufficiently address new and evolving threats that have become possible due to advancing technologies. The Note applies the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force, the law of State responsibility, sovereignty and other principles of international law to hypothesize how the current international regime could address such a scenario. It concludes with the suggestion that: 1) the international space law community adopt cooperative and streamlined norms, standards and initiatives that are adaptable to constantly evolving technologies, including the formation of an international body dedicated to cyber issues in outer space that would bring all relevant parties together; and 2) within that framework consider implementing amendments to the space law treaties as a long-term goal.",
