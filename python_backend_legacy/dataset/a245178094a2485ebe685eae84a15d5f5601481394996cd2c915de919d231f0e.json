INTRODUCTION\n\nThis paper discusses the legal issues of protecting satellites in lunar (and other non-earth) orbits from cyberattacks. Lunar satellites are included in the \"cislunar\" space¹ but present special characteristics that differentiate them from the satellites around Earth. This paper focuses on lunar satellites due to the expanding cislunar and lunar economy. This expansion is expected to result in an escalation of cyberrisks for lunar satellites—particularly for commercial ones, which have less robust protection compared to their military counterparts.² Similar to Earth-orbiting satellites³—upon which our economy has come to rely—which are facing growing threats from competitors and adversaries openly expressing their intention to disrupt these satellites in times of conflict,⁴ lunar satellites are likely to face the same threats, with the expansion of the lunar economy.⁵\n\nDue to the limited number of satellites currently orbiting the Moon, this paper analyses the threats faced by Earth's satellites and derives insights applicable to lunar satellites. Potential adversaries are constantly trying to capitalize on perceived weaknesses in space capabilities,⁶ and satellites are exposed to several threats (including physical/kinetic, non-kinetic/physical, electronic, and cyber); however, this paper focuses on\n\n1. 42 U.S.C. § 18302 (defining \"Cis-lunar space\" as \"the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon\").\n2.

This system aims to link lunar assets with Earth across lunar and cislunar spaces.57\n\nLunar activities will rely on satellites in various ways. First, for lunar communication: in order to maintain contact with assets on the lunar surface, lunar satellites will serve as communication relay stations, enabling data transfer, audio/video communication, and command and control of lunar rovers/other equipment.58 Upcoming lunar missions anticipate reliance on emerging cislunar space networks, comprising a special network for communication including relay satellites, orbiters, and spacecraft.59 With the establishment of a stable presence on the Moon, the communication need will be even more pressing. Before its Chang'e-4 mission, China positioned Queqiao, a relay satellite, into a halo orbit beyond the Moon. Its primary objective was to facilitate communication between Earth-based ground stations and the Far Side, where the Chang'e-4 lander would operate.60 To support its Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8, China launched another relay satellite, named Queqiao-2.61\n\nSecond, for navigation and positioning: lunar activities (including landing, navigation, mapping, and mining) will likely use satellite systems like Global Navigation Satellite System (\"GNSS\") or lunar-specific positioning systems to provide accurate location information\n\n56.

A cyberattack—the focus of this paper—is a form of non-kinetic attack being carried out by digital means to compromise, disrupt, or damage data, infrastructure, or communication. The term “cyberattack” has several definitions, including the following: “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident or transiting these systems or networks.” Cyberattacks are performed through malware, hacking, denial-of-service, and other tactics aimed at compromising or disrupting computer systems, networks, and data. A cyberattack can aim at stealing sensitive information, or causing system malfunctions, or blocking the system (unblocking it only after the payment of a sum of money called ransomware).\n\nCyberattacks are not the only possible form of non-kinetic attacks.

Scholars Georgeson and Stubbs explain that satellites are vulnerable due to several factors: (1) they are typically unshielded; (2) they follow predictable orbits, (3) they have limited maneuverability, (4) they are \"few enough in number\" that their destruction could have substantial repercussions; (5) replacing them is costly and consuming; and (6) numerous satellites have dual-use functionality, providing services to the military and to civilians, making them potential targets for enemy attacks.80\n\nNot all of the factors mentioned above are equally relevant to protection against cyberattacks. As for shielding:81 while shielding against destructive attacks like kinetic anti-satellite missiles is difficult, protection against non-kinetic attacks is feasible (e.g., to safeguard against electronic attacks, a shutter shield could protect specific sensors or satellite lids; shielding could be effective against blinding lasers or dazzlers). Shielding satellites against kinetic attacks is not only challenging but also costly, as it increases expenses not only during\n\n76. While different from a cyberattack, spoofing can be used in a cyberattack to trick the system into believing that the source of a cyberattack is a legitimate source.

While development expenses are still a consideration, it is crucial for all satellite operators to create a robust cybersecurity system.\n\nAs for predictability of orbit and fuel scarcity: satellites follow predictable orbits,83 not only due to the laws of physics, but also because they carry limited fuel—which restricts their ability to make significant changes to their orbits. Additionally,84 technical limitations on maneuverability and fuel scarcity result in satellite operators being unable to make rapid maneuvers, even if they detect that an attack is coming.85 Cyberattacks would not be affected by predictability of orbit or limited maneuverability because cyberattacks happen in the \"cyberworld,\" where maneuverability is not necessary; only a robust cybersecurity program is essential.\n\nIn terms of the limited number (i.e., lack of redundancy of satellites), the landscape is swiftly evolving.86 While satellites remain relatively scarce, LEO constellations are significantly altering this scenario in many instances, making lack of redundancy somewhat less impactful. However, this is not universally applicable to every satellite type or operator. In certain instances, operators might not possess hundreds or thousands of satellites performing the same functions; they might have only a few, which play a pivotal role in providing crucial services.87 All things considered, satellites are still relatively few in number.88\n\n82.

Yet, certain operators cannot bear the expenses of development or replacement in the event of satellite destruction.[91] Replacement is not a factor for cyberattack because the damage is generally reversible. If a satellite faces temporary impairment, its functionality could be restored provided the system is properly designed.\n\nIn addition to the above factors, there are factors specific to cyberattacks, such as a lack of system redundancies, the remote nature of satellite operations, and limited or outdated computer resources. Some of the satellites lack system redundancy. System redundancy involves incorporating supplementary components, resources, or elements within a satellite that are not strictly essential for its operation but are included to improve reliability, availability, fault tolerance, and overall robustness.[92] Although redundant systems can still be susceptible to cyberattacks,[93] redundancy could mitigate the risk because, if a component is compromised due to a cyberattack, other components might be capable of fulfilling its functions. Today satellites—at least the larger ones—are designed with redundancy in mind.[94]\n\n[Satellites] are still relatively few in number (so destroying or damaging even a handful could have a major impact); they are \"soft\" (lacking heavy shielding or the ability to defend themselves from attack); they usually follow known, predictable orbital paths, with little ability to undertake evasive maneuvers (so they are easily trackable \"sitting ducks\").\n\nId.\n\n89.

Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks;[95] if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands.[96] Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.[97]\n\nAs for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging.[98] Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.[99]\n\n## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY\n\nSatellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation.[100] Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations.[101] In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite.\n\nConsidering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly.\n\n95.

General Discussion Regarding Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\n\nEven if uncertainties exist, numerous states, including the U.S., hold the view that the current international legal framework adequately governs the conduct of states in cyberspace.¹⁴¹ According to international law, a cyberattack could fall along the spectrum of international responsibility, use of force, and possibly armed attack. The boundaries between these scenarios are not always clearly defined.\n\nInternational responsibility comes into play when there is a violation of an obligation attributable to a state. An international wrongful act—which is a foundational principle in customary international law—causes a novel legal relationship to arise between states when there is a breach of an international obligation by one of them. In fact, the breach triggers a shift from a primary rule—which is a rule dictating state conduct—to a secondary set of rules of responsibility. Article 2 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ARSIWA”)¹⁴² defines an international wrongful act as a conduct—either action or omission—that is contrary to what a State is required to do by international law, including violations of treaties and customary international law, that is attributable to the State. When the breach is attributable to a state, it initiates a new relationship called a “secondary rule,” which evokes legal consequences for the breaching state. Articles 28–36 of ARSIWA outline the legal ramifications of an internationally wrongful act. The legal framework aims to resolve disputes peaceably without escalating to war. It encompasses the obligation of the breaching state to cease the wrongful conduct, prevent its recurrence, rectify the situation, pay damages, or give satisfaction.\n\nRule 14 of the Tallinn Manual (“Internationally wrongful cyber acts”)¹⁴³ provides that a state bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to a state and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation. The focus is on acts that are less severe than the use of force, but still carry international repercussions, such as the obligation to provide reparation.\n\n¹⁴¹ Brian J. Egan, *International Law and Stability in Cyberspace*, 35 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 169, (2017).\n\n¹⁴² GAOR, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf [hereinafter ARSIWA]. While the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts formulated by the International Law Commission (“ILC”), do not possess inherent legal binding force, they do codify principles of customary international law, which are indeed binding. These principles outline guidelines regarding state responsibility.\n\n¹⁴³ See TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 67, and accompanying text.",

Article VI outlines principles that simplify attribution—a challenging aspect in terrestrial contexts. This is confirmed by Rule 60 of the Tallinn Manual, providing (a) that states have a duty of a state to “authorise and supervise the cyber ‘activities in outer space’ of its non-governmental entities,” and (b) that “[c]yber operations involving space objects are subject to the responsibility and liability regime of space law.” However, due to the broadly stated principles and obligations outlined in the OST and the lack specific state practices regarding claims for violating OST duties, the circumstances allowing for an internationally wrongful act concerning breaches of duties on the Moon remain uncertain.¹⁴⁸\n\n144. A cyberattack is not a wrongful act in several circumstances, including when it is the result of self-defense, countermeasures, and necessity. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 19 (“Circumstances precluding wrongfulness of cyber operations”).\n145. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 15 (“Attribution of cyber operations by State organs”). “Cyber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” Id.\n146. ARSIWA Articles 4–11 outline when actions by various entities are seen as acts of a state in international law. Articles 4 and 5 encompass actions by state organs or recognized entities, including authorized individuals yielding governmental authority. Articles 6 and 7 clarify that organs provided by one state to another and actions by state entities, even when exceeding authority, are considered state acts. Articles 8 and 9 define state acts as actions under state control or exercised in the absence of official control, both qualifying as state acts. Articles 10 and 11 address actions of insurrectional movements as state acts, attributing related conduct to those states. Lastly, Article 11 specifies that conduct not directly attributed to a state may be recognized as an act of the state if acknowledged and adopted. See also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, Rule 17 (“Attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors”). “Cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control; or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own.” Id.\n147.

Ireland also stated that countermeasures do not need to mirror the original action but must be proportionate and non-forceful. Peculiar aspects of the Irish position are the stipulation that countermeasures must be of a temporary nature and the express recognition that third-party collective countermeasures are permitted (particularly in the context of violation of peremptory norms).¹⁵⁹ Therefore, Ireland directly sided with the Tallinn Manual.¹⁶⁰\n\n## 2.

This paper does not intend to delve into the accuracy of the statement concerning matters of love, but certainly the expression is quite wrong for wars, which are far from being unregulated in international law. In fact, armed conflicts are governed by two distinct bodies of law. The first governs the initiation of an armed conflict (ius ad bellum).^[189]^ The second governs the conduct of hostilities (ius in bello). This second body of law is also known as laws of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") or as international humanitarian law (\"IHL\").\n\n## A. PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

The existence of an “armed attack” is essential for justifying the use of force in self-defense, making it an integral part of the ius ad bellum. Also, when an “armed conflict” occurs, it activates for the belligerents the application of the ius in bello.¹⁹¹\n\nArticle 2.4 of the UN Charter¹⁹² provides that “[a]ll Members must abstain from the threat or use of force in their international relations against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This provision establishes the principle of non-aggression, rendering the use of force, threats of force, including acts of aggression and military interventions, illegal against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence. Notably, it also prohibits any use or threat of force that contradicts the United Nations’ purposes. Three instances exist where the prohibition of use of force within or against another state is lawful: (1) that state’s consent; (2) authorization from the UN Security Council; and (3) individual or collective self-defense.¹⁹³\n\nThis paper does not discuss the topic of states’ consent¹⁹⁴ or the UN Security Council’s authorization;¹⁹⁵ and it focuses on the right of self-defense, as specifically relevant to a reaction to a cyberattack on a satellite. Self-defense is a principle of customary international law, which is also recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter, which qualifies it as “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.”¹⁹⁶ This right exists whether exercised individually or collectively by states (as under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty).¹⁹⁷ Under the principle of self-defense, a state is allowed to employ force when confronted with an “armed attack.” Nevertheless, the pivotal issue lies in the definition of an “armed attack,” which ultimately determines the applicability of the right to self-defense.¹⁹⁸\n\nThe UN Charter does not provide a specific definition for the term “armed attack,” and records from the UN Charter’s drafters provide no definitive explanation of the term.¹⁹⁹ Scholars suggest that the inexplicit definition of “armed attack” may exist because the concept was thought to be self-evident. The drafters and negotiators consistently viewed aggression as the catalyst for justifiable self-defense. They\n\n191. Blank, supra note 189, at 250.\n192. U.N. CHARTER, supra note 12.\n193.

In an initial draft presented by the U.S. to the Five Powers (China, France, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom), it was stated that if the Security Council failed to prevent aggression and it occurred against any member state, that state had an inherent right to take necessary self-defense measures. During that era, two treaties, the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance and Solidarity and the Pact of the League of Arab States, also equated aggression with attack.²⁰⁰\n\nIn general, scholars consider an “armed attack” as being more severe and significant than a mere use of force indicating that an action could amount to use of force without reaching the level of an “armed attack.” The distinction between forms of force that qualifies as “armed attacks” and actions that imply the use of force, but fall short of being an “armed attack” is unclear, even if some guidance is offered by the international case law.²⁰¹ Particularly important is the Nicaragua case,²⁰² which adopts the “scale and effects” test to judge whether particular hostile actions directed at a state reach the level of an “armed attack.” The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) specified, for instance, that an event as minor as a “border incident” does not qualify as an “armed attack.”²⁰³ Along the same lines, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission²⁰⁴ determined that “geographically limited clashes” in a “remote, unmarked, and disputed border” were not enough to be considered an “armed attack.” Likewise, “localized border encounters” involving “small infantry units,” even resulting “in loss of life” are not an “armed attack.”²⁰⁵ The Nicaragua case clarified that sending regular armed forces across a border or using irregular militias generally constitutes an armed attack. However, providing weapons to rebels across borders does not meet the threshold. The physical impact of an action—including evaluation of the territorial intrusion, casualties, or significant property damage—is a key consideration.

However, in the Oil Platforms case,²⁰⁶ the court ruled that “the mining of a single military vessel could be sufficient to meet the definition of an ‘armed attack.’”²⁰⁷\n\nAs discussed, at the United Nation San Francisco Conference of 1945, aggression was considered as the trigger for legitimate self-defense, specifically recognizing “armed attack” as a severe and separate form of aggression.²⁰⁸ For this reason, non-binding UN Resolution 3314 of the 1974 (“Definition of Aggression”)²⁰⁹ remains relevant for defining the term “armed attack.” Article I provides that “[a]ggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition.” Article II provides that “the First use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression” (unless the UN Security Council determines otherwise) while Article III goes on to list some examples of acts of aggression—like invasion, bombardment, blockade of ports, sending troops or mercenaries in another state, et cetera.²¹⁰\n\nThis paper will not delve any further on the general concept of “armed attack,”²¹¹ the previous discussion should adequately convey the complexity of this concept, which becomes even more challenging when applied to cyberattacks.

APPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF “ARMED ATTACK” TO CYBERATTACKS\n\nIn modern conflicts, cyberattacks can disrupt critical information assets, communications, and weapons systems. Cyberattacks can also cause political disruption by targeting finance, energy, transportation, and government services, thus creating social unrest.²¹⁴ In sum, a cyberattack can inflict damage well beyond that of a single bombardment.²¹⁵ Can a cyberattack be classified as \"an armed attack\" under the UN Charter?²¹⁶ Our discussion centers on cyberattacks existing independently of larger warfare contexts, such as the Ukrainian war.²¹⁷ The focus is on singular or multiple cyberattacks that, devoid of any other military actions, could be perceived as acts of aggression against national security.\n\nThe possibility for a cyberattack to rise to the level of an \"armed attack\" relevant under the UN Charter is the object of some debate. This paper takes the position that a satellite cyberattack can constitute—in\n\nthe sinking of an American steamboat (Caroline) used by Canadian insurgents, on orders of the British, caused a famous exchange of letters between United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British representative Lord Ashburton. *Id.* That correspondence is referred to as establishing the elements of the customary international right of self-defense. Webster wrote to Ashburton: \"Under these circumstances, and under those immediately connected with the transaction itself, it will be for her majesty's government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of national law, the destruction of the 'Caroline' is to be defended. It will be for that government to show a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" *Id.*\n\n²¹³. This paper does not discuss another self-defense restriction: a state invoking self-defense, must quickly inform the UN Security Council.

According to several scholars, cyberattacks can rise to the level of “armed attacks” as the UN Charter’s regulation regarding the use of force can be expanded to encompass cyberattacks conducted by one state against another through interpretative means. Several states share this position. For example, the United Kingdom asserted that, under specific circumstances, a cyberattack can be considered the equivalent of an “armed attack” triggering the right of self-defense. Ireland has adopted the “scale and effect” test, stating that use of force “may include instances where a cyber-operation does not cause physical damages such as where there is significant impairment of functionality of critical infrastructure.” “The circumstances under which non-injurious and non-destructive cyber operations might reach the use of force threshold remains a point of uncertainty among States.” However, only in “exceptional circumstances” could a cyber operation “reach this threshold.”²¹⁸ France asserted that the threshold for the use of force in cyberspace is not solely determined by the digital tools employed, but by the impact of the cyber operation itself. If the effects of a cyber operation resemble those of traditional weaponry, it breaches the prohibition on using force between states.²¹⁹ France acknowledges that even without physical consequences, a cyber operation could qualify as a use of force, in case of severe economic cyber impacts.²²⁰ France also declared the need to evaluate several criteria, including the operation’s origin, instigator’s nature, intrusion level, intended effects, and target, determines this assessment.²²¹ Singapore proclaimed that the factors to consider are several, including the context during the cyber operation, its origin, the intended or actual impact, the level of intrusion, and the characteristics of the target.²²² Singapore and Norway also recognized the possibility of severe economic cyber impacts being seen as an “armed attack.”²²³\n\nBeyond general views expressed on the topic as discussed above, there are no official statements from states regarding specific instances of cyberattacks.

While it would seem generally accepted that, akin to physical conflicts, nations possess an inherent right to self-defense in the event of cyberattacks, the boundary of this right remains uncertain in international law, especially on whether the use of force is justified in response to a cyberattack.²³²\n\n1. Rule 51 (Self-defence against armed attack) Application to Cyberattacks\n\nWhile Article 51 UN Charter broadly encompasses various forms of attacks, including cyberattacks, the Tallinn Manual appropriately clarifies that a state targeted by a cyberattack maintains the right to self-defense. Rule 71 (“Self-defence against armed attack”) provides: “A State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”²³³ Some states have taken a stance on the right of self-defense in the case of cyberattacks. In 2018, the United Kingdom released the following statement: “It is clear that cyber operations that result in, or present an imminent threat of, death and destruction on an equivalent scale to an armed attack will give rise to an inherent right to take action in self-defence, as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.”²³⁴ The United Kingdom firmly believes that cyber operations leading to, or posing an immediate risk of, severe harm or destruction comparable to an “armed attack” warrant the inherent right to respond in self-defense, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.²³⁵ Canada also recognizes “that the inherent right of self-defence if an ‘armed attack’ occurs against a state also applies in cyberspace.”²³⁶\n\n230.

Rule 73 (“Imminence and immediacy”) of the Tallinn Manual provides, “[t]he right to use force in self-defense arises if a cyber armed attack occurs or is imminent. It is further subject to a requirement of immediacy.”²⁴² This paper also discussed how proportionality and necessity are also an issue in self-defense.²⁴³ Just as with a physical attack, the response of a targeted state to a cyberattack must align with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, the state is allowed only to take actions necessary to halt the attack or prevent additional ones. Rule 72 (“Necessity and proportionality”) of the Tallinn Manual provides “[a] use of force involving cyber operations undertaken by a State in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate.”²⁴⁴\n\nAs the scope of a legitimate self-defense in cyberspace is debatable, afflicted countries are generally cautious when responding to cyberattacks due to the potential for escalation. Typically, diplomatic avenues are prioritized over immediate military or cyber counterattacks in retaliation.

Ius in Bello and Its Application to Satellite Cyberattacks\n\nThe *ius in bello* governs the conduct of the hostilities, and has evolved over centuries. The *jus in bello* includes the laws of armed conflict (“LOAC”), alternatively known as international humanitarian law (“IHL”).²⁴⁶ This paper takes the position that IHL applies to conflicts in outer space,²⁴⁷ considering that the ICJ held that the IHL “applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future.”²⁴⁸ Consistent is the Tallinn Manual, which unambiguously provides that “[c]yber operations executed in the context of an armed conflict are subject to the law of armed conflict.”²⁴⁹ However, contrary opinions exist.²⁵⁰ There is limited discourse on applying IHL to satellites in lunar or other celestial bodies’ orbits, which is not surprising considering the early stage of the lunar economy and the presence of only a few satellites around the Moon. However, once the principle of IHL applying in outer space is accepted, there is no reason to restrict IHL application to Earth’s orbits.\n\nThis paper only briefly outlines IHL principles and examines their application in space, specifically focusing on satellites. The following discussion will briefly cover: (1) military necessity; (2) distinction; (3) proportionality; (4) precautions; (5) the principle of constant care; and (6) the principle of avoiding widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment. Military necessity mandates that any action in an international armed conflict must be justified as necessary to gain a clear military advantage.²⁵¹ Distinction requires a clear differentiation between civilians and combatants, as well as civilian and military objectives with operations directed solely at military objects.²⁵² Military objectives are those contributing to military action through their nature, location, purpose, or use, and when their (partial or total) destruction, capture, or neutralization provides a clear military advantage.²⁵³ Rule 93 of the Tallinn Manual clarifies that\n\n246.

However, some consider its application to space a logical conclusion.²⁷² If this principle applies to space, it discourages kinetic satellite destruction due to the debris. Attackers might prefer terrestrial or non-kinetic methods like cyberattacks. The Tallinn Manual contains specific provisions for the protection of important installations, of “objects indispensable to survival,” and of the natural environment in general.²⁷³\n\nThis paper does not discuss international human rights law (IHRL), which in certain cases (states’ exercising power or control) could extend beyond a state’s territory, potentially reaching outer space where no sovereignty exists.²⁷⁴ Though not the main focus, IHRL factors like necessity, proportionality, precautions, and investigations are likely to impact decisions on satellite attacks, including cyberattacks.²⁷⁵ Applying IHRL to space raises concerns about potential violations of the right to life if individuals are killed through satellite targeting.²⁷⁶\n\nIn conclusion, satellite cyberattacks generally adhere to most IHL principles, except potentially the principle of proportionality.²⁷⁷ The significant repercussions of destroying certain satellites, like the GPS system, may pose challenges due to their impact on the broader civilian population, potentially violating the principle of proportionality.

This raises concerns about the compatibility of such actions with the established framework of IHL. Furthermore, the growing lunar economy and increased human presence on the Moon will magnify the significance of IHRL concerns.

However, this paper takes the position that the principles of *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* are “the *lex specialis* during armed conflict and prevail over the general law of outer space.”²⁷⁹ Several provisions potentially impact the issue of cyberattacks on lunar satellites. First, Article II of the OST, which likely aimed at preventing the “colonization” of outer space,²⁸⁰ and which specifies, “[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”²⁸¹ The prevailing view asserts that this non-appropriation principle applies to both States and private\n\n²⁷⁸.

This provision establishes a form of jurisdiction similar to the concept of a “flag” state, resembling territorial control over the registered space object\n\n282. See, e.g., Ricky J. Lee, Article II of the Outer Space Treaty: Prohibition of State Sovereignty, Private Property Rights, or Both, 11 AUSTL.

Thus, generally accepted rules and principles, such as the prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defense, would also be in force in outer space. Id. OST, supra note 17, at Art.

The only difference is that in Space Law, inclusion in the national registry does not confer nationality de jure to the spacecraft, only jurisdiction and control thereon.

Similarly, a State can request consultations if it believes another country’s space actions might disrupt peaceful space exploration.

In providing that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used . . . exclusively for peaceful purposes,” the provision would seem to exclude the possibility to militarily defend the assets. Even assuming that this provision does indeed pertain to orbital regions, this provision should not be construed as limiting the right of self-defense. First, the right of self-defense is a well-established norm of customary international law, solidified in Article 51 UN Charter. Its significance and authority are unlikely to be susceptible to influence by a provision framed in such broadly general terms as Article IV(2). Therefore, the right of self-defense must exist in outer space (contrary views exist).³⁰¹ Second, in case of an armed conflict, ius ad bellum and ius in bello are lex specialix that prevail the OST. Article 103 of the UN Charter provides that in cases where members of the United Nations have conflicting obligations under the current Charter and other international agreements, the obligations under the UN Charter shall prevail.³⁰² Third, the term “peaceful” under Article IV(2) should be interpreted as “non-aggressive” and not “as non-military.”³⁰³ The term “peaceful” also appears in the Preamble, Article IX, and Article XI. However, it is only in Article IV(2) that the term “peaceful” is paired with “exclusively,” creating a distinct regulatory emphasis on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Some scholars have pointed out that this is significant to give a special regime to the Moon and other celestial bodies, no matter how the term “peaceful” is interpreted within the OST, the crucial point lies in how Article IV(2) combines it with the term “exclusively.”³⁰⁴\n\n301. This contrary view states that self-defense on celestial bodies is limited by Article IV OST. See, e.g., Arjen Vermeer, The Laws of War in Outer Space: Some Legal Implications for the Jus ad Bellum and the Jus in Bello of the Militarisation and Weaponisation of Outer Space, in THE NEW ORDER OF WAR (2010) at 6 (arguing that “Article IV OST precludes offensive and defensive military activity on celestial bodies”). See also Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 354 (citing authorities that question the applicability of the right of self-defense in outer space).\n\n302. While Article 103 talks of “obligations” and not “rights” under the convention, because Article 51 is complementary to Article 2.4 (ban on use of force and threat thereof), Article 103 should be read as to make Article 51 prevail over inconsistent provisions, too. Different interpretations are possible.\n\n303. See, e.g., Matthew G. Looper, International Space Law: How Russia and the U.S. are at Odds in the Final Frontier, 18 S.C. J. INT’L.

Contrary view exists. See, e.g., Vermeer supra note 301.\n\n304. Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 340 (arguing that the combination of these terms holds significance, as the provision specifies that the moon and other celestial bodies should be utilized “exclusively for peaceful purposes only,” not “exclusively peaceful purposes”). This wording clarifies that any activity remains lawful as long as it maintains peaceful intent; however, once non-peaceful aspects are introduced, its legality is forfeited. In essence, the moon and other celestial bodies are intended to remain devoid of any military utilization. Id. See also, Marko G. Markoff, Disarmament and Peaceful",

Although interpreting Article IV(2) in accordance with established interpretation principles necessitates considering the adverb \"exclusively,\"[305] the presence of the adverb \"exclusively\" does not alter the fact that the UN Charter (and the inherent right of self-defense) takes precedence over the OST. In addition, \"peaceful\" should be interpreted as \"non-agressive\" and state practice reflects this interpretation.[306] Since the 1950s, space has been utilized for military purposes, carrying a national security implication. Space was initially employed for reconnaissance and then predominantly in a passive capacity during the Cold War. During the Cold War, space was also used for nuclear capability assessments and as national technical means for verification of the non-proliferation treaties.[307] In sum, the military usage of space gradually broadened.[308] Overall, the utilization of space for military purposes expanded over time. It was with the Gulf War in the 1990s, often termed the inaugural \"space war,\" that space assets were actively employed for military operations within a theater of war.[309]\n\nAlso, the second part of Article IV(2) poses no hindrance to the deterrence and defense of lunar satellites. It explicitly prohibits the utilization of celestial bodies for military bases, weapon testing, and military maneuvers. Arguably, deterrence and protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks are unlikely to necessitate the establishment\n\nPurposes Provisions in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, Spring 1976, Number 1, at 3, 16 (internal quotation omitted) (arguing that \"this use . . . excludes all kinds of military, and not only warlike activities on planets other than the Earth\"); Bin Cheng, Properly Speaking, Only Celestial Bodies Have Been Reserved for Use Exclusively for Peaceful (Non-Military) Purposes, but Not Outer Void Space, 75 INT'L.

The advocates for the theory that the presence of the adverb \"exclusively\" would mean complete demilitarization of the Moon, also point out to the Antarctica treaty that contains that same language and is \"commonly understood as meaning a complete demilitarization of Antarctica.\" See, e.g., COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287 at 82.\n\n306.

However, if that were the case, the two explicitly stated exceptions to this provision would come into play. As mentioned, these exceptions are as follows: (1) “[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,” and (2) “[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.” Either of these exceptions provides ample flexibility to permit deterrence and protection of lunar satellites. In fact, the satellites slated for deployment around the Moon, at least initially, will serve “scientific research or other peaceful purposes,” such as experiments and enabling lunar mining. An argument can be constructed, therefore, that the deployment of “military personnel” essential for deterring and defending these satellites should fall under this exception. Additionally, under the second exception, the use of any equipment or facility necessary for deterring attacks on and safeguarding these satellites should also be permissible, even if generally prohibited by the overarching provision of the latter part of Article IV(2) because at least initially the lunar satellites will be “necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon.”\n\nFurthermore, this paper argues that Article IV(2) exclusively applies to the Moon and celestial bodies themselves and does not encompass lunar orbits (as well as the orbits of other planets).[310] Lunar orbits and similar regions can be arguably considered part of empty outer space, exclusively covered by Article IV(1). Consequently, if the need for military defense against cyberattacks on lunar satellites were to arise, it would be legal to station military personnel and equipment in the vicinity of the Moon or lunar orbit (as opposed to the lunar surface). There are several reasons why Article IV(2) does not extend to these orbits. First, the general principle is that Article I of the OST's freedom of use applies to \"empty outer space,\"[311] while the regulation of celestial bodies is the exception. Given that Article IV(2) contains an exception to a general principle, it should be narrowly construed. Second, at least some orbits (i.e., Earth's orbit) have been used \"militarily\" since the inception of the space age, and no state has significantly objected to that use.[312] Therefore, state practice supports the argument that orbits are empty outer space and are not covered by Article IV(2).

Given that an expansive interpretation of Article IV(2) would pose a substantial obstacle to the exercise of the right of self-defense (in essence, potentially hindering any military protection of lunar installations), it is advisable not to construe Article IV(2) broadly to encompass lunar orbits. Fourth, the Moon Agreement, which holds limited direct significance today, can serve as a valuable tool when used ex contrario to offer insights for interpreting the OST.314 This approach suggests that if the Moon Agreement addresses a particular issue, it may indicate that the OST does not encompass that specific aspect. This is notably applicable to Article 1(2) of the Moon Agreement, which explicitly includes \"orbits around or other trajectories to or around it\" in the Moon's definition, and Article 3 of the Moon Agreement, which provides a more detailed framework for regulating military activities on the Moon.315 Extending the Moon's governance structure to lunar orbit based on the\n\n313.

Article 3 of the Moon Agreement provides:\n1. The moon shall be used by all States Parties exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n2. Any threat or use of force or any other hostile act or threat of hostile act on the moon is prohibited. It is likewise prohibited to use the moon in order to commit any such act or to engage in any such threat in relation to the earth, the moon, spacecraft, the personnel of spacecraft or man-made space objects.\n3.

The Other Space Treaties\n\nAfter the OST was enacted in 1967, several other significant treaties were signed between 1968 and 1976. These treaties, namely the Rescue Agreement,³¹⁶ Liability Convention,³¹⁷ and Registration Convention,³¹⁸ also pertain to Moon activities and Moon satellites. None of these treaties are highly pertinent to the subject of this paper, except for the Liability Convention, which could be relevant if a cyber-attack results in measurable damage for which the victim-state seeks compensation.\n\nIn 1979—the Moon Agreement was signed³¹⁹—and it could have had the potential to significantly influence the subject of this paper. However, this treaty ultimately failed due to the limited number of ratifications. Therefore, while differing opinions exist,³²⁰ this paper contends that the dismissal of the Moon Agreement by the vast majority of states³²¹ (including all major space-faring nations except India and Australia) renders it largely irrelevant for our analysis. However, as previously discussed, it can still serve a purpose when employed in a contrasting manner to enhance our understanding of the interpretation of OST. In other words, if the Moon Agreement found it necessary to address a particular issue, it implies that the OST does not cover that aspect.\n\n### 2.

The Artemis Accords are firmly rooted in the OST and emerged as a response to the need for a clearer framework for space activities.³²⁴ While they do not specifically address the defense of lunar satellites (or any other lunar assets), they emphasize cooperation, transparency, and sustainability.³²⁵\n\nTwo provisions are particularly important for the topic of this paper. Section 5 (“Interoperability”) provides that the Signatories acknowledge that the use of compatible and shared exploration infrastructure and standards (including standard for communication systems) advances exploration, scientific research, and commercial utilization. Therefore the Signatories commit to strive to employ existing interoperability standards, or to create new standards when current ones are absent or insufficient. Interoperability enhances cybersecurity³²⁶ and therefore, by providing this commitment, the Artemis Accords significantly increase protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks. Section 11 (“Deconfliction of Space Activities”), and in particular, Sections 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 are relevant. First, in Section 11.1, the Signatories reconfirm their commitment to the OST with alignment on provisions such as due regard and prevention of harmful interference. Second, in Section 11.3 the Signatories reaffirm the commitment to use due regard, as per Article IX of the OST. Section 11.3 also provides that if a Signatory fears or has suffered harmful interference, that Signatory can initiate a consultation with the other Signatory that authorized the activity (or any party to the OST). Lastly, Section 11.4 commits the Signatories to avoid deliberate actions that could lead to harmful interference with each other’s utilization of outer space.

If deterrence fails, the right to self-defense is invoked in accordance with international law and treaty obligations.[334] The 2011 NSSS specified that, although the U.S. believes that all space-faring nations should strive to prevent space hostilities, it acknowledges that some actors might still see military advantage in space-based actions.[335] In 2018, the Trump Administration issued the U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy,[336] and instituted the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency.[337] Specifically on cybersecurity for space, the Trump Administration issued Space Policy Directive 5 - Cybersecurity Principles for Space System (\"SPD-5\"), which focused on cybersecurity for space systems and urged federal agencies and non-governmental space operators to establish cybersecurity norms.[338]\n\nIn 2020, the National Space Policy (\"2020 NSP\")[339] reaffirmed the right of self-defense providing that if any adversary jeopardizes the advantages that the U.S. gains from space, the U.S. will use all means to deter and, if needed, overcome hostile actions in space.

However, with the growth of the lunar economy, a more concentrated emphasis on the Moon is advised.\n\n## B. NATO’s POSITION\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), established in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty,³⁶⁵ is a political and military alliance created as a collective defense organization among North American and European countries, totaling thirty-two members.³⁶⁶ Collective defense is NATO’s bedrock: NATO members pledge to consider an attack against any of its members as an attack against all, triggering a duty to respond collectively.³⁶⁷ Equally significant is the aspect of defense planning, meaning that the members collaborate on planning their defense and developing military capabilities against security challenges. Also crucial is the aspect of cooperative security, which means that NATO cooperates with non-member countries and international organizations to promote security and stability, such as conventional military threats, terrorism, and hybrid warfare, and cyberattacks.\n\nTo comprehend NATO’s stance on cyberattacks targeting satellites, it is essential to recognize that the matter resides at the intersection of NATO’s position on satellite defense and its response to cyberattacks. NATO has been increasingly focused on protecting and defending its members’ satellites, considering that satellites are crucial to communication, navigation, reconnaissance, and military operations. In 2019, NATO officially recognized space as an operational domain “alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace.”³⁶⁸\n\n---\n\n³⁶⁴.

Both satellites and ground-based facilities are potential targets for these threats.371 NATO's goal is not to become an independent space player,372 but to enhance and contribute to the efforts of its member states and collaborate with other pertinent international organizations.373 This includes enhancing space domain awareness374 in cooperation with space agencies and advancing counter-space capabilities and technologies for safeguarding space assets, including cybersecurity defense.\n\nNATO has reaffirmed its long-standing belief that cyberspace is continuously contested by various state and non-state actors.375 Most notably, NATO's robust engagement in cyber defense and the role of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (\"CCDCOE\") are evidenced by the Tallinn Manual.376 An important example of NATO's approach regarding a specific cyberattack exists.

Estonia invoked Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, alleging an attack by Russia. However, NATO determined that the events did not meet the threshold of an “armed attack,” reflecting an effects-based approach to assessing cyberattacks. Referring to UN Charter Article 51, NATO concluded that Russia’s actions did not qualify as an “armed attack,” and therefore, the right to self-defense for NATO member states did not come into effect.³⁷⁷\n\nIt is challenging to predict what NATO would do in case of a cyberattack on the Moon because it is a vastly different environment compared to Earth, and the impact of a cyberattack on a satellite or group of satellites may vary significantly. Also, on the Moon a cyberattack could be more impactful (due to the scarcity of satellites) or less impactful (due to the limited number of people affected). However, one could make a reasonable argument that if NATO did not view the extensive 2007 cyberattack in Estonia as meeting the criteria for a cyberattack requiring collective self-defense, it would be even more unlikely for NATO to categorize an attack on a lunar satellite in that way.\n\n## C.

CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper has delved into the issue of cyber-threats for satellites in non-Earth orbits, particularly in lunar orbits, amid escalating cyber-risks. The growing cislunar and lunar economy will heighten vulnerability, especially for commercial lunar satellites lacking robust protection. Just as Earth-orbiting satellites have faced increasing threats, lunar satellites will be confronted with similar risks in the expanding lunar economy. With a limited number of satellites orbiting the Moon, this paper has drawn insights from threats facing Earth's satellites to anticipate risks for lunar counterparts, focusing specifically on cyberthreats. Cyberthreats pose unique challenges due to attribution complexities and scope of the right of self-defense. This paper has examined cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and as armed attacks, assessing affected states' rights to self-defense. Considering provisions in the UN Charter and the OST, this paper has concluded that Article IV of the OST cannot be interpreted as impeding the right of self-defense of lunar satellites. Even if certain restrictions exist, this paper has argued that the right of self-defense would prevail when constrained by these limitations. Preserving security for both government and commercial satellites remains crucial for U.S. national interests, and it will become paramount on the Moon as well. The recognition that the right of self-defense is not diminished in space is an important component of satellite security.\n\n³⁹³. Dong L.

Highlighting the intricate nature of cyber threats and their impact on both governmental and commercial satellites, this paper examines cyberattacks as potential international wrongful acts and armed attacks. This paper evaluates the right of affected states to self-defense and scrutinizes Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty (\"OST\"), alongside other pertinent treaties' provisions. This paper concludes that Article IV of the OST should not be interpreted as to impede the right of self-defense for lunar satellites, and claims that the inherent right of self-defense overrides the OST's restrictions, allowing for protection for lunar satellite assets.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n665\n# I. INTRODUCTION\nThis paper discusses the legal issues of protecting satellites in lunar (and other non-earth) orbits from cyberattacks. Lunar satellites are included in the \"cislunar\" space¹ but present special characteristics that differentiate them from the satellites around Earth. This paper focuses on lunar satellites due to the expanding cislunar and lunar economy. This expansion is expected to result in an escalation of cyberrisks for lunar satellites—particularly for commercial ones, which have less robust protection compared to their military counterparts.² Similar to Earth-orbiting satellites³—upon which our economy has come to rely—which are facing growing threats from competitors and adversaries openly expressing their intention to disrupt these satellites in times of conflict,⁴ lunar satellites are likely to face the same threats, with the expansion of the lunar economy.⁵\nDue to the limited number of satellites currently orbiting the Moon, this paper analyses the threats faced by Earth's satellites and derives insights applicable to lunar satellites. Potential adversaries are constantly trying to capitalize on perceived weaknesses in space capabilities,⁶ and satellites are exposed to several threats (including physical/kinetic, non-kinetic/physical, electronic, and cyber); however, this paper focuses on\n1. 42 U.S.C. § 18302 (defining \"Cis-lunar space\" as \"the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon\").\n2.

Preserving the security of both governmental and commercial satellites is essential for the United States national interests.¹⁰\nThis paper will discuss in Part III(E) and Part IV, respectively, cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and cyberattacks as “armed attacks.”¹¹ In both cases, the affected state has a right to react, albeit with differing degrees of severity. Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)¹² prohibits use of force or threat thereof.¹³ Self-defense (including collective self-defense as in the North Atlantic Treaty)¹⁴ stands as an exception as per Article 51 of the UN Charter, incorporating a fundamental principle within customary international law.¹⁵ This paper examines if a cyberattack qualifies as use of force, granting affected states the right to countermeasures, and, if the cyberattack escalates to an armed attack, whether self-defense permits the use of force or threat thereof.¹⁶\nThe Preamble of the Outer Space Treaty (“OST”)¹⁷ frames exploration and use of space as an aspirational principle. However, “peaceful purposes” is not defined by the OST.¹⁸ Article IV of the OST—which is a rare instance in which the Moon and other celestial bodies are treated separately and distinct from the empty outer space—is the\n7. Erwin, supra note 4.\n8. The level of attribution varies, with the kinetic/physical attacks being the easiest to attribute, followed by the non-kinetic physical ones, with the electronic and cyber having the most difficult attribution. The issue of attribution is very challenging in cybersecurity. First, technical attribution is difficult. Second, even if technical attribution is possible, the problem of legal attribution remains.\n9. U.N.G.A.

This system aims to link lunar assets with Earth across lunar and cislunar spaces.57\nLunar activities will rely on satellites in various ways. First, for lunar communication: in order to maintain contact with assets on the lunar surface, lunar satellites will serve as communication relay stations, enabling data transfer, audio/video communication, and command and control of lunar rovers/other equipment.58 Upcoming lunar missions anticipate reliance on emerging cislunar space networks, comprising a special network for communication including relay satellites, orbiters, and spacecraft.59 With the establishment of a stable presence on the Moon, the communication need will be even more pressing. Before its Chang'e-4 mission, China positioned Queqiao, a relay satellite, into a halo orbit beyond the Moon. Its primary objective was to facilitate communication between Earth-based ground stations and the Far Side, where the Chang'e-4 lander would operate.60 To support its Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8, China launched another relay satellite, named Queqiao-2.61\nSecond, for navigation and positioning: lunar activities (including landing, navigation, mapping, and mining) will likely use satellite systems like Global Navigation Satellite System (\"GNSS\") or lunar-specific positioning systems to provide accurate location information\n56.

SELECTED EXAMPLES OF SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\nSatellite hacking has occurred on multiple occasions.⁷⁰ In 2011, the U.S. issued a report, revealing that cyber-intruders (possibly connected to Chinese military groups) had disrupted the operations of two U.S. government satellites on four separate occasions in the previous years.⁷¹ Troubling incidents of cyberattacks have happened in connection with the Ukrainian War. Immediately prior the invasion, Russia initiated a massive cyberattack against ViaSat, a satellite company, disabling and infecting all the ground modems responsible for transmitting signals to/from the satellites, rendering the systems inoperable.⁷² The attack impacted not only Ukraine (which used ViaSat for military communication) but also other Central and Eastern European nations,\n68.

Amtel-Svyaz, the parent company of Dozor, acted swiftly, taking control of one network while three remained down. Dozor-Teleport did not disclose specific attack details, and it is unclear whether the terrestrial network was affected or the satellites themselves. A self-proclaimed “hacktivist” organization and a branch of the Wagner Group both claimed responsibility, asserting that they sent malicious software to the satellite terminals.74 In 2022, Elon Musk revealed that SpaceX’s Starlink satellites had been subjected to numerous cyberattacks in the wake of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.75\n## B. WHY SATELLITES ARE PARTICULARLY EASY TARGETS FOR CYBERATTACKS\nA satellite could be attacked kinetically or non-kinetically. “Kinetic” means actions involving physical force or direct contact, such as bombings and other types of attacks that cause physical damage, while “non-kinetic” attacks are those that do not involve a direct physical force. A cyberattack—the focus of this paper—is a form of non-kinetic attack being carried out by digital means to compromise, disrupt, or damage data, infrastructure, or communication. The term “cyberattack” has several definitions, including the following: “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident or transiting these systems or networks.” Cyberattacks are performed through malware, hacking, denial-of-service, and other tactics aimed at compromising or disrupting computer systems, networks, and data. A cyberattack can aim at stealing sensitive information, or causing system malfunctions, or blocking the system (unblocking it only after the payment of a sum of money called ransomware).\nCyberattacks are not the only possible form of non-kinetic attacks. Spoofing (use of deceptive or fraudulent electronic data or communications to deceive, manipulate a system, or disguise the attacker’s\n73.

Scholars Georgeson and Stubbs explain that satellites are vulnerable due to several factors: (1) they are typically unshielded; (2) they follow predictable orbits, (3) they have limited maneuverability, (4) they are \"few enough in number\" that their destruction could have substantial repercussions; (5) replacing them is costly and consuming; and (6) numerous satellites have dual-use functionality, providing services to the military and to civilians, making them potential targets for enemy attacks.80\nNot all of the factors mentioned above are equally relevant to protection against cyberattacks. As for shielding:81 while shielding against destructive attacks like kinetic anti-satellite missiles is difficult, protection against non-kinetic attacks is feasible (e.g., to safeguard against electronic attacks, a shutter shield could protect specific sensors or satellite lids; shielding could be effective against blinding lasers or dazzlers). Shielding satellites against kinetic attacks is not only challenging but also costly, as it increases expenses not only during\n76. While different from a cyberattack, spoofing can be used in a cyberattack to trick the system into believing that the source of a cyberattack is a legitimate source. For example, in a phishing attack, attackers may use email spoofing to make an email appear as though it comes from a trusted source.

While development expenses are still a consideration, it is crucial for all satellite operators to create a robust cybersecurity system.\nAs for predictability of orbit and fuel scarcity: satellites follow predictable orbits,83 not only due to the laws of physics, but also because they carry limited fuel—which restricts their ability to make significant changes to their orbits. Additionally,84 technical limitations on maneuverability and fuel scarcity result in satellite operators being unable to make rapid maneuvers, even if they detect that an attack is coming.85 Cyberattacks would not be affected by predictability of orbit or limited maneuverability because cyberattacks happen in the \"cyberworld,\" where maneuverability is not necessary; only a robust cybersecurity program is essential.\nIn terms of the limited number (i.e., lack of redundancy of satellites), the landscape is swiftly evolving.86 While satellites remain relatively scarce, LEO constellations are significantly altering this scenario in many instances, making lack of redundancy somewhat less impactful. However, this is not universally applicable to every satellite type or operator. In certain instances, operators might not possess hundreds or thousands of satellites performing the same functions; they might have only a few, which play a pivotal role in providing crucial services.87 All things considered, satellites are still relatively few in number.88\n82.

Stating:\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n677\nSatellites often lack security components;[89] Koplow contends that many satellites do not possess onboard sensors for local situational awareness, potentially leaving them unaware of any attacks or their sources.[90] Constellations influence the replacement factor by maintaining a continuous turnover of satellites. Yet, certain operators cannot bear the expenses of development or replacement in the event of satellite destruction.[91] Replacement is not a factor for cyberattack because the damage is generally reversible. If a satellite faces temporary impairment, its functionality could be restored provided the system is properly designed.\nIn addition to the above factors, there are factors specific to cyberattacks, such as a lack of system redundancies, the remote nature of satellite operations, and limited or outdated computer resources. Some of the satellites lack system redundancy. System redundancy involves incorporating supplementary components, resources, or elements within a satellite that are not strictly essential for its operation but are included to improve reliability, availability, fault tolerance, and overall robustness.[92] Although redundant systems can still be susceptible to cyberattacks,[93] redundancy could mitigate the risk because, if a component is compromised due to a cyberattack, other components might be capable of fulfilling its functions. Today satellites—at least the larger ones—are designed with redundancy in mind.[94]\n[Satellites] are still relatively few in number (so destroying or damaging even a handful could have a major impact); they are \"soft\" (lacking heavy shielding or the ability to defend themselves from attack); they usually follow known, predictable orbital paths, with little ability to undertake evasive maneuvers (so they are easily trackable \"sitting ducks\").\nId.\n89.

Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks;[95] if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands.[96] Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.[97]\nAs for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging.[98] Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.[99]\n## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY\nSatellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation.[100] Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations.[101] In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite.\nConsidering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly.\n95. Peeters, supra note 2 (arguing that \"cyber-attacks on satellites are often related to accessing the satellite system via ground stations\").\n96.

For example, as addressed above, the predictability of orbits increases the propensity to attacks but; predictability of orbit is not to be considered a problem for cislunar satellites. These satellites have the opposite problem; satellite orbits tend to shift continuously¹¹⁷ unless they are positioned in proximity of Lagrange points L4 and L5.¹¹⁸ As the lunar economy advances, both government and commercial satellite operators must remain vigilant in safeguarding their assets, even if they perceive cyber-risks as unlikely. This perception of unlikelihood could pose a particular challenge for commercial actors.¹¹⁹ Conversely, governments have been concerned about cybersecurity threats since the inception of the space program.¹²⁰ The government should be proactive in safeguarding commercial systems in a space protection plan because threats to commercial actors’ lunar\n¹¹⁵.

Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government.¹²² While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.¹²³\nIn a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon.¹²⁴ Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities.¹²⁵ Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.¹²⁶\n121.

These include inadvertent harm during military operations, attacks stemming from misidentification or misunderstanding of commercial activities, and deliberate targeting through physical or non-physical means during conflict. It remains uncertain when or how these threats might manifest on the Moon or affect lunar satellites.¹²⁷ While it is true, as baseball player Lawrence Peter “Yogi” Berra famously remarked, that “[i]t’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future,”¹²⁸ the global geopolitical landscape currently reflects a gradual trend towards conflict.¹²⁹ While humanity should aspire for the Moon to remain a “sanctuary of peace,” it is hard to have confidence in this aspiration. Even if we remain hopeful, it is essential for the commercial lunar stakeholders to prepare and ensure the protection of their assets. The cybersecurity landscape for lunar satellites remains uncharted and continually evolving. Thus, tailoring protective measures to address the challenges that these satellites will likely encounter is paramount. Among others, the following measures are recommendable: (1) implementation of a robust encryption/secured system for data transmission and strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access;¹³⁰ (2) shielding satellites systems from radiation-induced errors or data corruption by utilizing radiation-hardened components or implementing error-correction codes;¹³¹ (3) development\nieee.org/cybersecurity-in-space (arguing that cyberthreats targeting crewed spacecraft could involve tactics like infiltrating a craft’s internal computer system with malware or ransomware through close approaches).

This paper later discusses the concept of peaceful purposes¹³⁷ and argues that the prohibition of Article IV(2) of the OST does not apply to lunar orbits.¹³⁸ However, even according to the more restricted interpretation that \"peaceful\" means \"non aggressive,\" it is clear that it would be illegal to establish facilities on the Moon dedicated to hacking another state's lunar satellites. Rule 59 of the Tallinn Manual establishes the duty to respect the State of Registry's ability \"to exercise jurisdiction and control over space objects,\" and the duty to perform \"cyber operations involving outer space with due regard for the need to avoid interference\" with the space activities of others.¹³⁹\nThese rules should be strictly enforced. Consider the catastrophic impact of a cyberattack on a lunar satellite on any of the lunar applications mentioned above. For instance, the wellbeing of lunar residents is expected to be monitored and safeguarded with the assistance of lunar or Earth-based medical teams, utilizing telemedicine, including robotic procedures for surgeries. What potential catastrophic effects might result from a cyberattack that compromises these operations? How concerning would a cyberattack on food production or resource management be? Additionally, what risks would a cyberattack on the smart infrastructure controlling and maintaining lunar facilities pose? A cyberattack of this kind could easily qualify as an international wrongful act. More severe cyberattacks, such as the simultaneous targeting of all state lunar facilities, could even qualify as an \"armed attack\" by employing the scale/effect-based approach.¹⁴⁰\n136.

General Discussion Regarding Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nEven if uncertainties exist, numerous states, including the U.S., hold the view that the current international legal framework adequately governs the conduct of states in cyberspace.¹⁴¹ According to international law, a cyberattack could fall along the spectrum of international responsibility, use of force, and possibly armed attack. The boundaries between these scenarios are not always clearly defined.\nInternational responsibility comes into play when there is a violation of an obligation attributable to a state. An international wrongful act—which is a foundational principle in customary international law—causes a novel legal relationship to arise between states when there is a breach of an international obligation by one of them. In fact, the breach triggers a shift from a primary rule—which is a rule dictating state conduct—to a secondary set of rules of responsibility. Article 2 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ARSIWA”)¹⁴² defines an international wrongful act as a conduct—either action or omission—that is contrary to what a State is required to do by international law, including violations of treaties and customary international law, that is attributable to the State. When the breach is attributable to a state, it initiates a new relationship called a “secondary rule,” which evokes legal consequences for the breaching state. Articles 28–36 of ARSIWA outline the legal ramifications of an internationally wrongful act. The legal framework aims to resolve disputes peaceably without escalating to war. It encompasses the obligation of the breaching state to cease the wrongful conduct, prevent its recurrence, rectify the situation, pay damages, or give satisfaction.\nRule 14 of the Tallinn Manual (“Internationally wrongful cyber acts”)¹⁴³ provides that a state bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to a state and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation. The focus is on acts that are less severe than the use of force, but still carry international repercussions, such as the obligation to provide reparation.\n¹⁴¹ Brian J. Egan, *International Law and Stability in Cyberspace*, 35 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 169, (2017).\n¹⁴² GAOR, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf [hereinafter ARSIWA]. While the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts formulated by the International Law Commission (“ILC”), do not possess inherent legal binding force, they do codify principles of customary international law, which are indeed binding. These principles outline guidelines regarding state responsibility.\n¹⁴³ See TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 67, and accompanying text.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n687\nAn internationally wrongful act denotes a transgression that falls short of constituting an armed assault, but imposes accountability upon the state.¹⁴⁴ Accountability exists only if an internationally wrongful act can be legally attributed to a state.¹⁴⁵ This can be shown by establishing that the state performed the cyberattack directly, the cyberattack was performed by non-state actors whose actions are attributable to the state,¹⁴⁶ or that a state offered help to another.¹⁴⁷ Legal attribution in case of non-state actors is difficult for cyberattacks on Earth, while in space it should be easier since Article VI stipulates that states bear “international responsibility for national activities in outer space,” regardless of whether these activities are conducted by governmental or non-governmental bodies. Article VI outlines principles that simplify attribution—a challenging aspect in terrestrial contexts. This is confirmed by Rule 60 of the Tallinn Manual, providing (a) that states have a duty of a state to “authorise and supervise the cyber ‘activities in outer space’ of its non-governmental entities,” and (b) that “[c]yber operations involving space objects are subject to the responsibility and liability regime of space law.” However, due to the broadly stated principles and obligations outlined in the OST and the lack specific state practices regarding claims for violating OST duties, the circumstances allowing for an internationally wrongful act concerning breaches of duties on the Moon remain uncertain.¹⁴⁸\n144. A cyberattack is not a wrongful act in several circumstances, including when it is the result of self-defense, countermeasures, and necessity. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 19 (“Circumstances precluding wrongfulness of cyber operations”).\n145. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 15 (“Attribution of cyber operations by State organs”). “Cyber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” Id.\n146. ARSIWA Articles 4–11 outline when actions by various entities are seen as acts of a state in international law. Articles 4 and 5 encompass actions by state organs or recognized entities, including authorized individuals yielding governmental authority. Articles 6 and 7 clarify that organs provided by one state to another and actions by state entities, even when exceeding authority, are considered state acts. Articles 8 and 9 define state acts as actions under state control or exercised in the absence of official control, both qualifying as state acts. Articles 10 and 11 address actions of insurrectional movements as state acts, attributing related conduct to those states. Lastly, Article 11 specifies that conduct not directly attributed to a state may be recognized as an act of the state if acknowledged and adopted. See also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, Rule 17 (“Attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors”). “Cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control; or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own.” Id.\n147.

Even if these criteria are met, establishing clear attribution for cyber activities, which is often not feasible, remains an unresolved issue. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nThe affected state has the right to take countermeasures, but does not have to respond with a cyberattack.¹⁴⁹ Countermeasures need not be in kind but must not be indiscriminate; their sole purpose should encourage responsible behavior aligned with the affected state's rights.¹⁵⁰ Furthermore, the countermeasures must not violate human rights, or engage in prohibited belligerent actions, breach peremptory norms, or violate diplomatic and consular inviolability.¹⁵¹ The countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury suffered.¹⁵² and cannot breach a legal obligation owed to a third party.¹⁵³\nSome states have taken a clear position on when cyberattacks constitute an international wrongful act. For example, in 2018, the United Kingdom, declared that cyber operations targeting another state's territory, even below the use of force threshold, can breach international law. Consequently, the affected state, with clear attribution, can take non-forceful, necessary, and proportionate countermeasures directed at the offending state to restore compliance.¹⁵⁴ In 2019, Estonia adopted a similar stance, releasing a statement on countermeasures in the event of a cyberattack.¹⁵⁵ The U.S. made a similar pronouncement in 2021.¹⁵⁶ Ireland followed suit in 2023.¹⁵⁷ France took a similar stance, and went so far as to qualify cyberattacks as a possible violation of sovereignty.¹⁵⁸ Some states also provided extensive declarations regarding the legality\n149.

Ireland, for example, declared to generally follow standard practices and to recognize the legality of countermeasures when directed to compel the offending state to comply with its obligations. Ireland also stated that countermeasures do not need to mirror the original action but must be proportionate and non-forceful. Peculiar aspects of the Irish position are the stipulation that countermeasures must be of a temporary nature and the express recognition that third-party collective countermeasures are permitted (particularly in the context of violation of peremptory norms).¹⁵⁹ Therefore, Ireland directly sided with the Tallinn Manual.¹⁶⁰\n## 2. Satellite Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nWhile no recorded case of kinetic attacks on satellites exist,¹⁶¹ satellites have often been exposed to electronic and cyberattacks.¹⁶² It is worth noting that, from an international law perspective, an argument can be made that a satellite is a quasi-extension of a state's territory because of the quasi-jurisdiction principle of Article VIII of the OST.¹⁶³ Whether Article II OST¹⁶⁴ would bar satellites as a quasi-extension of a state's territory falls beyond the scope of this paper.¹⁶⁵ However, it is important to point out that Article II seems to only refer to land,¹⁶⁶ and it likely emerged from a concern about preventing the \"colonization\" of outer space.¹⁶⁷ This allows for the interpretation that the provision might not necessarily forbid considering a satellite as an extension of a state's territory. Even assuming the inability of states to claim satellites as extensions of their territory, this would not preclude the\n¹⁵⁹. See id.

This provides more than classic territorial jurisdiction and likely covers cyberattacks on the Moon.¹⁷⁰\nAlthough the number of reported cases of satellite cyberattacks is limited, satellite cybersecurity is gaining increased attention.¹⁷¹ China,¹⁷² Russia,¹⁷³ and the United States¹⁷⁴ all possess the capability to disrupt each other's satellites, space assets, and remote weapons using methods like spoofing, jamming, and dazzling.¹⁷⁵ Other countries\n168.

Interference claims typically remain undisclosed within intelligence circles and are seldom publicly confirmed. As discussed in Part II of this paper, both governments and private entities have been involved in satellite cyberattacks. Indeed, all the countries mentioned above—and many others—have the potential to engage in cyber-activities related to satellites; China, Russia, and the U.S. often employ misleading and obstructive tactics targeting each other's satellites.¹⁷⁸ In many cases, it is more speculation than certainty.

These tactics are certainly unlawful,¹⁸⁰ and, if attribution is possible,¹⁸¹ the affected state has the right to take countermeasures. Furthermore, if the tactic rises to the level of an “armed attack,” the situation could escalate to an international armed conflict.¹⁸² Spoofing, jamming, or dazzling affect satellites that are primarily used for national security or defense. Conversely, satellites with different applications, such as search and rescue satellites or civilian telecommunications, do not seem to face similar targeting.¹⁸³ Consequently, the satellite’s function, and particularly its contribution to defense or national security, appears to be a key factor in determining its susceptibility to these non-kinetic interferences.¹⁸⁴\nAffected states have never officially attributed the attacks that they suffered to a specific state.¹⁸⁵ In the absence of formally attributed attacks, there is no precedent or established examples to indicate the threshold at which these interferences would prompt a response from the affected state. It would not be correct to read the absence of a reaction as a recognition that these interferences are necessarily lawful. However, we could at least imply that states, at the moment, would seem to tolerate these minimal interferences with their military or quasi-military satellites.¹⁸⁶ If this mindset carries over to lunar activities, there is a possibility that states might also accept these minor disruptions on the Moon. However, the approach might diverge concerning satellites not involved in military or quasi-military functions, potentially resulting in a different response to their attacks. Also, the unique lunar environment is characterized by its harsh conditions, where compromising even a single satellite could lead to catastrophic consequences. Such conditions could make it challenging to quickly\n179. Dana A. Goward, *Now Hear This - ‘Misnavigation’ or Spoofing?*, U.S. NAVAL INST.

IUS AD BELLUM AND IUS IN BELLO AND THEIR APPLICATION TO SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\nAccording to the proverbial expression \"all is fair in love and war,\" in matters of love and times of war, almost any action is considered acceptable. This paper does not intend to delve into the accuracy of the statement concerning matters of love, but certainly the expression is quite wrong for wars, which are far from being unregulated in international law. In fact, armed conflicts are governed by two distinct bodies of law. The first governs the initiation of an armed conflict (ius ad bellum).^[189]^ The second governs the conduct of hostilities (ius in bello).

The existence of an “armed attack” is essential for justifying the use of force in self-defense, making it an integral part of the ius ad bellum. Also, when an “armed conflict” occurs, it activates for the belligerents the application of the ius in bello.¹⁹¹\nArticle 2.4 of the UN Charter¹⁹² provides that “[a]ll Members must abstain from the threat or use of force in their international relations against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This provision establishes the principle of non-aggression, rendering the use of force, threats of force, including acts of aggression and military interventions, illegal against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence. Notably, it also prohibits any use or threat of force that contradicts the United Nations’ purposes. Three instances exist where the prohibition of use of force within or against another state is lawful: (1) that state’s consent; (2) authorization from the UN Security Council; and (3) individual or collective self-defense.¹⁹³\nThis paper does not discuss the topic of states’ consent¹⁹⁴ or the UN Security Council’s authorization;¹⁹⁵ and it focuses on the right of self-defense, as specifically relevant to a reaction to a cyberattack on a satellite. Self-defense is a principle of customary international law, which is also recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter, which qualifies it as “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.”¹⁹⁶ This right exists whether exercised individually or collectively by states (as under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty).¹⁹⁷ Under the principle of self-defense, a state is allowed to employ force when confronted with an “armed attack.” Nevertheless, the pivotal issue lies in the definition of an “armed attack,” which ultimately determines the applicability of the right to self-defense.¹⁹⁸\nThe UN Charter does not provide a specific definition for the term “armed attack,” and records from the UN Charter’s drafters provide no definitive explanation of the term.¹⁹⁹ Scholars suggest that the inexplicit definition of “armed attack” may exist because the concept was thought to be self-evident. The drafters and negotiators consistently viewed aggression as the catalyst for justifiable self-defense. They\n191. Blank, supra note 189, at 250.\n192. U.N. CHARTER, supra note 12.\n193.

In an initial draft presented by the U.S. to the Five Powers (China, France, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom), it was stated that if the Security Council failed to prevent aggression and it occurred against any member state, that state had an inherent right to take necessary self-defense measures. During that era, two treaties, the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance and Solidarity and the Pact of the League of Arab States, also equated aggression with attack.²⁰⁰\nIn general, scholars consider an “armed attack” as being more severe and significant than a mere use of force indicating that an action could amount to use of force without reaching the level of an “armed attack.” The distinction between forms of force that qualifies as “armed attacks” and actions that imply the use of force, but fall short of being an “armed attack” is unclear, even if some guidance is offered by the international case law.²⁰¹ Particularly important is the Nicaragua case,²⁰² which adopts the “scale and effects” test to judge whether particular hostile actions directed at a state reach the level of an “armed attack.” The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) specified, for instance, that an event as minor as a “border incident” does not qualify as an “armed attack.”²⁰³ Along the same lines, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission²⁰⁴ determined that “geographically limited clashes” in a “remote, unmarked, and disputed border” were not enough to be considered an “armed attack.” Likewise, “localized border encounters” involving “small infantry units,” even resulting “in loss of life” are not an “armed attack.”²⁰⁵ The Nicaragua case clarified that sending regular armed forces across a border or using irregular militias generally constitutes an armed attack. However, providing weapons to rebels across borders does not meet the threshold. The physical impact of an action—including evaluation of the territorial intrusion, casualties, or significant property damage—is a key consideration. Bombardments or kinetic attacks, only qualify as “armed attacks” if\n200.

However, in the Oil Platforms case,²⁰⁶ the court ruled that “the mining of a single military vessel could be sufficient to meet the definition of an ‘armed attack.’”²⁰⁷\nAs discussed, at the United Nation San Francisco Conference of 1945, aggression was considered as the trigger for legitimate self-defense, specifically recognizing “armed attack” as a severe and separate form of aggression.²⁰⁸ For this reason, non-binding UN Resolution 3314 of the 1974 (“Definition of Aggression”)²⁰⁹ remains relevant for defining the term “armed attack.” Article I provides that “[a]ggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition.” Article II provides that “the First use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression” (unless the UN Security Council determines otherwise) while Article III goes on to list some examples of acts of aggression—like invasion, bombardment, blockade of ports, sending troops or mercenaries in another state, et cetera.²¹⁰\nThis paper will not delve any further on the general concept of “armed attack,”²¹¹ the previous discussion should adequately convey the complexity of this concept, which becomes even more challenging when applied to cyberattacks. Furthermore, imminence and immediacy are crucial; the right to use self-defense arises when an “armed attack” is ongoing or impending. The latter is commonly referred to as anticipatory self-defense (“Caroline Test”).²¹² Lastly, when evaluating\n206. Oil Platforms (Iran v.

APPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF “ARMED ATTACK” TO CYBERATTACKS\nIn modern conflicts, cyberattacks can disrupt critical information assets, communications, and weapons systems. Cyberattacks can also cause political disruption by targeting finance, energy, transportation, and government services, thus creating social unrest.²¹⁴ In sum, a cyberattack can inflict damage well beyond that of a single bombardment.²¹⁵ Can a cyberattack be classified as \"an armed attack\" under the UN Charter?²¹⁶ Our discussion centers on cyberattacks existing independently of larger warfare contexts, such as the Ukrainian war.²¹⁷ The focus is on singular or multiple cyberattacks that, devoid of any other military actions, could be perceived as acts of aggression against national security.\nThe possibility for a cyberattack to rise to the level of an \"armed attack\" relevant under the UN Charter is the object of some debate. This paper takes the position that a satellite cyberattack can constitute—in\nthe sinking of an American steamboat (Caroline) used by Canadian insurgents, on orders of the British, caused a famous exchange of letters between United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British representative Lord Ashburton. *Id.* That correspondence is referred to as establishing the elements of the customary international right of self-defense. Webster wrote to Ashburton: \"Under these circumstances, and under those immediately connected with the transaction itself, it will be for her majesty's government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of national law, the destruction of the 'Caroline' is to be defended. It will be for that government to show a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" *Id.*\n²¹³. This paper does not discuss another self-defense restriction: a state invoking self-defense, must quickly inform the UN Security Council. The Council, under Chapter VII, is chiefly responsible for authorizing force in situations jeopardizing global peace, making decisions to maintain or restore it, potentially endorsing force if needed.\n²¹⁴.

Cyber warfare involves cyberattacks targeting nations, causing potential harm to critical infrastructure and even loss of life. However, defining what qualifies as cyber warfare remains a subject of debate among cybersecurity experts, with some suggesting it includes attacks that can result in fatalities.

According to several scholars, cyberattacks can rise to the level of “armed attacks” as the UN Charter’s regulation regarding the use of force can be expanded to encompass cyberattacks conducted by one state against another through interpretative means. Several states share this position. For example, the United Kingdom asserted that, under specific circumstances, a cyberattack can be considered the equivalent of an “armed attack” triggering the right of self-defense. Ireland has adopted the “scale and effect” test, stating that use of force “may include instances where a cyber-operation does not cause physical damages such as where there is significant impairment of functionality of critical infrastructure.” “The circumstances under which non-injurious and non-destructive cyber operations might reach the use of force threshold remains a point of uncertainty among States.” However, only in “exceptional circumstances” could a cyber operation “reach this threshold.”²¹⁸ France asserted that the threshold for the use of force in cyberspace is not solely determined by the digital tools employed, but by the impact of the cyber operation itself. If the effects of a cyber operation resemble those of traditional weaponry, it breaches the prohibition on using force between states.²¹⁹ France acknowledges that even without physical consequences, a cyber operation could qualify as a use of force, in case of severe economic cyber impacts.²²⁰ France also declared the need to evaluate several criteria, including the operation’s origin, instigator’s nature, intrusion level, intended effects, and target, determines this assessment.²²¹ Singapore proclaimed that the factors to consider are several, including the context during the cyber operation, its origin, the intended or actual impact, the level of intrusion, and the characteristics of the target.²²² Singapore and Norway also recognized the possibility of severe economic cyber impacts being seen as an “armed attack.”²²³\nBeyond general views expressed on the topic as discussed above, there are no official statements from states regarding specific instances of cyberattacks. Consequently, experts have sought to bridge this gap in state practice by offering their insights on how international law applies in this domain.²²⁴ Particularly authoritative in this debate is\n218.

SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE\nSpace has not seen direct armed conflict yet, but, unfortunately, it may be only a matter of time. As the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report put it:\nWe know from history that every medium—air, land and sea—has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different. Given this virtual certainty, the U.S. must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space. This will require superior space capabilities.²²⁹\nCurrently, “despite international efforts to stem . . . militarization, outer space is now seen by some as a viable theater of future warfare,\nnature of the connection, if any, between the cyber activity and the particular armed conflict in question”).

While it would seem generally accepted that, akin to physical conflicts, nations possess an inherent right to self-defense in the event of cyberattacks, the boundary of this right remains uncertain in international law, especially on whether the use of force is justified in response to a cyberattack.²³²\n1. Rule 51 (Self-defence against armed attack) Application to Cyberattacks\nWhile Article 51 UN Charter broadly encompasses various forms of attacks, including cyberattacks, the Tallinn Manual appropriately clarifies that a state targeted by a cyberattack maintains the right to self-defense. Rule 71 (“Self-defence against armed attack”) provides: “A State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”²³³ Some states have taken a stance on the right of self-defense in the case of cyberattacks. In 2018, the United Kingdom released the following statement: “It is clear that cyber operations that result in, or present an imminent threat of, death and destruction on an equivalent scale to an armed attack will give rise to an inherent right to take action in self-defence, as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.”²³⁴ The United Kingdom firmly believes that cyber operations leading to, or posing an immediate risk of, severe harm or destruction comparable to an “armed attack” warrant the inherent right to respond in self-defense, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.²³⁵ Canada also recognizes “that the inherent right of self-defence if an ‘armed attack’ occurs against a state also applies in cyberspace.”²³⁶\n230.

Id.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n701\nSame is true for Ireland, which rejects the need for physical damage, suggesting that severe disruption to Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”) systems could warrant a response similar to a conventional attack.²³⁷\nEstablishing attribution in case of a cyberattack that raises to the level of an armed attack is just as difficult as it in case of a cyberattack that does not raise to the level of an armed attack, as we discussed above.²³⁸ Technical attribution is difficult because a cyberattack can be launched from anywhere and perpetrators are often able to conceal their identity, and equally difficult is the attribution to a particular country.²³⁹ However, because in an armed conflict “cyberattacks frequently accompany and facilitate conventional attacks, attribution is less problematic when an armed conflict is already undergoing.”²⁴⁰\nThis paper discussed how self-defense requires imminence and immediacy, i.e. application of the Caroline Test.²⁴¹ Self-defense in case of a cyberattack is no exception. Rule 73 (“Imminence and immediacy”) of the Tallinn Manual provides, “[t]he right to use force in self-defense arises if a cyber armed attack occurs or is imminent. It is further subject to a requirement of immediacy.”²⁴² This paper also discussed how proportionality and necessity are also an issue in self-defense.²⁴³ Just as with a physical attack, the response of a targeted state to a cyberattack must align with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, the state is allowed only to take actions necessary to halt the attack or prevent additional ones. Rule 72 (“Necessity and proportionality”) of the Tallinn Manual provides “[a] use of force involving cyber operations undertaken by a State in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate.”²⁴⁴\nAs the scope of a legitimate self-defense in cyberspace is debatable, afflicted countries are generally cautious when responding to cyberattacks due to the potential for escalation. Typically, diplomatic avenues are prioritized over immediate military or cyber counterattacks in retaliation. Lastly, as for physical attacks, collective self-defense (e.g., NATO) is also allowed.²⁴⁵\n237. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67.\n238. See supra Part III(E)(1).\n239. See supra Part III(E)(1).\n240.

Ius in Bello and Its Application to Satellite Cyberattacks\nThe *ius in bello* governs the conduct of the hostilities, and has evolved over centuries. The *jus in bello* includes the laws of armed conflict (“LOAC”), alternatively known as international humanitarian law (“IHL”).²⁴⁶ This paper takes the position that IHL applies to conflicts in outer space,²⁴⁷ considering that the ICJ held that the IHL “applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future.”²⁴⁸ Consistent is the Tallinn Manual, which unambiguously provides that “[c]yber operations executed in the context of an armed conflict are subject to the law of armed conflict.”²⁴⁹ However, contrary opinions exist.²⁵⁰ There is limited discourse on applying IHL to satellites in lunar or other celestial bodies’ orbits, which is not surprising considering the early stage of the lunar economy and the presence of only a few satellites around the Moon. However, once the principle of IHL applying in outer space is accepted, there is no reason to restrict IHL application to Earth’s orbits.\nThis paper only briefly outlines IHL principles and examines their application in space, specifically focusing on satellites. The following discussion will briefly cover: (1) military necessity; (2) distinction; (3) proportionality; (4) precautions; (5) the principle of constant care; and (6) the principle of avoiding widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment. Military necessity mandates that any action in an international armed conflict must be justified as necessary to gain a clear military advantage.²⁵¹ Distinction requires a clear differentiation between civilians and combatants, as well as civilian and military objectives with operations directed solely at military objects.²⁵² Military objectives are those contributing to military action through their nature, location, purpose, or use, and when their (partial or total) destruction, capture, or neutralization provides a clear military advantage.²⁵³ Rule 93 of the Tallinn Manual clarifies that\n246.

Scholars note that sometimes the purpose of a space object is unclear, and a civilian or commercial space object can be easily converted to military use by reprogramming it to handle military data.²⁵⁸ Regarding the \"definitive military advantage\" requirement, the challenge in space arises from the potential for shifting object locations, changing ownership, or altered circumstances that may render the destruction of a space object no longer providing a clear military advantage.²⁵⁹ Complications arise from the dual-use nature of many space objects, serving both military and civilian roles (like the GPS system). Dual-use objects²⁶⁰ are considered military targets under the principle of distinction.²⁶¹ However,\n254. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 93 (\"Distinction\").\n255. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 99 (\"Prohibition of attacking civilian objects\").

Koplow, ASAT-isfection, supra note 88, at 1194 (making the point that dual use, i.e. when an object serves both military and civilian needs, is common for the United States but also for other countries). Among the countries that utilized dual-use satellites is Russia. See generally Zak, supra note 175 (mentioning that the line between civilian and military use of most Russian orbital assets is often unclear). Applications like communications, navigation, remote sensing, and weather forecasting are crucial for both sectors. These assets can be considered dual-use since government-controlled entities use them for various purposes. Id. at 4. The same author, on the other hand, notes that \"Russia operates a fleet of communications satellites dedicated exclusively to the military\" Id. at 23.

This is consistent with the provision of the Tallinn Manual in point of cyber infrastructure. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 101 (\"Objects used for civilian and military purposes\"). \"Cyber infrastructure used for both civilian and military purposes is a military objective.\" Id. Rule 112 (\"Clearly separated and distinct military objectives\") is also significant, providing that \"[a] cyber attack that treats as a single target a number of clearly discrete cyber military objectives in cyber infrastructure primarily used for\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nevaluating whether those objects can be disrupted requires weighing other principles like proportionality, precautions, and ongoing care.²⁶² Proportionality dictates that an attack should not result in excessive collateral damage to civilians or non-military objects, in relation to the expected, specific, and direct military advantage.²⁶³ The assessment necessitates weighing projected civilian losses against military gains, taking into account all available information.²⁶⁴\nRule 113 of the Tallinn Manual dictates the prohibition to perform a “cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²⁶⁵ When a satellite is dual-use, proportionality is a significant concern because an attack on such a system could result in substantial civilian impact, making proportionality a potential barrier to attacking those objects.²⁶⁶ Precautions mandate attackers to exercise caution in their choice of attack methods, and presents a significant obstacle to targeting space objects, particularly due to the potential creation of space debris—a likely outcome if we are talking of kinetic attacks.²⁶⁷ Scholars suggest that a kinetic attack on a ground station might be the preferred method to achieve a clear military advantage while adhering to the principle of precautions. Rule 121 of the Tallinn Manual mandates the implementation of precautions as well.²⁶⁸\nSatellite cyberattacks could be a viable option under the principle of precautions as it can blind satellites without generating debris.²⁶⁹ The principle of constant care (“requiring that constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians, and civilian objects”) requires evaluation of the impact on civilians, even when they are not in close proximity. This affects the proportionality balance.²⁷⁰ Rule 114 of the Tallinn Manual dictates that “during hostilities involving\ncivilian purposes is prohibited if to do so would harm protected persons or objects.” Id. at Rule 112 (“Clearly separated and distinct military objectives”).\n262.

However, some consider its application to space a logical conclusion.²⁷² If this principle applies to space, it discourages kinetic satellite destruction due to the debris. Attackers might prefer terrestrial or non-kinetic methods like cyberattacks. The Tallinn Manual contains specific provisions for the protection of important installations, of “objects indispensable to survival,” and of the natural environment in general.²⁷³\nThis paper does not discuss international human rights law (IHRL), which in certain cases (states’ exercising power or control) could extend beyond a state’s territory, potentially reaching outer space where no sovereignty exists.²⁷⁴ Though not the main focus, IHRL factors like necessity, proportionality, precautions, and investigations are likely to impact decisions on satellite attacks, including cyberattacks.²⁷⁵ Applying IHRL to space raises concerns about potential violations of the right to life if individuals are killed through satellite targeting.²⁷⁶\nIn conclusion, satellite cyberattacks generally adhere to most IHL principles, except potentially the principle of proportionality.²⁷⁷ The significant repercussions of destroying certain satellites, like the GPS system, may pose challenges due to their impact on the broader civilian population, potentially violating the principle of proportionality. When considering cyberattacks on lunar satellites, several critical factors come into play. The vast distance to the Moon necessitates autonomous operations, making immediate human intervention improbable.\n271. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 114 (“Constant Care”).\n272.

The implications of an attack on lunar satellites might not align with IHL principles, particularly concerning proportionality, as the magnitude of possible outcomes would far exceed acceptable limits, potentially causing indiscriminate harm. This raises concerns about the compatibility of such actions with the established framework of IHL. Furthermore, the growing lunar economy and increased human presence on the Moon will magnify the significance of IHRL concerns. As the utilization of lunar resources expands and human activities on the Moon increase, IHRL considerations are likely to emerge as pressing issues that need careful examination.\n## V. THE OUTER SPACE TREATY AND THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES VIS-À-VIS SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n## A. THE OST PROVISIONS RELEVANT FOR SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n### 1. Articles II, III, VIII, and IX of the OST\nThis paper examines now the regulations governing outer space, primarily outlined in the OST, which apply during both peacetime and wartime.²⁷⁸ Thus, it is a crucial consideration when addressing cyberthreats to satellites. However, this paper takes the position that the principles of *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* are “the *lex specialis* during armed conflict and prevail over the general law of outer space.”²⁷⁹ Several provisions potentially impact the issue of cyberattacks on lunar satellites. First, Article II of the OST, which likely aimed at preventing the “colonization” of outer space,²⁸⁰ and which specifies, “[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”²⁸¹ The prevailing view asserts that this non-appropriation principle applies to both States and private\n²⁷⁸.

II.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n707\nactors,²⁸² despite some influential scholars historically advocating the opposite stance.²⁸³ While states cannot claim territory on the Moon, this does not rule out that a cyberattack on a lunar satellite could be considered an internationally wrongful act²⁸⁴ or could rise to the level of an “armed attack.”²⁸⁵\nSecond, Article III of the OST, which mandates that states conduct activities in line with international law—including the UN Charter—and aims to uphold international peace, security, cooperation, and understanding.²⁸⁶ As a result of this provision, the use of force and its threat are forbidden under Article 2.4 of the UN Charter, except as permitted by Article 51 (pertaining to self-defense) and decisions of the UN Security Council.²⁸⁷\nThird, Article VIII OST,²⁸⁸ which stipulates that a state retains jurisdiction and control over an object launched into outer space under its registry.²⁸⁹ This registration implies authority over the registered object.²⁹⁰ Consequently, a satellite circling the Moon falls under the jurisdiction of the state that officially registered it. This provision establishes a form of jurisdiction similar to the concept of a “flag” state, resembling territorial control over the registered space object\n282. See, e.g., Ricky J. Lee, Article II of the Outer Space Treaty: Prohibition of State Sovereignty, Private Property Rights, or Both, 11 AUSTL. INT’L L.J. 128, 129 (2004) (highlighting how the prohibition must include private entities: because per Article VI, “any act of national appropriation by private entities would be subject to the direction or influence of the State”).\n283. See, e.g., Stephen Gorove, Interpreting Article II of the Outer Space Treaty, 37 FORDHAM L. REV. 349 (1969).

Thus, generally accepted rules and principles, such as the prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defense, would also be in force in outer space. Id. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n288. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n289.

The only difference is that in Space Law, inclusion in the national registry does not confer nationality de jure to the spacecraft, only jurisdiction and control thereon. However, in practice such inclusion entitles the State of registry to exercise its sovereignty over the registered object. This amounts to a quasi-nationality or nationality de facto of the space object.\nId.\n290. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nakin to an airplane flagged with a particular state.²⁹¹ Notably, Article VIII applies solely to “launched” objects, excluding items constructed in space. Therefore, it will not be applicable to satellites constructed directly in lunar orbits.\nFourth, Article IX:²⁹² this paper will only briefly mention the principle of due regard. “In the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty . . . shall conduct all their activities in outer space . . . with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty.”²⁹³ Due regard, akin to a primary “duty of care,”²⁹⁴ stands as a potential mechanism for international responsibility regarding wrongful acts. For example, if State A (or one of its nationals) conducts a cyberattack on a lunar satellites of State B (or one of its nationals), State A would not show proper consideration for the activity of State B. This would violate the obligation of due regard, activating the secondary rule of responsibility previously addressed.²⁹⁵ The exact scope of due regard remains unclear as this provision has never been used, resulting in a dearth of established State practices. In practice, State parties seem hesitant or unwilling to directly acknowledge the concept of “due regard.”²⁹⁶\n## 2. Article IV(1) of the OST\nThe only substantive provision of the OST dealing with military use is Article IV, which (1) prohibits placing in orbit/installing/stationing (as opposed to transiting) nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction in space; (2) requires using the Moon and other celestial bodies (but not empty space) “exclusively for peaceful purposes”;²⁹⁷ and\n291. Id.\n292. OST, supra note 17, at Art. IX. Among other deliberate omissions, this paper does not discuss the harmful interference principal also established by Article IX OST. The harmful interference principle provides that States can engage in international consultations if their space-related activities foreseeably interfere with other nations’ endeavors. Similarly, a State can request consultations if it believes another country’s space actions might disrupt peaceful space exploration. While this clause has potential relevance for lunar satellites, this paper does not discuss it because, for the way in which Article IX is framed, the provision would seem to refer to involuntary interference and not a cyberattack.\n293. Id.\n294. Michael J.

See supra Part III(A).\n296. Listner, The Paradox of Article IX, supra note 294, at 28 (discussing States’ reluctance to resort to Article IX OST).\n297. Member states have interpreted “peaceful” as “non-aggressive” not as “nonmilitary.” See, e.g., Fabio Tronchetti, *Legal aspects of the military uses of outer space*, in *HANDBOOK OF SPACE LAW* (Frans von der Dunk, ed., Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015), at 331–81.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n709\n(3) prohibits using celestial bodies for military bases, for weapon testing, and for military maneuvers.\nWhile more specific than other provisions of the OST, Article IV uses general language and lacks crucial definitions, especially as it pertains to terms such as \"weapons of mass destructions,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"military.\"298 Article IV(1) establishes a ban on certain types of weapons in space (\"nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\"), which cannot be placed \"in orbit around the earth,\" installed \"on celestial bodies,\" \"or stationed in outer space in any other manner.\"299 It does not impose restrictions on non-weapons of mass destruction.300\nArticle IV(1) of the OST has no bearing on the capacity to protect lunar satellites against cyberattacks. In fact, neither nuclear weapons nor weapons of mass destruction are requisite for deterring cyberattacks on lunar satellites. Not only are these weapons unnecessary, but they would also run counter to the principle of proportionality, which governs both the employment of countermeasures for international wrongful acts and the lawful response to \"armed attacks\" in self-defense.\n## 3. Article IV(2) of the OST\nArticle IV(2) of the OST provides that \"the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes\" and bans \"[t]he establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies.\" It provides two exceptions to this overarching prohibition: (1) \"[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,\" and (2) \"[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.\"\nArticle IV(2) of the OST could potentially impact the capacity for deterrence and defense against cyberattacks if it were deemed applicable to orbital regions—a stance this paper does not support—as elucidated below. Before delving into the rationale for this position, let us assess the implications of Article IV(2) of the OST within the specific\n298. COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 71 (arguing that the article lacks definitions that could clarify terms such as \"military uses of space weapon\" and \"peaceful uses,\" preventing a clear differentiation between \"peaceful\" and \"exclusively peaceful\").\n299.

In providing that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used . . . exclusively for peaceful purposes,” the provision would seem to exclude the possibility to militarily defend the assets. Even assuming that this provision does indeed pertain to orbital regions, this provision should not be construed as limiting the right of self-defense. First, the right of self-defense is a well-established norm of customary international law, solidified in Article 51 UN Charter. Its significance and authority are unlikely to be susceptible to influence by a provision framed in such broadly general terms as Article IV(2). Therefore, the right of self-defense must exist in outer space (contrary views exist).³⁰¹ Second, in case of an armed conflict, ius ad bellum and ius in bello are lex specialix that prevail the OST. Article 103 of the UN Charter provides that in cases where members of the United Nations have conflicting obligations under the current Charter and other international agreements, the obligations under the UN Charter shall prevail.³⁰² Third, the term “peaceful” under Article IV(2) should be interpreted as “non-aggressive” and not “as non-military.”³⁰³ The term “peaceful” also appears in the Preamble, Article IX, and Article XI. However, it is only in Article IV(2) that the term “peaceful” is paired with “exclusively,” creating a distinct regulatory emphasis on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Some scholars have pointed out that this is significant to give a special regime to the Moon and other celestial bodies, no matter how the term “peaceful” is interpreted within the OST, the crucial point lies in how Article IV(2) combines it with the term “exclusively.”³⁰⁴\n301. This contrary view states that self-defense on celestial bodies is limited by Article IV OST. See, e.g., Arjen Vermeer, The Laws of War in Outer Space: Some Legal Implications for the Jus ad Bellum and the Jus in Bello of the Militarisation and Weaponisation of Outer Space, in THE NEW ORDER OF WAR (2010) at 6 (arguing that “Article IV OST precludes offensive and defensive military activity on celestial bodies”). See also Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 354 (citing authorities that question the applicability of the right of self-defense in outer space).\n302. While Article 103 talks of “obligations” and not “rights” under the convention, because Article 51 is complementary to Article 2.4 (ban on use of force and threat thereof), Article 103 should be read as to make Article 51 prevail over inconsistent provisions, too.

Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 340 (arguing that the combination of these terms holds significance, as the provision specifies that the moon and other celestial bodies should be utilized “exclusively for peaceful purposes only,” not “exclusively peaceful purposes”). This wording clarifies that any activity remains lawful as long as it maintains peaceful intent; however, once non-peaceful aspects are introduced, its legality is forfeited. In essence, the moon and other celestial bodies are intended to remain devoid of any military utilization. Id. See also, Marko G. Markoff, Disarmament and Peaceful\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n711\nThis paper takes a different perspective. Although interpreting Article IV(2) in accordance with established interpretation principles necessitates considering the adverb \"exclusively,\"[305] the presence of the adverb \"exclusively\" does not alter the fact that the UN Charter (and the inherent right of self-defense) takes precedence over the OST. In addition, \"peaceful\" should be interpreted as \"non-agressive\" and state practice reflects this interpretation.[306] Since the 1950s, space has been utilized for military purposes, carrying a national security implication. Space was initially employed for reconnaissance and then predominantly in a passive capacity during the Cold War. During the Cold War, space was also used for nuclear capability assessments and as national technical means for verification of the non-proliferation treaties.[307] In sum, the military usage of space gradually broadened.[308] Overall, the utilization of space for military purposes expanded over time. It was with the Gulf War in the 1990s, often termed the inaugural \"space war,\" that space assets were actively employed for military operations within a theater of war.[309]\nAlso, the second part of Article IV(2) poses no hindrance to the deterrence and defense of lunar satellites. It explicitly prohibits the utilization of celestial bodies for military bases, weapon testing, and military maneuvers. Arguably, deterrence and protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks are unlikely to necessitate the establishment\nPurposes Provisions in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, Spring 1976, Number 1, at 3, 16 (internal quotation omitted) (arguing that \"this use . . . excludes all kinds of military, and not only warlike activities on planets other than the Earth\"); Bin Cheng, Properly Speaking, Only Celestial Bodies Have Been Reserved for Use Exclusively for Peaceful (Non-Military) Purposes, but Not Outer Void Space, 75 INT'L. L. STU. 81 (2000).\n305. The advocates for the theory that the presence of the adverb \"exclusively\" would mean complete demilitarization of the Moon, also point out to the Antarctica treaty that contains that same language and is \"commonly understood as meaning a complete demilitarization of Antarctica.\" See, e.g., COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287 at 82.\n306.

Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War is commonly cited as the inaugural \"space war\" because of the extensive utilization of space-based capabilities throughout the conflict. The effective deployment of space technologies by the United States military, notably the Global Positioning System (\"GPS\"), played a pivotal role in earning this distinction.

However, if that were the case, the two explicitly stated exceptions to this provision would come into play. As mentioned, these exceptions are as follows: (1) “[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,” and (2) “[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.” Either of these exceptions provides ample flexibility to permit deterrence and protection of lunar satellites. In fact, the satellites slated for deployment around the Moon, at least initially, will serve “scientific research or other peaceful purposes,” such as experiments and enabling lunar mining. An argument can be constructed, therefore, that the deployment of “military personnel” essential for deterring and defending these satellites should fall under this exception. Additionally, under the second exception, the use of any equipment or facility necessary for deterring attacks on and safeguarding these satellites should also be permissible, even if generally prohibited by the overarching provision of the latter part of Article IV(2) because at least initially the lunar satellites will be “necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon.”\nFurthermore, this paper argues that Article IV(2) exclusively applies to the Moon and celestial bodies themselves and does not encompass lunar orbits (as well as the orbits of other planets).[310] Lunar orbits and similar regions can be arguably considered part of empty outer space, exclusively covered by Article IV(1). Consequently, if the need for military defense against cyberattacks on lunar satellites were to arise, it would be legal to station military personnel and equipment in the vicinity of the Moon or lunar orbit (as opposed to the lunar surface). There are several reasons why Article IV(2) does not extend to these orbits. First, the general principle is that Article I of the OST's freedom of use applies to \"empty outer space,\"[311] while the regulation of celestial bodies is the exception. Given that Article IV(2) contains an exception to a general principle, it should be narrowly construed. Second, at least some orbits (i.e., Earth's orbit) have been used \"militarily\" since the inception of the space age, and no state has significantly objected to that use.[312] Therefore, state practice supports the argument that orbits are empty outer space and are not covered by Article IV(2). According to Article 31.3(b) of the Vienna Convention on\n310. See, e.g., COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 81–82 (making the argument that outer space is not covered by Article IV(2)).\n311.

Given that an expansive interpretation of Article IV(2) would pose a substantial obstacle to the exercise of the right of self-defense (in essence, potentially hindering any military protection of lunar installations), it is advisable not to construe Article IV(2) broadly to encompass lunar orbits. Fourth, the Moon Agreement, which holds limited direct significance today, can serve as a valuable tool when used ex contrario to offer insights for interpreting the OST.314 This approach suggests that if the Moon Agreement addresses a particular issue, it may indicate that the OST does not encompass that specific aspect. This is notably applicable to Article 1(2) of the Moon Agreement, which explicitly includes \"orbits around or other trajectories to or around it\" in the Moon's definition, and Article 3 of the Moon Agreement, which provides a more detailed framework for regulating military activities on the Moon.315 Extending the Moon's governance structure to lunar orbit based on the\n313. See United Nations, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 23 May 1969, 1155 TREATY SERIES 331, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf.\n314. Different opinions exist. See, e.g., Michael Listner, The Moon Treaty: failed international law or waiting in the shadows?, THE SPACE REV. (Oct. 24, 2011), https://www.thespacereview.com/article/1954/1 [hereinafter Listner, The Moon Treaty] (\"arguing that although only a few nations ratified the Moon Treaty, the participation of countries like Australia, France, and India as signatories create \"a shadow of customary law which could grow\" so that non-parties may be influenced by the Moon Treaty's shadow if they do not challenge its legitimacy\").\n315. Article 3 of the Moon Agreement provides:\n1. The moon shall be used by all States Parties exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n2. Any threat or use of force or any other hostile act or threat of hostile act on the moon is prohibited. It is likewise prohibited to use the moon in order to commit any such act or to engage in any such threat in relation to the earth, the moon, spacecraft, the personnel of spacecraft or man-made space objects.\n3. States Parties shall not place in orbit around or other trajectory to or around the moon objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction or place or use such weapons on or in the moon.\n4. The establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military maneuvers on the moon shall be forbidden. The use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited. The use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration and use of the moon shall also not be prohibited.\n18 I.L.M. 1434, Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, (Dec. 5, 1979).

However, this argument is less compelling compared to the opposing view supported by the reasons mentioned earlier.\n## B. THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE ARRANGEMENTS\n### 1. The Other Space Treaties\nAfter the OST was enacted in 1967, several other significant treaties were signed between 1968 and 1976. These treaties, namely the Rescue Agreement,³¹⁶ Liability Convention,³¹⁷ and Registration Convention,³¹⁸ also pertain to Moon activities and Moon satellites. None of these treaties are highly pertinent to the subject of this paper, except for the Liability Convention, which could be relevant if a cyber-attack results in measurable damage for which the victim-state seeks compensation.\nIn 1979—the Moon Agreement was signed³¹⁹—and it could have had the potential to significantly influence the subject of this paper. However, this treaty ultimately failed due to the limited number of ratifications. Therefore, while differing opinions exist,³²⁰ this paper contends that the dismissal of the Moon Agreement by the vast majority of states³²¹ (including all major space-faring nations except India and Australia) renders it largely irrelevant for our analysis. However, as previously discussed, it can still serve a purpose when employed in a contrasting manner to enhance our understanding of the interpretation of OST. In other words, if the Moon Agreement found it necessary to address a particular issue, it implies that the OST does not cover that aspect.\n### 2. The Artemis Accords\nThe Artemis Accords³²² intend to create a shared framework of principles to guide the responsible execution of missions falling under\n³¹⁶.

The Artemis Accords are firmly rooted in the OST and emerged as a response to the need for a clearer framework for space activities.³²⁴ While they do not specifically address the defense of lunar satellites (or any other lunar assets), they emphasize cooperation, transparency, and sustainability.³²⁵\nTwo provisions are particularly important for the topic of this paper. Section 5 (“Interoperability”) provides that the Signatories acknowledge that the use of compatible and shared exploration infrastructure and standards (including standard for communication systems) advances exploration, scientific research, and commercial utilization. Therefore the Signatories commit to strive to employ existing interoperability standards, or to create new standards when current ones are absent or insufficient. Interoperability enhances cybersecurity³²⁶ and therefore, by providing this commitment, the Artemis Accords significantly increase protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks. Section 11 (“Deconfliction of Space Activities”), and in particular, Sections 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 are relevant. First, in Section 11.1, the Signatories reconfirm their commitment to the OST with alignment on provisions such as due regard and prevention of harmful interference. Second, in Section 11.3 the Signatories reaffirm the commitment to use due regard, as per Article IX of the OST. Section 11.3 also provides that if a Signatory fears or has suffered harmful interference, that Signatory can initiate a consultation with the other Signatory that authorized the activity (or any party to the OST). Lastly, Section 11.4 commits the Signatories to avoid deliberate actions that could lead to harmful interference with each other’s utilization of outer space. The impact of the above principles on cybersecurity for lunar satellites is undeniable.\ncooperation%20on%20Artemis %20is,of%20the%20 Outer%20Space%20Treaty (last visited Oct 28, 2023).\n³²³.

DEFENDING MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITES\n## A. UNITED STATES' SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY AND DEFENSE\nWhile the attitude of the U.S. towards space exploration and use is peaceful,³²⁷ the United States has repeatedly reaffirmed its right to take countermeasures, its right of self-defense, and its intention to use these rights in case its space activities are threatened.³²⁸ For years, the U.S. has recognized the vulnerability of space objects to both physical attacks and cyberattacks. Already in 2001, the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report pointed out that “with the growing commercial and national security use of space, U.S. assets in space and on the ground offer just such targets. The U.S. is an attractive candidate for a ‘Space Pearl Harbor.’”³²⁹ The concept of space as a domain at risk is repeated in many documents of military doctrine:\n[I]n the contested, congested, and competitive space warfighting domain, our potential adversaries continue to develop, test, and proliferate sophisticated weapons. These weapons have the potential to be the most severe risks to orbital flight. To minimize this risk, it is imperative we execute threat-focused space operations that are fully integrated with timely and relevant intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.³³⁰\nPresident Obama’s National Space Policy³³¹ (“2010 NSP”) emphasizes the safeguarding of space assets mentioning the following necessities: (1) to ensure cost-effective resilience of space capabilities based on their planned use, potential consequences of capability loss, threat levels, and the availability of alternative means to fulfill missions; and (2) to develop and employ strategies and capabilities for the safeguard of critical national security space-dependent missions, including rapid asset restoration and leveraging diverse resources for mission execution.³³² The 2010 NSP suggests proliferation of space capabilities as\n³²⁷. 51 U.S.C. § 20102 (“Congressional declaration of policy and purpose”) provides that “Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.” *Id.*\n³²⁸.

If deterrence fails, the right to self-defense is invoked in accordance with international law and treaty obligations.[334] The 2011 NSSS specified that, although the U.S. believes that all space-faring nations should strive to prevent space hostilities, it acknowledges that some actors might still see military advantage in space-based actions.[335] In 2018, the Trump Administration issued the U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy,[336] and instituted the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency.[337] Specifically on cybersecurity for space, the Trump Administration issued Space Policy Directive 5 - Cybersecurity Principles for Space System (\"SPD-5\"), which focused on cybersecurity for space systems and urged federal agencies and non-governmental space operators to establish cybersecurity norms.[338]\nIn 2020, the National Space Policy (\"2020 NSP\")[339] reaffirmed the right of self-defense providing that if any adversary jeopardizes the advantages that the U.S. gains from space, the U.S. will use all means to deter and, if needed, overcome hostile actions in space.

NOAA has introduced a provision in its licensing requirements mandating positive control over these systems, restricting unauthorized access to data transmissions, and governing the collection and distribution of enhanced data in specified areas at the request of the U.S. government. More agencies should follow NOAA’s initiative to create specific standards guiding implementation.\nIn conclusion, all these documents reaffirm the U.S.’ commitment to improve resilience of cyber-systems, to practice effective deterrence against cyberattacks, and to use available countermeasures and the right of self-defense in case of attacks. However, with the growth of the lunar economy, a more concentrated emphasis on the Moon is advised.\n## B. NATO’s POSITION\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), established in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty,³⁶⁵ is a political and military alliance created as a collective defense organization among North American and European countries, totaling thirty-two members.³⁶⁶ Collective defense is NATO’s bedrock: NATO members pledge to consider an attack against any of its members as an attack against all, triggering a duty to respond collectively.³⁶⁷ Equally significant is the aspect of defense planning, meaning that the members collaborate on planning their defense and developing military capabilities against security challenges. Also crucial is the aspect of cooperative security, which means that NATO cooperates with non-member countries and international organizations to promote security and stability, such as conventional military threats, terrorism, and hybrid warfare, and cyberattacks.\nTo comprehend NATO’s stance on cyberattacks targeting satellites, it is essential to recognize that the matter resides at the intersection of NATO’s position on satellite defense and its response to cyberattacks. NATO has been increasingly focused on protecting and defending its members’ satellites, considering that satellites are crucial to communication, navigation, reconnaissance, and military operations. In 2019, NATO officially recognized space as an operational domain “alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace.”³⁶⁸\n---\n³⁶⁴.

Both satellites and ground-based facilities are potential targets for these threats.371 NATO's goal is not to become an independent space player,372 but to enhance and contribute to the efforts of its member states and collaborate with other pertinent international organizations.373 This includes enhancing space domain awareness374 in cooperation with space agencies and advancing counter-space capabilities and technologies for safeguarding space assets, including cybersecurity defense.\nNATO has reaffirmed its long-standing belief that cyberspace is continuously contested by various state and non-state actors.375 Most notably, NATO's robust engagement in cyber defense and the role of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (\"CCDCOE\") are evidenced by the Tallinn Manual.376 An important example of NATO's approach regarding a specific cyberattack exists. In 2007, Estonia endured a massive cyberattack from Russia, which was likely provoked by the controversial relocation of a Red Army statue to a cemetery.

Estonia invoked Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, alleging an attack by Russia. However, NATO determined that the events did not meet the threshold of an “armed attack,” reflecting an effects-based approach to assessing cyberattacks. Referring to UN Charter Article 51, NATO concluded that Russia’s actions did not qualify as an “armed attack,” and therefore, the right to self-defense for NATO member states did not come into effect.³⁷⁷\nIt is challenging to predict what NATO would do in case of a cyberattack on the Moon because it is a vastly different environment compared to Earth, and the impact of a cyberattack on a satellite or group of satellites may vary significantly. Also, on the Moon a cyberattack could be more impactful (due to the scarcity of satellites) or less impactful (due to the limited number of people affected). However, one could make a reasonable argument that if NATO did not view the extensive 2007 cyberattack in Estonia as meeting the criteria for a cyberattack requiring collective self-defense, it would be even more unlikely for NATO to categorize an attack on a lunar satellite in that way.\n## C. OTHER SPACEFARING COUNTRIES VIS-À-VIS LUNAR SATELLITES\n### 1. China\nChina’s progress in space technologies, initially non-military in nature, carries significant military implications because of their dual-use potential.³⁷⁸ This duality is evident in Chinese space missions like lunar exploration, where technologies developed for these purposes—such as robotics, radar networks, and materials—have the potential for military adaptation. While China may not explicitly articulate military intentions for space in their policies or directives, and consistently advocates for the use of outer space only for “peaceful purposes.”³⁷⁹\n³⁷⁷.

This reorganization also involved dismantling the Strategic Support Force (“SSF”) and creating the Aerospace Force (“AF”) and Cyberspace Force (“CF”).³⁸³\nEvidence suggests that China regularly utilizes jamming and spoofing methods on GPS satellites to safeguard sensitive areas from drone surveillance or potential attacks. Additionally, there are reports of China targeting U.S. government satellites on a daily basis.³⁸⁴ If China gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable China might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well. China has also developed ground-based laser systems designed to dazzle the optical sensors of spy satellites as they pass over sensitive sites to temporarily prevent the satellite from taking a picture or physically damage the image sensor.³⁸⁵\n380.

Consider a scenario where reconnaissance satellites encircling the Moon traverse over Chinese installations, only to be dazzled.\n2. Russia\nNotwithstanding numerous declarations to the effect that space must be reserved for peaceful purposes,³⁸⁸ evidence exists that Russia continues in the militarization of space. Russian space law—largely governed by Federal Law No. 5663³⁸⁹—stipulates that space activities must adhere to legal provisions for safeguarding state secrets, military and commercial secrets, intellectual property, and exclusive rights. This suggests that the federal law acknowledges Russia's intention to utilize space for military purposes.³⁹⁰ Despite some progress in national security space capabilities, the Russian space industry is currently grappling with an era of stagnation.³⁹¹\nLately, Russia has heightened its efforts in developing antisatellite systems, with some of these efforts being publicly disclosed. Additionally, Russia has been engaged in the creation of orbital maneuvering satellites, potentially for tasks related to inspection and interception. The advancement in these technologies not only hints at Russia's intention to target reconnaissance and communication satellites, but also signifies a growing unease within Russia regarding the perceived weaponization of space by others.³⁹² Given Russia's long history of imperialism, reasonable doubts exist that its advocacy for peace in space might stem more from its current limited space capabilities, rather than from a genuine desire for space to remain a sanctuary.

CONCLUSION\nThis paper has delved into the issue of cyber-threats for satellites in non-Earth orbits, particularly in lunar orbits, amid escalating cyber-risks. The growing cislunar and lunar economy will heighten vulnerability, especially for commercial lunar satellites lacking robust protection. Just as Earth-orbiting satellites have faced increasing threats, lunar satellites will be confronted with similar risks in the expanding lunar economy. With a limited number of satellites orbiting the Moon, this paper has drawn insights from threats facing Earth's satellites to anticipate risks for lunar counterparts, focusing specifically on cyberthreats. Cyberthreats pose unique challenges due to attribution complexities and scope of the right of self-defense. This paper has examined cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and as armed attacks, assessing affected states' rights to self-defense. Considering provisions in the UN Charter and the OST, this paper has concluded that Article IV of the OST cannot be interpreted as impeding the right of self-defense of lunar satellites. Even if certain restrictions exist, this paper has argued that the right of self-defense would prevail when constrained by these limitations. Preserving security for both government and commercial satellites remains crucial for U.S. national interests, and it will become paramount on the Moon as well. The recognition that the right of self-defense is not diminished in space is an important component of satellite security.\n³⁹³. Dong L.

Highlighting the intricate nature of cyber threats and their impact on both governmental and commercial satellites, this paper examines cyberattacks as potential international wrongful acts and armed attacks. This paper evaluates the right of affected states to self-defense and scrutinizes Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty (\"OST\"), alongside other pertinent treaties' provisions. This paper concludes that Article IV of the OST should not be interpreted as to impede the right of self-defense for lunar satellites, and claims that the inherent right of self-defense overrides the OST's restrictions, allowing for protection for lunar satellite assets.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nThis paper discusses the legal issues of protecting satellites in lunar (and other non-earth) orbits from cyberattacks. Lunar satellites are included in the \"cislunar\" space but present special characteristics that differentiate them from the satellites around Earth. This paper focuses on lunar satellites due to the expanding cislunar and lunar economy. This expansion is expected to result in an escalation of cyberrisks for lunar satellites—particularly for commercial ones, which have less robust protection compared to their military counterparts. Similar to Earth-orbiting satellites—upon which our economy has come to rely—which are facing growing threats from competitors and adversaries openly expressing their intention to disrupt these satellites in times of conflict, lunar satellites are likely to face the same threats, with the expansion of the lunar economy.\nDue to the limited number of satellites currently orbiting the Moon, this paper analyses the threats faced by Earth's satellites and derives insights applicable to lunar satellites. Potential adversaries are constantly trying to capitalize on perceived weaknesses in space capabilities, and satellites are exposed to several threats (including physical/kinetic, non-kinetic/physical, electronic, and cyber); however, this paper focuses on\n1. 42 U.S.C. § 18302 (defining \"Cis-lunar space\" as \"the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon\").\n2.

Cyberthreats are different from the other threats because establishing attribution in cyberattack cases is especially difficult, and assessing damages—particularly under the Liability Convention—would be complex, thus making it even more challenging to seek satisfaction. Preserving the security of both governmental and commercial satellites is essential for the United States national interests.\nThis paper will discuss in Part III(E) and Part IV, respectively, cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and cyberattacks as “armed attacks.” In both cases, the affected state has a right to react, albeit with differing degrees of severity. Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”) prohibits use of force or threat thereof. Self-defense (including collective self-defense as in the North Atlantic Treaty) stands as an exception as per Article 51 of the UN Charter, incorporating a fundamental principle within customary international law. This paper examines if a cyberattack qualifies as use of force, granting affected states the right to countermeasures, and, if the cyberattack escalates to an armed attack, whether self-defense permits the use of force or threat thereof.\nThe Preamble of the Outer Space Treaty (“OST”) frames exploration and use of space as an aspirational principle. However, “peaceful purposes” is not defined by the OST. Article IV of the OST—which is a rare instance in which the Moon and other celestial bodies are treated separately and distinct from the empty outer space—is the\n7. Erwin, supra note 4.\n8. The level of attribution varies, with the kinetic/physical attacks being the easiest to attribute, followed by the non-kinetic physical ones, with the electronic and cyber having the most difficult attribution. The issue of attribution is very challenging in cybersecurity. First, technical attribution is difficult. Second, even if technical attribution is possible, the problem of legal attribution remains.\n9. U.N.G.A.

China's competing lunar program, the 2007 Chang'e Program, has already achieved notable accomplishments: Chang'e-1 and 2 mapped the lunar surface; Chang'e-4 landed on the Far Side of the Moon; Chang'e-5 collected lunar samples and returned them to Earth; and Chang'e-6, which was recently launched, focuses on collecting samples from the Moon's Far Side. China has plans for even more ambitious missions, primarily for scientific, economic, and status-enhancing purposes, including landing taikonauts on the Moon and establishing an orbiting lunar station by 2030, which also has international components.\n31.

THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF LUNAR SATELLITES\nIn the lunar economy, both governmental entities and private enterprises will need dependable navigation and communication capabilities. Under the Artemis program, a unified communication system will support all missions; The European Space Agency (“ESA”) will supply a complete network of satellites, which will operate through the Moonlight initiative consortium. Lockheed Martin’s subsidiary, Crescent Space Services LLC, will provide Parsec, a lunar orbit satellite network catering to communication services for lunar spacecraft and surface operations.

First, for lunar communication: in order to maintain contact with assets on the lunar surface, lunar satellites will serve as communication relay stations, enabling data transfer, audio/video communication, and command and control of lunar rovers/other equipment.58 Upcoming lunar missions anticipate reliance on emerging cislunar space networks, comprising a special network for communication including relay satellites, orbiters, and spacecraft.59 With the establishment of a stable presence on the Moon, the communication need will be even more pressing. Before its Chang'e-4 mission, China positioned Queqiao, a relay satellite, into a halo orbit beyond the Moon. Its primary objective was to facilitate communication between Earth-based ground stations and the Far Side, where the Chang'e-4 lander would operate.60 To support its Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8, China launched another relay satellite, named Queqiao-2.61\nSecond, for navigation and positioning: lunar activities (including landing, navigation, mapping, and mining) will likely use satellite systems like Global Navigation Satellite System (\"GNSS\") or lunar-specific positioning systems to provide accurate location information\n56.

Fourth, for lunar exploration and scientific experiments: lunar satellites (e.g., remote sensing satellites) will play a crucial role in analyzing the lunar surface and mapping it, and in conducting scientific experiments from lunar orbit. For example, China has been experimenting with a quantum cis lunar satellite. Fifth, for espionage: because several stakeholders will operate on the Moon (and will often be adversary) lunar satellites will also play a reconnaissance role.

CYBER-RISKS FOR SATELLITES\n### A. SELECTED EXAMPLES OF SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\nSatellite hacking has occurred on multiple occasions. In 2011, the U.S. issued a report, revealing that cyber-intruders (possibly connected to Chinese military groups) had disrupted the operations of two U.S. government satellites on four separate occasions in the previous years. Troubling incidents of cyberattacks have happened in connection with the Ukrainian War. Immediately prior the invasion, Russia initiated a massive cyberattack against ViaSat, a satellite company, disabling and infecting all the ground modems responsible for transmitting signals to/from the satellites, rendering the systems inoperable. The attack impacted not only Ukraine (which used ViaSat for military communication) but also other Central and Eastern European nations,\n68. Katherine Fang et al., A Right to Spy?

Amtel-Svyaz, the parent company of Dozor, acted swiftly, taking control of one network while three remained down. Dozor-Teleport did not disclose specific attack details, and it is unclear whether the terrestrial network was affected or the satellites themselves. A self-proclaimed “hacktivist” organization and a branch of the Wagner Group both claimed responsibility, asserting that they sent malicious software to the satellite terminals.74 In 2022, Elon Musk revealed that SpaceX’s Starlink satellites had been subjected to numerous cyberattacks in the wake of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.75\n## B. WHY SATELLITES ARE PARTICULARLY EASY TARGETS FOR CYBERATTACKS\nA satellite could be attacked kinetically or non-kinetically. “Kinetic” means actions involving physical force or direct contact, such as bombings and other types of attacks that cause physical damage, while “non-kinetic” attacks are those that do not involve a direct physical force. A cyberattack—the focus of this paper—is a form of non-kinetic attack being carried out by digital means to compromise, disrupt, or damage data, infrastructure, or communication. The term “cyberattack” has several definitions, including the following: “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident or transiting these systems or networks.” Cyberattacks are performed through malware, hacking, denial-of-service, and other tactics aimed at compromising or disrupting computer systems, networks, and data. A cyberattack can aim at stealing sensitive information, or causing system malfunctions, or blocking the system (unblocking it only after the payment of a sum of money called ransomware).\nCyberattacks are not the only possible form of non-kinetic attacks. Spoofing (use of deceptive or fraudulent electronic data or communications to deceive, manipulate a system, or disguise the attacker’s\n73.

Scholars Georgeson and Stubbs explain that satellites are vulnerable due to several factors: (1) they are typically unshielded; (2) they follow predictable orbits, (3) they have limited maneuverability, (4) they are \"few enough in number\" that their destruction could have substantial repercussions; (5) replacing them is costly and consuming; and (6) numerous satellites have dual-use functionality, providing services to the military and to civilians, making them potential targets for enemy attacks.80\nNot all of the factors mentioned above are equally relevant to protection against cyberattacks. As for shielding:81 while shielding against destructive attacks like kinetic anti-satellite missiles is difficult, protection against non-kinetic attacks is feasible (e.g., to safeguard against electronic attacks, a shutter shield could protect specific sensors or satellite lids; shielding could be effective against blinding lasers or dazzlers). Shielding satellites against kinetic attacks is not only challenging but also costly, as it increases expenses not only during\n76. While different from a cyberattack, spoofing can be used in a cyberattack to trick the system into believing that the source of a cyberattack is a legitimate source. For example, in a phishing attack, attackers may use email spoofing to make an email appear as though it comes from a trusted source.

Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\ndevelopment but also during launch due to the added weight.82 Dissimilarly, protection against cyberattacks does not necessitate an increase in weight, and therefore launch costs. While development expenses are still a consideration, it is crucial for all satellite operators to create a robust cybersecurity system.\nAs for predictability of orbit and fuel scarcity: satellites follow predictable orbits,83 not only due to the laws of physics, but also because they carry limited fuel—which restricts their ability to make significant changes to their orbits. Additionally,84 technical limitations on maneuverability and fuel scarcity result in satellite operators being unable to make rapid maneuvers, even if they detect that an attack is coming.85 Cyberattacks would not be affected by predictability of orbit or limited maneuverability because cyberattacks happen in the \"cyberworld,\" where maneuverability is not necessary; only a robust cybersecurity program is essential.\nIn terms of the limited number (i.e., lack of redundancy of satellites), the landscape is swiftly evolving.86 While satellites remain relatively scarce, LEO constellations are significantly altering this scenario in many instances, making lack of redundancy somewhat less impactful. However, this is not universally applicable to every satellite type or operator. In certain instances, operators might not possess hundreds or thousands of satellites performing the same functions; they might have only a few, which play a pivotal role in providing crucial services.87 All things considered, satellites are still relatively few in number.88\n82.

Stating:\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIn addition to the above factors, there are factors specific to cyberattacks, such as a lack of system redundancies, the remote nature of satellite operations, and limited or outdated computer resources. Some of the satellites lack system redundancy. System redundancy involves incorporating supplementary components, resources, or elements within a satellite that are not strictly essential for its operation but are included to improve reliability, availability, fault tolerance, and overall robustness.[92] Although redundant systems can still be susceptible to cyberattacks,[93] redundancy could mitigate the risk because, if a component is compromised due to a cyberattack, other components might be capable of fulfilling its functions. Today satellites—at least the larger ones—are designed with redundancy in mind.[94]\n[Satellites] are still relatively few in number (so destroying or damaging even a handful could have a major impact); they are \"soft\" (lacking heavy shielding or the ability to defend themselves from attack); they usually follow known, predictable orbital paths, with little ability to undertake evasive maneuvers (so they are easily trackable \"sitting ducks\").\nId.\n89.

Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks;[95] if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands.[96] Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.[97]\nAs for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging.[98] Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.[99]\n## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY\nSatellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation.[100] Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations.[101] In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite.\nConsidering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly.\n95. Peeters, supra note 2 (arguing that \"cyber-attacks on satellites are often related to accessing the satellite system via ground stations\").\n96.

THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF LUNAR SATELLITES\nThis paper has discussed how, as the lunar economy grows, dependable navigation and communication will be crucial for both government and private lunar missions. Currently, lunar orbits remain relatively uncrowded. However, some satellites and orbiters from previous lunar missions are still orbiting the Moon. As of July 2023, there were at least six “active lunar orbiters:” Artemis P1 and Artemis P2 (operating “in eccentric orbits of low inclination”); NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (orbiting “the Moon in a nearly polar, slightly elliptical orbit”); Chandrayaan-2 of the Indian Space Agency and Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (both operating in “in polar orbits of 100 km altitude”); and NASA’s Capstone (having a completely different, and much higher orbit). Additionally, two non-operative spacecrafts (the 2009 Japanese Ouna and the Indian 2008 Chandrayaan-1) currently\n.

Lunar satellites will face geophysical threats coming from the Moon's environment.\nThe main concern is that the Moon is not nearby enough to quickly address these issues. Therefore, planned lunar missions must be sustainable and autonomous. In regards to cybersecurity, when planning lunar missions, scientists and engineers must use various models to approximate real conditions—such as thermal environments, difficulties in communications and navigation systems, placement and maneuvering of the spacecraft, as well as generation and storage of the power. However, uncertainties, unknowns, or unforeseen circumstances on the Moon may pose hazards for lunar missions.\nNo documented cyberthreats have targeted satellites in lunar orbits, but security breaches in space agencies have sparked worries about mission safety. NASA frequently discloses cybersecurity issues, such as unauthorized attempts to access its systems. In 2019, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported a data breach resulting from unauthorized access. Though these incidents might not have caused visible harm, NASA and other government entities and organizations must always focus on safeguarding their digital assets and infrastructure.\nRecognizing the critical role of lunar satellites, the 2022 National Cislunar Science &amp; Technology Strategy (\"NCS&amp;T Strategy\"), in outlining its key objectives, provided for the need to \"implement Cislunar communications and PNT capabilities with scalable and interoperable approaches\" and for the extension of \"space situational awareness capabilities into Cislunar space.\" The NCS&amp;T Strategy contains two specific mentions of cybersecurity, clarifying that cybersecurity is\n.

For example, as addressed above, the predictability of orbits increases the propensity to attacks but; predictability of orbit is not to be considered a problem for cislunar satellites. These satellites have the opposite problem; satellite orbits tend to shift continuously unless they are positioned in proximity of Lagrange points L4 and L5. As the lunar economy advances, both government and commercial satellite operators must remain vigilant in safeguarding their assets, even if they perceive cyber-risks as unlikely. This perception of unlikelihood could pose a particular challenge for commercial actors. Conversely, governments have been concerned about cybersecurity threats since the inception of the space program. The government should be proactive in safeguarding commercial systems in a space protection plan because threats to commercial actors’ lunar\n. Id. at 13.\n. Id.\n. M. J.

Lunar commercial actors may initially show minimal enthusiasm for addressing security concerns, similar to the findings that reflected their lack of interest in discussing security matters for satellites in Earth's orbit, as revealed in a 2018 survey. Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government. While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.\nIn a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon. Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities. Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.\n121. Id. at 18.\n122.

Inspired by the ESA's depiction of lunar economic aspects, diverse potential scenarios emerge. ESA lists several “[a]pplication Areas Supporting a Sustainable Lunar Presence.” For example, the Moon will have solar panel farms for the production of electricity, water extraction facilities, manufacturing facilities utilizing regolith as construction material, transportation services, habitation to house humans, food production installations, waste management facilities, health services, educational facilities, entertainment facilities, smart infrastructures, and other services.\nCyber operations on the Moon and other celestial bodies may be conducted only for peaceful purposes.

Additionally, what risks would a cyberattack on the smart infrastructure controlling and maintaining lunar facilities pose?

General Discussion Regarding Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nEven if uncertainties exist, numerous states, including the U.S., hold the view that the current international legal framework adequately governs the conduct of states in cyberspace. According to international law, a cyberattack could fall along the spectrum of international responsibility, use of force, and possibly armed attack. The boundaries between these scenarios are not always clearly defined.\nInternational responsibility comes into play when there is a violation of an obligation attributable to a state. An international wrongful act—which is a foundational principle in customary international law—causes a novel legal relationship to arise between states when there is a breach of an international obligation by one of them. In fact, the breach triggers a shift from a primary rule—which is a rule dictating state conduct—to a secondary set of rules of responsibility. Article 2 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ARSIWA”) defines an international wrongful act as a conduct—either action or omission—that is contrary to what a State is required to do by international law, including violations of treaties and customary international law, that is attributable to the State. When the breach is attributable to a state, it initiates a new relationship called a “secondary rule,” which evokes legal consequences for the breaching state. Articles 28–36 of ARSIWA outline the legal ramifications of an internationally wrongful act. The legal framework aims to resolve disputes peaceably without escalating to war. It encompasses the obligation of the breaching state to cease the wrongful conduct, prevent its recurrence, rectify the situation, pay damages, or give satisfaction.\nRule 14 of the Tallinn Manual (“Internationally wrongful cyber acts”) provides that a state bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to a state and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation. The focus is on acts that are less severe than the use of force, but still carry international repercussions, such as the obligation to provide reparation.\n Brian J. Egan, *International Law and Stability in Cyberspace*, 35 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 169, (2017).\n GAOR, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf [hereinafter ARSIWA]. While the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts formulated by the International Law Commission (“ILC”), do not possess inherent legal binding force, they do codify principles of customary international law, which are indeed binding. These principles outline guidelines regarding state responsibility.\n See TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 67, and accompanying text.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\n144. A cyberattack is not a wrongful act in several circumstances, including when it is the result of self-defense, countermeasures, and necessity. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 19 (“Circumstances precluding wrongfulness of cyber operations”).\n145. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 15 (“Attribution of cyber operations by State organs”). “Cyber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” Id.\n146. ARSIWA Articles 4–11 outline when actions by various entities are seen as acts of a state in international law. Articles 4 and 5 encompass actions by state organs or recognized entities, including authorized individuals yielding governmental authority. Articles 6 and 7 clarify that organs provided by one state to another and actions by state entities, even when exceeding authority, are considered state acts. Articles 8 and 9 define state acts as actions under state control or exercised in the absence of official control, both qualifying as state acts. Articles 10 and 11 address actions of insurrectional movements as state acts, attributing related conduct to those states. Lastly, Article 11 specifies that conduct not directly attributed to a state may be recognized as an act of the state if acknowledged and adopted. See also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, Rule 17 (“Attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors”). “Cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control; or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own.” Id.\n147. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 18 (“Responsibility in connection with cyber operations by other States”).\n148. BERGAMASCO, ET AL., CYBERSECURITY: KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, supra note 70, at 119–20 (noting how the practical significance of cyber activities by non-governmental entities is limited because a state can only authorize and oversee cyber activities a state is informed about). Even if these criteria are met, establishing clear attribution for cyber activities, which is often not feasible, remains an unresolved issue. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nThe affected state has the right to take countermeasures, but does not have to respond with a cyberattack. Countermeasures need not be in kind but must not be indiscriminate; their sole purpose should encourage responsible behavior aligned with the affected state's rights. Furthermore, the countermeasures must not violate human rights, or engage in prohibited belligerent actions, breach peremptory norms, or violate diplomatic and consular inviolability. The countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury suffered. and cannot breach a legal obligation owed to a third party.\nSome states have taken a clear position on when cyberattacks constitute an international wrongful act. For example, in 2018, the United Kingdom, declared that cyber operations targeting another state's territory, even below the use of force threshold, can breach international law. Consequently, the affected state, with clear attribution, can take non-forceful, necessary, and proportionate countermeasures directed at the offending state to restore compliance.

Satellite Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nWhile no recorded case of kinetic attacks on satellites exist, satellites have often been exposed to electronic and cyberattacks. It is worth noting that, from an international law perspective, an argument can be made that a satellite is a quasi-extension of a state's territory because of the quasi-jurisdiction principle of Article VIII of the OST. Whether Article II OST would bar satellites as a quasi-extension of a state's territory falls beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is important to point out that Article II seems to only refer to land, and it likely emerged from a concern about preventing the \"colonization\" of outer space. This allows for the interpretation that the provision might not necessarily forbid considering a satellite as an extension of a state's territory. Even assuming the inability of states to claim satellites as extensions of their territory, this would not preclude the\n. See id.

In fact, the wrongful conduct does not need to occur in the territory of a state for a wrongful act to be found. The Tallinn Manual provides, for example, that a state can assert territorial jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure, individuals engaged in cyber activities within its borders, cyber activities originating from or concluding within its territory, and cyber activities that have a substantial effect within its borders. This provides more than classic territorial jurisdiction and likely covers cyberattacks on the Moon.\nAlthough the number of reported cases of satellite cyberattacks is limited, satellite cybersecurity is gaining increased attention.

These tactics are certainly unlawful, and, if attribution is possible, the affected state has the right to take countermeasures. Furthermore, if the tactic rises to the level of an “armed attack,” the situation could escalate to an international armed conflict. Spoofing, jamming, or dazzling affect satellites that are primarily used for national security or defense. Conversely, satellites with different applications, such as search and rescue satellites or civilian telecommunications, do not seem to face similar targeting. Consequently, the satellite’s function, and particularly its contribution to defense or national security, appears to be a key factor in determining its susceptibility to these non-kinetic interferences.\nAffected states have never officially attributed the attacks that they suffered to a specific state. In the absence of formally attributed attacks, there is no precedent or established examples to indicate the threshold at which these interferences would prompt a response from the affected state. It would not be correct to read the absence of a reaction as a recognition that these interferences are necessarily lawful. However, we could at least imply that states, at the moment, would seem to tolerate these minimal interferences with their military or quasi-military satellites. If this mindset carries over to lunar activities, there is a possibility that states might also accept these minor disruptions on the Moon. However, the approach might diverge concerning satellites not involved in military or quasi-military functions, potentially resulting in a different response to their attacks. Also, the unique lunar environment is characterized by its harsh conditions, where compromising even a single satellite could lead to catastrophic consequences. Such conditions could make it challenging to quickly\n179. Dana A. Goward, *Now Hear This - ‘Misnavigation’ or Spoofing?*, U.S. NAVAL INST.

The existence of an “armed attack” is essential for justifying the use of force in self-defense, making it an integral part of the ius ad bellum. Also, when an “armed conflict” occurs, it activates for the belligerents the application of the ius in bello.\nArticle 2.4 of the UN Charter provides that “[a]ll Members must abstain from the threat or use of force in their international relations against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This provision establishes the principle of non-aggression, rendering the use of force, threats of force, including acts of aggression and military interventions, illegal against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence. Notably, it also prohibits any use or threat of force that contradicts the United Nations’ purposes. Three instances exist where the prohibition of use of force within or against another state is lawful: (1) that state’s consent; (2) authorization from the UN Security Council; and (3) individual or collective self-defense.\nThis paper does not discuss the topic of states’ consent or the UN Security Council’s authorization; and it focuses on the right of self-defense, as specifically relevant to a reaction to a cyberattack on a satellite. Self-defense is a principle of customary international law, which is also recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter, which qualifies it as “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.” This right exists whether exercised individually or collectively by states (as under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty). Under the principle of self-defense, a state is allowed to employ force when confronted with an “armed attack.” Nevertheless, the pivotal issue lies in the definition of an “armed attack,” which ultimately determines the applicability of the right to self-defense.\nThe UN Charter does not provide a specific definition for the term “armed attack,” and records from the UN Charter’s drafters provide no definitive explanation of the term. Scholars suggest that the inexplicit definition of “armed attack” may exist because the concept was thought to be self-evident. The drafters and negotiators consistently viewed aggression as the catalyst for justifiable self-defense. They\n191. Blank, supra note 189, at 250.\n192. U.N. CHARTER, supra note 12.\n193.

Particularly important is the Nicaragua case, which adopts the “scale and effects” test to judge whether particular hostile actions directed at a state reach the level of an “armed attack.” The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) specified, for instance, that an event as minor as a “border incident” does not qualify as an “armed attack.” Along the same lines, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that “geographically limited clashes” in a “remote, unmarked, and disputed border” were not enough to be considered an “armed attack.” Likewise, “localized border encounters” involving “small infantry units,” even resulting “in loss of life” are not an “armed attack.” The Nicaragua case clarified that sending regular armed forces across a border or using irregular militias generally constitutes an armed attack. However, providing weapons to rebels across borders does not meet the threshold. The physical impact of an action—including evaluation of the territorial intrusion, casualties, or significant property damage—is a key consideration. Bombardments or kinetic attacks, only qualify as “armed attacks” if\n200.

However, in the Oil Platforms case, the court ruled that “the mining of a single military vessel could be sufficient to meet the definition of an ‘armed attack.’”\nAs discussed, at the United Nation San Francisco Conference of 1945, aggression was considered as the trigger for legitimate self-defense, specifically recognizing “armed attack” as a severe and separate form of aggression. For this reason, non-binding UN Resolution 3314 of the 1974 (“Definition of Aggression”) remains relevant for defining the term “armed attack.” Article I provides that “[a]ggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition.” Article II provides that “the First use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression” (unless the UN Security Council determines otherwise) while Article III goes on to list some examples of acts of aggression—like invasion, bombardment, blockade of ports, sending troops or mercenaries in another state, et cetera.\nThis paper will not delve any further on the general concept of “armed attack,” the previous discussion should adequately convey the complexity of this concept, which becomes even more challenging when applied to cyberattacks. Furthermore, imminence and immediacy are crucial; the right to use self-defense arises when an “armed attack” is ongoing or impending. The latter is commonly referred to as anticipatory self-defense (“Caroline Test”). Lastly, when evaluating\n206. Oil Platforms (Iran v.

APPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF “ARMED ATTACK” TO CYBERATTACKS\nIn modern conflicts, cyberattacks can disrupt critical information assets, communications, and weapons systems. Cyberattacks can also cause political disruption by targeting finance, energy, transportation, and government services, thus creating social unrest. In sum, a cyberattack can inflict damage well beyond that of a single bombardment. Can a cyberattack be classified as \"an armed attack\" under the UN Charter? Our discussion centers on cyberattacks existing independently of larger warfare contexts, such as the Ukrainian war. The focus is on singular or multiple cyberattacks that, devoid of any other military actions, could be perceived as acts of aggression against national security.\nThe possibility for a cyberattack to rise to the level of an \"armed attack\" relevant under the UN Charter is the object of some debate. This paper takes the position that a satellite cyberattack can constitute—in\nthe sinking of an American steamboat (Caroline) used by Canadian insurgents, on orders of the British, caused a famous exchange of letters between United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British representative Lord Ashburton. *Id.* That correspondence is referred to as establishing the elements of the customary international right of self-defense. Webster wrote to Ashburton: \"Under these circumstances, and under those immediately connected with the transaction itself, it will be for her majesty's government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of national law, the destruction of the 'Caroline' is to be defended. It will be for that government to show a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" *Id.*\n. This paper does not discuss another self-defense restriction: a state invoking self-defense, must quickly inform the UN Security Council. The Council, under Chapter VII, is chiefly responsible for authorizing force in situations jeopardizing global peace, making decisions to maintain or restore it, potentially endorsing force if needed.\n.

According to several scholars, cyberattacks can rise to the level of “armed attacks” as the UN Charter’s regulation regarding the use of force can be expanded to encompass cyberattacks conducted by one state against another through interpretative means. Several states share this position. For example, the United Kingdom asserted that, under specific circumstances, a cyberattack can be considered the equivalent of an “armed attack” triggering the right of self-defense. Ireland has adopted the “scale and effect” test, stating that use of force “may include instances where a cyber-operation does not cause physical damages such as where there is significant impairment of functionality of critical infrastructure.” “The circumstances under which non-injurious and non-destructive cyber operations might reach the use of force threshold remains a point of uncertainty among States.” However, only in “exceptional circumstances” could a cyber operation “reach this threshold.” France asserted that the threshold for the use of force in cyberspace is not solely determined by the digital tools employed, but by the impact of the cyber operation itself. If the effects of a cyber operation resemble those of traditional weaponry, it breaches the prohibition on using force between states. France acknowledges that even without physical consequences, a cyber operation could qualify as a use of force, in case of severe economic cyber impacts. France also declared the need to evaluate several criteria, including the operation’s origin, instigator’s nature, intrusion level, intended effects, and target, determines this assessment. Singapore proclaimed that the factors to consider are several, including the context during the cyber operation, its origin, the intended or actual impact, the level of intrusion, and the characteristics of the target. Singapore and Norway also recognized the possibility of severe economic cyber impacts being seen as an “armed attack.”\nBeyond general views expressed on the topic as discussed above, there are no official statements from states regarding specific instances of cyberattacks. Consequently, experts have sought to bridge this gap in state practice by offering their insights on how international law applies in this domain. Particularly authoritative in this debate is\n218.

SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE\nSpace has not seen direct armed conflict yet, but, unfortunately, it may be only a matter of time. As the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report put it:\nWe know from history that every medium—air, land and sea—has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different. Given this virtual certainty, the U.S. must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space. This will require superior space capabilities.\nCurrently, “despite international efforts to stem . . . militarization, outer space is now seen by some as a viable theater of future warfare,\nnature of the connection, if any, between the cyber activity and the particular armed conflict in question”). Egan points out that a growing number of states, as evidenced by various GGE reports, are acknowledging the applicability of international law to cyberspace, but seldom states openly express their views on the application of this law to particular cyber activities. Id. at 170–71. The UN GGE is a “Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) that deals with cyber issues in the context of international security.” Id. at 170.\n225.

While it would seem generally accepted that, akin to physical conflicts, nations possess an inherent right to self-defense in the event of cyberattacks, the boundary of this right remains uncertain in international law, especially on whether the use of force is justified in response to a cyberattack.\n1. Rule 51 (Self-defence against armed attack) Application to Cyberattacks\nWhile Article 51 UN Charter broadly encompasses various forms of attacks, including cyberattacks, the Tallinn Manual appropriately clarifies that a state targeted by a cyberattack maintains the right to self-defense. Rule 71 (“Self-defence against armed attack”) provides: “A State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.” Some states have taken a stance on the right of self-defense in the case of cyberattacks. In 2018, the United Kingdom released the following statement: “It is clear that cyber operations that result in, or present an imminent threat of, death and destruction on an equivalent scale to an armed attack will give rise to an inherent right to take action in self-defence, as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The United Kingdom firmly believes that cyber operations leading to, or posing an immediate risk of, severe harm or destruction comparable to an “armed attack” warrant the inherent right to respond in self-defense, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. Canada also recognizes “that the inherent right of self-defence if an ‘armed attack’ occurs against a state also applies in cyberspace.”\n230.

Id.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nEstablishing attribution in case of a cyberattack that raises to the level of an armed attack is just as difficult as it in case of a cyberattack that does not raise to the level of an armed attack, as we discussed above. Technical attribution is difficult because a cyberattack can be launched from anywhere and perpetrators are often able to conceal their identity, and equally difficult is the attribution to a particular country. However, because in an armed conflict “cyberattacks frequently accompany and facilitate conventional attacks, attribution is less problematic when an armed conflict is already undergoing.”\nThis paper discussed how self-defense requires imminence and immediacy, i.e. application of the Caroline Test. Self-defense in case of a cyberattack is no exception. Rule 73 (“Imminence and immediacy”) of the Tallinn Manual provides, “[t]he right to use force in self-defense arises if a cyber armed attack occurs or is imminent. It is further subject to a requirement of immediacy.” This paper also discussed how proportionality and necessity are also an issue in self-defense. Just as with a physical attack, the response of a targeted state to a cyberattack must align with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, the state is allowed only to take actions necessary to halt the attack or prevent additional ones. Rule 72 (“Necessity and proportionality”) of the Tallinn Manual provides “[a] use of force involving cyber operations undertaken by a State in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate.”\nAs the scope of a legitimate self-defense in cyberspace is debatable, afflicted countries are generally cautious when responding to cyberattacks due to the potential for escalation. Typically, diplomatic avenues are prioritized over immediate military or cyber counterattacks in retaliation. Lastly, as for physical attacks, collective self-defense (e.g., NATO) is also allowed.\n237. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67.\n238. See supra Part III(E)(1).\n239. See supra Part III(E)(1).\n240.

Ius in Bello and Its Application to Satellite Cyberattacks\nThe *ius in bello* governs the conduct of the hostilities, and has evolved over centuries. The *jus in bello* includes the laws of armed conflict (“LOAC”), alternatively known as international humanitarian law (“IHL”). This paper takes the position that IHL applies to conflicts in outer space, considering that the ICJ held that the IHL “applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future.” Consistent is the Tallinn Manual, which unambiguously provides that “[c]yber operations executed in the context of an armed conflict are subject to the law of armed conflict.” However, contrary opinions exist. There is limited discourse on applying IHL to satellites in lunar or other celestial bodies’ orbits, which is not surprising considering the early stage of the lunar economy and the presence of only a few satellites around the Moon. However, once the principle of IHL applying in outer space is accepted, there is no reason to restrict IHL application to Earth’s orbits.\nThis paper only briefly outlines IHL principles and examines their application in space, specifically focusing on satellites. The following discussion will briefly cover: (1) military necessity; (2) distinction; (3) proportionality; (4) precautions; (5) the principle of constant care; and (6) the principle of avoiding widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment. Military necessity mandates that any action in an international armed conflict must be justified as necessary to gain a clear military advantage. Distinction requires a clear differentiation between civilians and combatants, as well as civilian and military objectives with operations directed solely at military objects. Military objectives are those contributing to military action through their nature, location, purpose, or use, and when their (partial or total) destruction, capture, or neutralization provides a clear military advantage. Rule 93 of the Tallinn Manual clarifies that\n246. Frans G. von der Dunk, *Armed Conflicts in Outer Space: Which Law Applies?*, 97 INT’L L.

Scholars note that sometimes the purpose of a space object is unclear, and a civilian or commercial space object can be easily converted to military use by reprogramming it to handle military data. Regarding the \"definitive military advantage\" requirement, the challenge in space arises from the potential for shifting object locations, changing ownership, or altered circumstances that may render the destruction of a space object no longer providing a clear military advantage. Complications arise from the dual-use nature of many space objects, serving both military and civilian roles (like the GPS system). Dual-use objects are considered military targets under the principle of distinction. However,\n254. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 93 (\"Distinction\").\n255. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 99 (\"Prohibition of attacking civilian objects\"). Rule 100 (\"Civilian objects and military objectives\") distinguishes civilian objects from military objectives. Civilian objects encompass everything that is not a military objective. Military objectives are objects that, due to their nature, location, purpose, or use, significantly contribute to military actions and their destruction, capture, or neutralization at the time provides a clear military advantage. Cyber infrastructure can potentially be categorized as a military objective. Id.\n256. Georgeson &amp; Stubbs, supra note 80, at 615.\n257. Id. (internal citation omitted).\n258. Id. at 616.\n259.

Koplow, ASAT-isfection, supra note 88, at 1194 (making the point that dual use, i.e. when an object serves both military and civilian needs, is common for the United States but also for other countries). Among the countries that utilized dual-use satellites is Russia. See generally Zak, supra note 175 (mentioning that the line between civilian and military use of most Russian orbital assets is often unclear). Applications like communications, navigation, remote sensing, and weather forecasting are crucial for both sectors. These assets can be considered dual-use since government-controlled entities use them for various purposes. Id. at 4. The same author, on the other hand, notes that \"Russia operates a fleet of communications satellites dedicated exclusively to the military\" Id. at 23. The author points out that GLONASS, the Russian GNSS system, is dual use. Id. at 27. The same, however, is true for the Chinese Beidou and the American GPS.

This is consistent with the provision of the Tallinn Manual in point of cyber infrastructure. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 101 (\"Objects used for civilian and military purposes\"). \"Cyber infrastructure used for both civilian and military purposes is a military objective.\" Id. Rule 112 (\"Clearly separated and distinct military objectives\") is also significant, providing that \"[a] cyber attack that treats as a single target a number of clearly discrete cyber military objectives in cyber infrastructure primarily used for\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nevaluating whether those objects can be disrupted requires weighing other principles like proportionality, precautions, and ongoing care. Proportionality dictates that an attack should not result in excessive collateral damage to civilians or non-military objects, in relation to the expected, specific, and direct military advantage. The assessment necessitates weighing projected civilian losses against military gains, taking into account all available information.\nRule 113 of the Tallinn Manual dictates the prohibition to perform a “cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.” When a satellite is dual-use, proportionality is a significant concern because an attack on such a system could result in substantial civilian impact, making proportionality a potential barrier to attacking those objects. Precautions mandate attackers to exercise caution in their choice of attack methods, and presents a significant obstacle to targeting space objects, particularly due to the potential creation of space debris—a likely outcome if we are talking of kinetic attacks. Scholars suggest that a kinetic attack on a ground station might be the preferred method to achieve a clear military advantage while adhering to the principle of precautions. Rule 121 of the Tallinn Manual mandates the implementation of precautions as well.\nSatellite cyberattacks could be a viable option under the principle of precautions as it can blind satellites without generating debris. The principle of constant care (“requiring that constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians, and civilian objects”) requires evaluation of the impact on civilians, even when they are not in close proximity. This affects the proportionality balance. Rule 114 of the Tallinn Manual dictates that “during hostilities involving\ncivilian purposes is prohibited if to do so would harm protected persons or objects.” Id. at Rule 112 (“Clearly separated and distinct military objectives”).\n262.

Though not the main focus, IHRL factors like necessity, proportionality, precautions, and investigations are likely to impact decisions on satellite attacks, including cyberattacks. Applying IHRL to space raises concerns about potential violations of the right to life if individuals are killed through satellite targeting.\nIn conclusion, satellite cyberattacks generally adhere to most IHL principles, except potentially the principle of proportionality. The significant repercussions of destroying certain satellites, like the GPS system, may pose challenges due to their impact on the broader civilian population, potentially violating the principle of proportionality. When considering cyberattacks on lunar satellites, several critical factors come into play. The vast distance to the Moon necessitates autonomous operations, making immediate human intervention improbable.\n271. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 114 (“Constant Care”).\n272.

Id. at 628.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nAdditionally, the Moon presents harsh conditions, and any disruption to critical lunar satellites could result in catastrophic consequences. The implications of an attack on lunar satellites might not align with IHL principles, particularly concerning proportionality, as the magnitude of possible outcomes would far exceed acceptable limits, potentially causing indiscriminate harm. This raises concerns about the compatibility of such actions with the established framework of IHL. Furthermore, the growing lunar economy and increased human presence on the Moon will magnify the significance of IHRL concerns. As the utilization of lunar resources expands and human activities on the Moon increase, IHRL considerations are likely to emerge as pressing issues that need careful examination.\n## V. THE OUTER SPACE TREATY AND THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES VIS-À-VIS SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n## A. THE OST PROVISIONS RELEVANT FOR SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n### 1. Articles II, III, VIII, and IX of the OST\nThis paper examines now the regulations governing outer space, primarily outlined in the OST, which apply during both peacetime and wartime. Thus, it is a crucial consideration when addressing cyberthreats to satellites. However, this paper takes the position that the principles of *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* are “the *lex specialis* during armed conflict and prevail over the general law of outer space.” Several provisions potentially impact the issue of cyberattacks on lunar satellites. First, Article II of the OST, which likely aimed at preventing the “colonization” of outer space, and which specifies, “[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.” The prevailing view asserts that this non-appropriation principle applies to both States and private\n. See, e.g., *id.* at 649 (citing to Michael N. Schmitt, *International law and military operations in space*, 10 Max Planck Y.B. U.N. L. 89 (2006); Dale Stephens &amp; Cassandra Steer, *Conflicts in space international humanitarian law and its application to space warfare*, 40 Annals Air &amp; Space L. 71 (2015); Macak, *Silent War*, supra note 250.).\n.

See Eller, supra note 167.\n. OST, supra note 17, at Art. II.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nSecond, Article III of the OST, which mandates that states conduct activities in line with international law—including the UN Charter—and aims to uphold international peace, security, cooperation, and understanding. As a result of this provision, the use of force and its threat are forbidden under Article 2.4 of the UN Charter, except as permitted by Article 51 (pertaining to self-defense) and decisions of the UN Security Council.\nThird, Article VIII OST, which stipulates that a state retains jurisdiction and control over an object launched into outer space under its registry. This registration implies authority over the registered object. Consequently, a satellite circling the Moon falls under the jurisdiction of the state that officially registered it. This provision establishes a form of jurisdiction similar to the concept of a “flag” state, resembling territorial control over the registered space object\n282. See, e.g., Ricky J. Lee, Article II of the Outer Space Treaty: Prohibition of State Sovereignty, Private Property Rights, or Both, 11 AUSTL. INT’L L.J. 128, 129 (2004) (highlighting how the prohibition must include private entities: because per Article VI, “any act of national appropriation by private entities would be subject to the direction or influence of the State”).\n283. See, e.g., Stephen Gorove, Interpreting Article II of the Outer Space Treaty, 37 FORDHAM L. REV. 349 (1969). The basis of the argument is the adjective “national” in the language “national appropriation.” Id.\n284. See supra Part III(E)(2).\n285. See supra Part IV(A).\n286. OST, supra note 17, at Art. III.\n287. COLOGNE COMMENTARY ON SPACE LAW: Vol. I 65 (Stephan Hobe et al., eds., Carl Heymanns Verlag 2009) [hereinafter COLOGNE COMMENTARY I].\nA major imperative for declaring international law, including the UN charter, applicable to outer space, was the overriding concern for the maintenance of international peace and security, which, after all, is the primary purpose and responsibility of the United Nations (UN) and the fear for an arms race in outer space. Thus, generally accepted rules and principles, such as the prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defense, would also be in force in outer space. Id. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n288. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n289.

SPACE L. 323, 328 (2014).\nThe registry of a space object has the same legal consequences as registering a ship or an aircraft. The only difference is that in Space Law, inclusion in the national registry does not confer nationality de jure to the spacecraft, only jurisdiction and control thereon. However, in practice such inclusion entitles the State of registry to exercise its sovereignty over the registered object. This amounts to a quasi-nationality or nationality de facto of the space object.\nId.\n290. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nakin to an airplane flagged with a particular state. Notably, Article VIII applies solely to “launched” objects, excluding items constructed in space. Therefore, it will not be applicable to satellites constructed directly in lunar orbits.\nFourth, Article IX: this paper will only briefly mention the principle of due regard. “In the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty . . . shall conduct all their activities in outer space . . . with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty.” Due regard, akin to a primary “duty of care,” stands as a potential mechanism for international responsibility regarding wrongful acts. For example, if State A (or one of its nationals) conducts a cyberattack on a lunar satellites of State B (or one of its nationals), State A would not show proper consideration for the activity of State B. This would violate the obligation of due regard, activating the secondary rule of responsibility previously addressed. The exact scope of due regard remains unclear as this provision has never been used, resulting in a dearth of established State practices. In practice, State parties seem hesitant or unwilling to directly acknowledge the concept of “due regard.”\n## 2. Article IV(1) of the OST\nThe only substantive provision of the OST dealing with military use is Article IV, which (1) prohibits placing in orbit/installing/stationing (as opposed to transiting) nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction in space; (2) requires using the Moon and other celestial bodies (but not empty space) “exclusively for peaceful purposes”; and\n291. Id.\n292. OST, supra note 17, at Art. IX. Among other deliberate omissions, this paper does not discuss the harmful interference principal also established by Article IX OST. The harmful interference principle provides that States can engage in international consultations if their space-related activities foreseeably interfere with other nations’ endeavors. Similarly, a State can request consultations if it believes another country’s space actions might disrupt peaceful space exploration. While this clause has potential relevance for lunar satellites, this paper does not discuss it because, for the way in which Article IX is framed, the provision would seem to refer to involuntary interference and not a cyberattack.\n293.

See supra Part III(A).\n296. Listner, The Paradox of Article IX, supra note 294, at 28 (discussing States’ reluctance to resort to Article IX OST).\n297. Member states have interpreted “peaceful” as “non-aggressive” not as “nonmilitary.” See, e.g., Fabio Tronchetti, *Legal aspects of the military uses of outer space*, in *HANDBOOK OF SPACE LAW* (Frans von der Dunk, ed., Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015), at 331–81.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nWhile more specific than other provisions of the OST, Article IV uses general language and lacks crucial definitions, especially as it pertains to terms such as \"weapons of mass destructions,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"military.\"298 Article IV(1) establishes a ban on certain types of weapons in space (\"nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\"), which cannot be placed \"in orbit around the earth,\" installed \"on celestial bodies,\" \"or stationed in outer space in any other manner.\"299 It does not impose restrictions on non-weapons of mass destruction.300\nArticle IV(1) of the OST has no bearing on the capacity to protect lunar satellites against cyberattacks. In fact, neither nuclear weapons nor weapons of mass destruction are requisite for deterring cyberattacks on lunar satellites. Not only are these weapons unnecessary, but they would also run counter to the principle of proportionality, which governs both the employment of countermeasures for international wrongful acts and the lawful response to \"armed attacks\" in self-defense.\n## 3. Article IV(2) of the OST\nArticle IV(2) of the OST provides that \"the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes\" and bans \"[t]he establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies.\" It provides two exceptions to this overarching prohibition: (1) \"[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,\" and (2) \"[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.\"\nArticle IV(2) of the OST could potentially impact the capacity for deterrence and defense against cyberattacks if it were deemed applicable to orbital regions—a stance this paper does not support—as elucidated below. Before delving into the rationale for this position, let us assess the implications of Article IV(2) of the OST within the specific\n298.

In providing that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used . . . exclusively for peaceful purposes,” the provision would seem to exclude the possibility to militarily defend the assets. Even assuming that this provision does indeed pertain to orbital regions, this provision should not be construed as limiting the right of self-defense. First, the right of self-defense is a well-established norm of customary international law, solidified in Article 51 UN Charter. Its significance and authority are unlikely to be susceptible to influence by a provision framed in such broadly general terms as Article IV(2). Therefore, the right of self-defense must exist in outer space (contrary views exist). Second, in case of an armed conflict, ius ad bellum and ius in bello are lex specialix that prevail the OST. Article 103 of the UN Charter provides that in cases where members of the United Nations have conflicting obligations under the current Charter and other international agreements, the obligations under the UN Charter shall prevail. Third, the term “peaceful” under Article IV(2) should be interpreted as “non-aggressive” and not “as non-military.” The term “peaceful” also appears in the Preamble, Article IX, and Article XI. However, it is only in Article IV(2) that the term “peaceful” is paired with “exclusively,” creating a distinct regulatory emphasis on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Some scholars have pointed out that this is significant to give a special regime to the Moon and other celestial bodies, no matter how the term “peaceful” is interpreted within the OST, the crucial point lies in how Article IV(2) combines it with the term “exclusively.”\n301. This contrary view states that self-defense on celestial bodies is limited by Article IV OST. See, e.g., Arjen Vermeer, The Laws of War in Outer Space: Some Legal Implications for the Jus ad Bellum and the Jus in Bello of the Militarisation and Weaponisation of Outer Space, in THE NEW ORDER OF WAR (2010) at 6 (arguing that “Article IV OST precludes offensive and defensive military activity on celestial bodies”). See also Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 354 (citing authorities that question the applicability of the right of self-defense in outer space).\n302. While Article 103 talks of “obligations” and not “rights” under the convention, because Article 51 is complementary to Article 2.4 (ban on use of force and threat thereof), Article 103 should be read as to make Article 51 prevail over inconsistent provisions, too. Different interpretations are possible.\n303. See, e.g., Matthew G. Looper, International Space Law: How Russia and the U.S. are at Odds in the Final Frontier, 18 S.C. J. INT’L. L. &amp; BUS. 111, 113 (2022) (“Looper, International Space Law”).

Contrary view exists. See, e.g., Vermeer supra note 301.\n304. Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 340 (arguing that the combination of these terms holds significance, as the provision specifies that the moon and other celestial bodies should be utilized “exclusively for peaceful purposes only,” not “exclusively peaceful purposes”). This wording clarifies that any activity remains lawful as long as it maintains peaceful intent; however, once non-peaceful aspects are introduced, its legality is forfeited. In essence, the moon and other celestial bodies are intended to remain devoid of any military utilization. Id. See also, Marko G. Markoff, Disarmament and Peaceful\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nAlso, the second part of Article IV(2) poses no hindrance to the deterrence and defense of lunar satellites. It explicitly prohibits the utilization of celestial bodies for military bases, weapon testing, and military maneuvers. Arguably, deterrence and protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks are unlikely to necessitate the establishment\nPurposes Provisions in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, Spring 1976, Number 1, at 3, 16 (internal quotation omitted) (arguing that \"this use . . . excludes all kinds of military, and not only warlike activities on planets other than the Earth\"); Bin Cheng, Properly Speaking, Only Celestial Bodies Have Been Reserved for Use Exclusively for Peaceful (Non-Military) Purposes, but Not Outer Void Space, 75 INT'L.

Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War is commonly cited as the inaugural \"space war\" because of the extensive utilization of space-based capabilities throughout the conflict. The effective deployment of space technologies by the United States military, notably the Global Positioning System (\"GPS\"), played a pivotal role in earning this distinction.

However, if that were the case, the two explicitly stated exceptions to this provision would come into play. As mentioned, these exceptions are as follows: (1) “[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,” and (2) “[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.” Either of these exceptions provides ample flexibility to permit deterrence and protection of lunar satellites. In fact, the satellites slated for deployment around the Moon, at least initially, will serve “scientific research or other peaceful purposes,” such as experiments and enabling lunar mining. An argument can be constructed, therefore, that the deployment of “military personnel” essential for deterring and defending these satellites should fall under this exception. Additionally, under the second exception, the use of any equipment or facility necessary for deterring attacks on and safeguarding these satellites should also be permissible, even if generally prohibited by the overarching provision of the latter part of Article IV(2) because at least initially the lunar satellites will be “necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon.”\nFurthermore, this paper argues that Article IV(2) exclusively applies to the Moon and celestial bodies themselves and does not encompass lunar orbits (as well as the orbits of other planets).[310] Lunar orbits and similar regions can be arguably considered part of empty outer space, exclusively covered by Article IV(1). Consequently, if the need for military defense against cyberattacks on lunar satellites were to arise, it would be legal to station military personnel and equipment in the vicinity of the Moon or lunar orbit (as opposed to the lunar surface). There are several reasons why Article IV(2) does not extend to these orbits. First, the general principle is that Article I of the OST's freedom of use applies to \"empty outer space,\"[311] while the regulation of celestial bodies is the exception. Given that Article IV(2) contains an exception to a general principle, it should be narrowly construed. Second, at least some orbits (i.e., Earth's orbit) have been used \"militarily\" since the inception of the space age, and no state has significantly objected to that use.[312] Therefore, state practice supports the argument that orbits are empty outer space and are not covered by Article IV(2). According to Article 31.3(b) of the Vienna Convention on\n310. See, e.g., COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 81–82 (making the argument that outer space is not covered by Article IV(2)).\n311.

Different opinions exist. See, e.g., Michael Listner, The Moon Treaty: failed international law or waiting in the shadows?, THE SPACE REV. (Oct. 24, 2011), https://www.thespacereview.com/article/1954/1 [hereinafter Listner, The Moon Treaty] (\"arguing that although only a few nations ratified the Moon Treaty, the participation of countries like Australia, France, and India as signatories create \"a shadow of customary law which could grow\" so that non-parties may be influenced by the Moon Treaty's shadow if they do not challenge its legitimacy\").\n315. Article 3 of the Moon Agreement provides:\n1. The moon shall be used by all States Parties exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n2. Any threat or use of force or any other hostile act or threat of hostile act on the moon is prohibited. It is likewise prohibited to use the moon in order to commit any such act or to engage in any such threat in relation to the earth, the moon, spacecraft, the personnel of spacecraft or man-made space objects.\n3. States Parties shall not place in orbit around or other trajectory to or around the moon objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction or place or use such weapons on or in the moon.\n4. The establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military maneuvers on the moon shall be forbidden. The use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited. The use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration and use of the moon shall also not be prohibited.\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nnecessity of using lunar orbit for lunar activities may seem logical. However, this argument is less compelling compared to the opposing view supported by the reasons mentioned earlier.\n## B. THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE ARRANGEMENTS\n### 1. The Other Space Treaties\nAfter the OST was enacted in 1967, several other significant treaties were signed between 1968 and 1976. These treaties, namely the Rescue Agreement, Liability Convention, and Registration Convention, also pertain to Moon activities and Moon satellites. None of these treaties are highly pertinent to the subject of this paper, except for the Liability Convention, which could be relevant if a cyber-attack results in measurable damage for which the victim-state seeks compensation.\nIn 1979—the Moon Agreement was signed—and it could have had the potential to significantly influence the subject of this paper. However, this treaty ultimately failed due to the limited number of ratifications. Therefore, while differing opinions exist, this paper contends that the dismissal of the Moon Agreement by the vast majority of states (including all major space-faring nations except India and Australia) renders it largely irrelevant for our analysis. However, as previously discussed, it can still serve a purpose when employed in a contrasting manner to enhance our understanding of the interpretation of OST. In other words, if the Moon Agreement found it necessary to address a particular issue, it implies that the OST does not cover that aspect.\n### 2.

Section 5 (“Interoperability”) provides that the Signatories acknowledge that the use of compatible and shared exploration infrastructure and standards (including standard for communication systems) advances exploration, scientific research, and commercial utilization. Therefore the Signatories commit to strive to employ existing interoperability standards, or to create new standards when current ones are absent or insufficient. Interoperability enhances cybersecurity and therefore, by providing this commitment, the Artemis Accords significantly increase protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks. Section 11 (“Deconfliction of Space Activities”), and in particular, Sections 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 are relevant. First, in Section 11.1, the Signatories reconfirm their commitment to the OST with alignment on provisions such as due regard and prevention of harmful interference. Second, in Section 11.3 the Signatories reaffirm the commitment to use due regard, as per Article IX of the OST. Section 11.3 also provides that if a Signatory fears or has suffered harmful interference, that Signatory can initiate a consultation with the other Signatory that authorized the activity (or any party to the OST). Lastly, Section 11.4 commits the Signatories to avoid deliberate actions that could lead to harmful interference with each other’s utilization of outer space. The impact of the above principles on cybersecurity for lunar satellites is undeniable.\ncooperation%20on%20Artemis %20is,of%20the%20 Outer%20Space%20Treaty (last visited Oct 28, 2023).\n.

DEFENDING MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITES\n## A. UNITED STATES' SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY AND DEFENSE\nWhile the attitude of the U.S. towards space exploration and use is peaceful, the United States has repeatedly reaffirmed its right to take countermeasures, its right of self-defense, and its intention to use these rights in case its space activities are threatened. For years, the U.S. has recognized the vulnerability of space objects to both physical attacks and cyberattacks. Already in 2001, the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report pointed out that “with the growing commercial and national security use of space, U.S. assets in space and on the ground offer just such targets. The U.S. is an attractive candidate for a ‘Space Pearl Harbor.’” The concept of space as a domain at risk is repeated in many documents of military doctrine:\n[I]n the contested, congested, and competitive space warfighting domain, our potential adversaries continue to develop, test, and proliferate sophisticated weapons. These weapons have the potential to be the most severe risks to orbital flight. To minimize this risk, it is imperative we execute threat-focused space operations that are fully integrated with timely and relevant intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.\nPresident Obama’s National Space Policy (“2010 NSP”) emphasizes the safeguarding of space assets mentioning the following necessities: (1) to ensure cost-effective resilience of space capabilities based on their planned use, potential consequences of capability loss, threat levels, and the availability of alternative means to fulfill missions; and (2) to develop and employ strategies and capabilities for the safeguard of critical national security space-dependent missions, including rapid asset restoration and leveraging diverse resources for mission execution. The 2010 NSP suggests proliferation of space capabilities as\n. 51 U.S.C. § 20102 (“Congressional declaration of policy and purpose”) provides that “Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.” *Id.*\n.

If deterrence fails, the right to self-defense is invoked in accordance with international law and treaty obligations.[334] The 2011 NSSS specified that, although the U.S. believes that all space-faring nations should strive to prevent space hostilities, it acknowledges that some actors might still see military advantage in space-based actions.[335] In 2018, the Trump Administration issued the U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy,[336] and instituted the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency.[337] Specifically on cybersecurity for space, the Trump Administration issued Space Policy Directive 5 - Cybersecurity Principles for Space System (\"SPD-5\"), which focused on cybersecurity for space systems and urged federal agencies and non-governmental space operators to establish cybersecurity norms.[338]\nIn 2020, the National Space Policy (\"2020 NSP\")[339] reaffirmed the right of self-defense providing that if any adversary jeopardizes the advantages that the U.S. gains from space, the U.S. will use all means to deter and, if needed, overcome hostile actions in space. The U.S. will continue to use space for national security, including the right of self-defense, as unfettered access and operational freedom in space\n333.

The 2020 NSP specifies that the U.S. regards intentional interference with space systems (including their support and infrastructure) as a violation of its national rights.\nThe focus of the 2020 NSP is on deterring and countering threats to the U.S. and their allies' space interests; it clarified that any attack on, or intentional interference with, these interests will be met with a calculated response at a time, place, and manner according to U.S. discretion. A cyberattack of a satellite is obviously an attack/intentional interference with a space system and will therefore be considered an infringement of the U.S.' rights. The U.S. will seek to deter that threat, but if unsuccessful will respond appropriately, and not necessarily in kind.\nThe 2020 NSP emphasizes the U.S.' intention of developing plans and capabilities to counter any interference or attack on U.S. or allied space systems, especially those vital for critical infrastructure, enabling a responsive approach as determined by the U.S. The 2020 NSP highlights that the U.S. aims for a secure, stable, and open space environment. It also recognizes that the space domain has evolved into a \"warfighting domain\" due to the actions of competitors. Noting the critical importance of space security for both U.S. and global stability, the 2020 NSP outlines the need for the U.S. to enhance its security systems, policies, and strategies to safeguard its space interests, dictating specific principles. The 2020 NSP designates Space Force as the main military branch for space, with the responsibility to organize, train, and equip forces to protect national interests in space and ensure access to space. Space Force will also supply forces for offensive, defensive, and support operations to U.S. Space Command and other commands. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with protecting the use of space for U.S. national security, economic interests, and those of allies and partners. The 2020 NSP also places significant emphasis on cybersecurity, committing to integrate it into all aspects of the space\n340. Id. at 3.\n341. Id.\n342. Id. at 3-4.\n343. Id. at 9.\n344.

Recognizing that the convergence of the digital and physical realms poses a risk to national systems, the 2023 NCSS establishes three key principles:\n(1) obtaining global recognition that international law is applicable in cyberspace in times of peace or war; (2) obtaining consensus on norms of responsible behavior; and (3) promoting trust-building measures for inter-state cooperation. With specific reference to space, the 2023 NCSS notes how reliance on space assets is increasing cyberrisks, and the transition of numerous critical systems to digital platforms is exacerbating the potential damage from cyberattacks.\nThe 2023 NCSS also points out the increasing reliance of the government on the commercial sectors for national security needs.

For the purpose of this paper, Pillar Two is the most important because it: (1) outlines the U.S. strategy to employ all available means (including diplomacy, information, finance, intelligence, and law enforcement) to deter potential attackers from jeopardizing U.S. interests, and to halt malicious actors from conducting extended cyber-campaigns that are a threat to national security and public safety;[356] (2) expresses the U.S.' intention to execute continuous and precisely targeted \"disruption campaigns\" to dissuade cybercriminals from engaging in cyber-activities (including by making those activities unprofitable);[357] (3) promotes the private sector's collaboration via nonprofit organizations as central hubs for cooperation with the Government;[358] (4) highlights the Government's commitment to disrupt ransomware activities by rendering them unprofitable.[359] Pillar Three[360] deals with shaping market forces to drive security and resilience, (including insurance program),[361] while Pillar Four focuses on investments and incentives.[362]\nImplementation actions are necessary. In 2023 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") issued Introduction to Cybersecurity for Commercial Satellite Operations,[363] a document setting non-binding standards which lack specificity.

NATO’s POSITION\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), established in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty, is a political and military alliance created as a collective defense organization among North American and European countries, totaling thirty-two members. Collective defense is NATO’s bedrock: NATO members pledge to consider an attack against any of its members as an attack against all, triggering a duty to respond collectively. Equally significant is the aspect of defense planning, meaning that the members collaborate on planning their defense and developing military capabilities against security challenges. Also crucial is the aspect of cooperative security, which means that NATO cooperates with non-member countries and international organizations to promote security and stability, such as conventional military threats, terrorism, and hybrid warfare, and cyberattacks.\nTo comprehend NATO’s stance on cyberattacks targeting satellites, it is essential to recognize that the matter resides at the intersection of NATO’s position on satellite defense and its response to cyberattacks. NATO has been increasingly focused on protecting and defending its members’ satellites, considering that satellites are crucial to communication, navigation, reconnaissance, and military operations. In 2019, NATO officially recognized space as an operational domain “alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace.”\n---\n.

Both satellites and ground-based facilities are potential targets for these threats.371 NATO's goal is not to become an independent space player,372 but to enhance and contribute to the efforts of its member states and collaborate with other pertinent international organizations.373 This includes enhancing space domain awareness374 in cooperation with space agencies and advancing counter-space capabilities and technologies for safeguarding space assets, including cybersecurity defense.\nNATO has reaffirmed its long-standing belief that cyberspace is continuously contested by various state and non-state actors.375 Most notably, NATO's robust engagement in cyber defense and the role of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (\"CCDCOE\") are evidenced by the Tallinn Manual.376 An important example of NATO's approach regarding a specific cyberattack exists. In 2007, Estonia endured a massive cyberattack from Russia, which was likely provoked by the controversial relocation of a Red Army statue to a cemetery. The cyberattacks persisted for weeks, impacting banks, media\ncommunications%2C%20navigation%20%20and%20intelligence (last visited Mar. 16, 2024).\n369. NATO's overarching space policy, N. ATL.

TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIt is challenging to predict what NATO would do in case of a cyberattack on the Moon because it is a vastly different environment compared to Earth, and the impact of a cyberattack on a satellite or group of satellites may vary significantly. Also, on the Moon a cyberattack could be more impactful (due to the scarcity of satellites) or less impactful (due to the limited number of people affected). However, one could make a reasonable argument that if NATO did not view the extensive 2007 cyberattack in Estonia as meeting the criteria for a cyberattack requiring collective self-defense, it would be even more unlikely for NATO to categorize an attack on a lunar satellite in that way.\n## C. OTHER SPACEFARING COUNTRIES VIS-À-VIS LUNAR SATELLITES\n### 1. China\nChina’s progress in space technologies, initially non-military in nature, carries significant military implications because of their dual-use potential. This duality is evident in Chinese space missions like lunar exploration, where technologies developed for these purposes—such as robotics, radar networks, and materials—have the potential for military adaptation. While China may not explicitly articulate military intentions for space in their policies or directives, and consistently advocates for the use of outer space only for “peaceful purposes.”\n. Damien McGuinness, *How a cyber attack transformed Estonia*, BBC NEWS (Apr. 17, 2017), https://www.bbc.com/news/39655415.\n. *China’s White Papers on Space*, supra note 33, at 8. The Chinese White Papers “are silent on China’s policies about Space-based and/or Earth-based weapons for targets in Space. . . . There is no mention of investments in technologies like jamming technology.” *Id.* The truth, however, is that “[t]he emphasis in the White Papers is on the civilian aspects of the Chinese Space programme.” *Id.* at 9.\n. *China’s Space Program: A 2021 Perspective*, THE STATE COUNCIL INFO. OFF. OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (Jan. 28, 2022), www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465645/n6465648/c6813088/content.html (“2021 White Paper”). In section I, subsection 3, China reaffirmed to have “always advocated the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes any attempt to turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield or launch an arms race in outer space.” *Id.* The 2021 White Paper does not address military activities in space and only briefly references the defense of national security.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nChina's practice has suggested otherwise. China has indeed employed space for military objectives, and the military plays a crucial role in the Chinese space program. BeiDou—China's GNSS system—serves as a prime example, demonstrating China's strategic utilization of dual-use technology to bolster its geopolitical influence. Evidence of China's military focus in space includes the recent establishment of the Information Support Force (“ISF”), a military branch aimed at providing strategic support for network information systems under the Central Military Commission’s control to strengthen military capabilities through informatization and intelligence. This reorganization also involved dismantling the Strategic Support Force (“SSF”) and creating the Aerospace Force (“AF”) and Cyberspace Force (“CF”).\nEvidence suggests that China regularly utilizes jamming and spoofing methods on GPS satellites to safeguard sensitive areas from drone surveillance or potential attacks. Additionally, there are reports of China targeting U.S. government satellites on a daily basis. If China gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable China might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well. China has also developed ground-based laser systems designed to dazzle the optical sensors of spy satellites as they pass over sensitive sites to temporarily prevent the satellite from taking a picture or physically damage the image sensor.\n380. See China’s White Papers on Space, supra note 33 at 4 (showing that China’s space program is propelled by multifaceted objectives: advancing space exploration for Earth and beyond, fostering global agreement on peaceful space use and security, meeting economic, scientific, technological, and national security needs, showcasing Chinese scientific and cultural achievements, safeguarding national rights and interests, and bolstering the nation’s overall capabilities).\n381.

Russia\nNotwithstanding numerous declarations to the effect that space must be reserved for peaceful purposes, evidence exists that Russia continues in the militarization of space. Russian space law—largely governed by Federal Law No. 5663—stipulates that space activities must adhere to legal provisions for safeguarding state secrets, military and commercial secrets, intellectual property, and exclusive rights. This suggests that the federal law acknowledges Russia's intention to utilize space for military purposes. Despite some progress in national security space capabilities, the Russian space industry is currently grappling with an era of stagnation.\nLately, Russia has heightened its efforts in developing antisatellite systems, with some of these efforts being publicly disclosed. Additionally, Russia has been engaged in the creation of orbital maneuvering satellites, potentially for tasks related to inspection and interception. The advancement in these technologies not only hints at Russia's intention to target reconnaissance and communication satellites, but also signifies a growing unease within Russia regarding the perceived weaponization of space by others. Given Russia's long history of imperialism, reasonable doubts exist that its advocacy for peace in space might stem more from its current limited space capabilities, rather than from a genuine desire for space to remain a sanctuary. There is evidence suggesting Russia regularly uses jamming and\n386. See supra Part II(A).\n387.

CONCLUSION\nThis paper has delved into the issue of cyber-threats for satellites in non-Earth orbits, particularly in lunar orbits, amid escalating cyber-risks. The growing cislunar and lunar economy will heighten vulnerability, especially for commercial lunar satellites lacking robust protection. Just as Earth-orbiting satellites have faced increasing threats, lunar satellites will be confronted with similar risks in the expanding lunar economy. With a limited number of satellites orbiting the Moon, this paper has drawn insights from threats facing Earth's satellites to anticipate risks for lunar counterparts, focusing specifically on cyberthreats. Cyberthreats pose unique challenges due to attribution complexities and scope of the right of self-defense. This paper has examined cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and as armed attacks, assessing affected states' rights to self-defense. Considering provisions in the UN Charter and the OST, this paper has concluded that Article IV of the OST cannot be interpreted as impeding the right of self-defense of lunar satellites. Even if certain restrictions exist, this paper has argued that the right of self-defense would prevail when constrained by these limitations. Preserving security for both government and commercial satellites remains crucial for U.S. national interests, and it will become paramount on the Moon as well. The recognition that the right of self-defense is not diminished in space is an important component of satellite security.\n. Dong L.

Highlighting the intricate nature of cyber threats and their impact on both governmental and commercial satellites, this paper examines cyberattacks as potential international wrongful acts and armed attacks. This paper evaluates the right of affected states to self-defense and scrutinizes Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty (\"OST\"), alongside other pertinent treaties' provisions. This paper concludes that Article IV of the OST should not be interpreted as to impede the right of self-defense for lunar satellites, and claims that the inherent right of self-defense overrides the OST's restrictions, allowing for protection for lunar satellite assets.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nThis paper discusses the legal issues of protecting satellites in lunar (and other non-earth) orbits from cyberattacks. Lunar satellites are included in the \"cislunar\" space but present special characteristics that differentiate them from the satellites around Earth. This paper focuses on lunar satellites due to the expanding cislunar and lunar economy. This expansion is expected to result in an escalation of cyberrisks for lunar satellites—particularly for commercial ones, which have less robust protection compared to their military counterparts. Similar to Earth-orbiting satellites—upon which our economy has come to rely—which are facing growing threats from competitors and adversaries openly expressing their intention to disrupt these satellites in times of conflict, lunar satellites are likely to face the same threats, with the expansion of the lunar economy.\nDue to the limited number of satellites currently orbiting the Moon, this paper analyses the threats faced by Earth's satellites and derives insights applicable to lunar satellites. Potential adversaries are constantly trying to capitalize on perceived weaknesses in space capabilities, and satellites are exposed to several threats (including physical/kinetic, non-kinetic/physical, electronic, and cyber); however, this paper focuses on\n1. 42 U.S.C. § 18302 (defining \"Cis-lunar space\" as \"the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon\").\n2.

Cyberthreats are different from the other threats because establishing attribution in cyberattack cases is especially difficult, and assessing damages—particularly under the Liability Convention—would be complex, thus making it even more challenging to seek satisfaction. Preserving the security of both governmental and commercial satellites is essential for the United States national interests.\nThis paper will discuss in Part III(E) and Part IV, respectively, cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and cyberattacks as “armed attacks.” In both cases, the affected state has a right to react, albeit with differing degrees of severity. Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”) prohibits use of force or threat thereof. Self-defense (including collective self-defense as in the North Atlantic Treaty) stands as an exception as per Article 51 of the UN Charter, incorporating a fundamental principle within customary international law. This paper examines if a cyberattack qualifies as use of force, granting affected states the right to countermeasures, and, if the cyberattack escalates to an armed attack, whether self-defense permits the use of force or threat thereof.\nThe Preamble of the Outer Space Treaty (“OST”) frames exploration and use of space as an aspirational principle. However, “peaceful purposes” is not defined by the OST. Article IV of the OST—which is a rare instance in which the Moon and other celestial bodies are treated separately and distinct from the empty outer space—is the\n7. Erwin, supra note 4.\n8. The level of attribution varies, with the kinetic/physical attacks being the easiest to attribute, followed by the non-kinetic physical ones, with the electronic and cyber having the most difficult attribution.

First, for lunar communication: in order to maintain contact with assets on the lunar surface, lunar satellites will serve as communication relay stations, enabling data transfer, audio/video communication, and command and control of lunar rovers/other equipment.58 Upcoming lunar missions anticipate reliance on emerging cislunar space networks, comprising a special network for communication including relay satellites, orbiters, and spacecraft.59 With the establishment of a stable presence on the Moon, the communication need will be even more pressing. Before its Chang'e-4 mission, China positioned Queqiao, a relay satellite, into a halo orbit beyond the Moon. Its primary objective was to facilitate communication between Earth-based ground stations and the Far Side, where the Chang'e-4 lander would operate.60 To support its Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8, China launched another relay satellite, named Queqiao-2.61\nSecond, for navigation and positioning: lunar activities (including landing, navigation, mapping, and mining) will likely use satellite systems like Global Navigation Satellite System (\"GNSS\") or lunar-specific positioning systems to provide accurate location information\n56.

In 2011, the U.S. issued a report, revealing that cyber-intruders (possibly connected to Chinese military groups) had disrupted the operations of two U.S. government satellites on four separate occasions in the previous years. Troubling incidents of cyberattacks have happened in connection with the Ukrainian War. Immediately prior the invasion, Russia initiated a massive cyberattack against ViaSat, a satellite company, disabling and infecting all the ground modems responsible for transmitting signals to/from the satellites, rendering the systems inoperable. The attack impacted not only Ukraine (which used ViaSat for military communication) but also other Central and Eastern European nations,\n68. Katherine Fang et al., A Right to Spy?

Amtel-Svyaz, the parent company of Dozor, acted swiftly, taking control of one network while three remained down. Dozor-Teleport did not disclose specific attack details, and it is unclear whether the terrestrial network was affected or the satellites themselves. A self-proclaimed “hacktivist” organization and a branch of the Wagner Group both claimed responsibility, asserting that they sent malicious software to the satellite terminals.74 In 2022, Elon Musk revealed that SpaceX’s Starlink satellites had been subjected to numerous cyberattacks in the wake of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.75\n## B. WHY SATELLITES ARE PARTICULARLY EASY TARGETS FOR CYBERATTACKS\nA satellite could be attacked kinetically or non-kinetically. “Kinetic” means actions involving physical force or direct contact, such as bombings and other types of attacks that cause physical damage, while “non-kinetic” attacks are those that do not involve a direct physical force. A cyberattack—the focus of this paper—is a form of non-kinetic attack being carried out by digital means to compromise, disrupt, or damage data, infrastructure, or communication. The term “cyberattack” has several definitions, including the following: “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident or transiting these systems or networks.” Cyberattacks are performed through malware, hacking, denial-of-service, and other tactics aimed at compromising or disrupting computer systems, networks, and data. A cyberattack can aim at stealing sensitive information, or causing system malfunctions, or blocking the system (unblocking it only after the payment of a sum of money called ransomware).\nCyberattacks are not the only possible form of non-kinetic attacks. Spoofing (use of deceptive or fraudulent electronic data or communications to deceive, manipulate a system, or disguise the attacker’s\n73.

Scholars Georgeson and Stubbs explain that satellites are vulnerable due to several factors: (1) they are typically unshielded; (2) they follow predictable orbits, (3) they have limited maneuverability, (4) they are \"few enough in number\" that their destruction could have substantial repercussions; (5) replacing them is costly and consuming; and (6) numerous satellites have dual-use functionality, providing services to the military and to civilians, making them potential targets for enemy attacks.80\nNot all of the factors mentioned above are equally relevant to protection against cyberattacks. As for shielding:81 while shielding against destructive attacks like kinetic anti-satellite missiles is difficult, protection against non-kinetic attacks is feasible (e.g., to safeguard against electronic attacks, a shutter shield could protect specific sensors or satellite lids; shielding could be effective against blinding lasers or dazzlers). Shielding satellites against kinetic attacks is not only challenging but also costly, as it increases expenses not only during\n76. While different from a cyberattack, spoofing can be used in a cyberattack to trick the system into believing that the source of a cyberattack is a legitimate source. For example, in a phishing attack, attackers may use email spoofing to make an email appear as though it comes from a trusted source.

Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\ndevelopment but also during launch due to the added weight.82 Dissimilarly, protection against cyberattacks does not necessitate an increase in weight, and therefore launch costs. While development expenses are still a consideration, it is crucial for all satellite operators to create a robust cybersecurity system.\nAs for predictability of orbit and fuel scarcity: satellites follow predictable orbits,83 not only due to the laws of physics, but also because they carry limited fuel—which restricts their ability to make significant changes to their orbits. Additionally,84 technical limitations on maneuverability and fuel scarcity result in satellite operators being unable to make rapid maneuvers, even if they detect that an attack is coming.85 Cyberattacks would not be affected by predictability of orbit or limited maneuverability because cyberattacks happen in the \"cyberworld,\" where maneuverability is not necessary; only a robust cybersecurity program is essential.\nIn terms of the limited number (i.e., lack of redundancy of satellites), the landscape is swiftly evolving.86 While satellites remain relatively scarce, LEO constellations are significantly altering this scenario in many instances, making lack of redundancy somewhat less impactful. However, this is not universally applicable to every satellite type or operator. In certain instances, operators might not possess hundreds or thousands of satellites performing the same functions; they might have only a few, which play a pivotal role in providing crucial services.87 All things considered, satellites are still relatively few in number.88\n82.

System redundancy involves incorporating supplementary components, resources, or elements within a satellite that are not strictly essential for its operation but are included to improve reliability, availability, fault tolerance, and overall robustness.[92] Although redundant systems can still be susceptible to cyberattacks,[93] redundancy could mitigate the risk because, if a component is compromised due to a cyberattack, other components might be capable of fulfilling its functions. Today satellites—at least the larger ones—are designed with redundancy in mind.[94]\n[Satellites] are still relatively few in number (so destroying or damaging even a handful could have a major impact); they are \"soft\" (lacking heavy shielding or the ability to defend themselves from attack); they usually follow known, predictable orbital paths, with little ability to undertake evasive maneuvers (so they are easily trackable \"sitting ducks\").\nId.\n89.

Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks;[95] if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands.[96] Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.[97]\nAs for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging.[98] Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.[99]\n## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY\nSatellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation.[100] Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations.[101] In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite.\nConsidering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly.\n95. Peeters, supra note 2 (arguing that \"cyber-attacks on satellites are often related to accessing the satellite system via ground stations\").\n96. Satellite infrastructure consists of ground and space segments, with the ground segment encompassing hardware and software on Earth, and the space segment including the satellite and its onboard systems.

THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF LUNAR SATELLITES\nThis paper has discussed how, as the lunar economy grows, dependable navigation and communication will be crucial for both government and private lunar missions. Currently, lunar orbits remain relatively uncrowded. However, some satellites and orbiters from previous lunar missions are still orbiting the Moon. As of July 2023, there were at least six “active lunar orbiters:” Artemis P1 and Artemis P2 (operating “in eccentric orbits of low inclination”); NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (orbiting “the Moon in a nearly polar, slightly elliptical orbit”); Chandrayaan-2 of the Indian Space Agency and Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (both operating in “in polar orbits of 100 km altitude”); and NASA’s Capstone (having a completely different, and much higher orbit). Additionally, two non-operative spacecrafts (the 2009 Japanese Ouna and the Indian 2008 Chandrayaan-1) currently\n.

Lunar satellites will face geophysical threats coming from the Moon's environment.\nThe main concern is that the Moon is not nearby enough to quickly address these issues. Therefore, planned lunar missions must be sustainable and autonomous. In regards to cybersecurity, when planning lunar missions, scientists and engineers must use various models to approximate real conditions—such as thermal environments, difficulties in communications and navigation systems, placement and maneuvering of the spacecraft, as well as generation and storage of the power. However, uncertainties, unknowns, or unforeseen circumstances on the Moon may pose hazards for lunar missions.\nNo documented cyberthreats have targeted satellites in lunar orbits, but security breaches in space agencies have sparked worries about mission safety. NASA frequently discloses cybersecurity issues, such as unauthorized attempts to access its systems. In 2019, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported a data breach resulting from unauthorized access. Though these incidents might not have caused visible harm, NASA and other government entities and organizations must always focus on safeguarding their digital assets and infrastructure.\nRecognizing the critical role of lunar satellites, the 2022 National Cislunar Science &amp; Technology Strategy (\"NCS&amp;T Strategy\"), in outlining its key objectives, provided for the need to \"implement Cislunar communications and PNT capabilities with scalable and interoperable approaches\" and for the extension of \"space situational awareness capabilities into Cislunar space.\" The NCS&amp;T Strategy contains two specific mentions of cybersecurity, clarifying that cybersecurity is\n.

For example, as addressed above, the predictability of orbits increases the propensity to attacks but; predictability of orbit is not to be considered a problem for cislunar satellites. These satellites have the opposite problem; satellite orbits tend to shift continuously unless they are positioned in proximity of Lagrange points L4 and L5. As the lunar economy advances, both government and commercial satellite operators must remain vigilant in safeguarding their assets, even if they perceive cyber-risks as unlikely. This perception of unlikelihood could pose a particular challenge for commercial actors. Conversely, governments have been concerned about cybersecurity threats since the inception of the space program. The government should be proactive in safeguarding commercial systems in a space protection plan because threats to commercial actors’ lunar\n. Id. at 13.\n. Id.\n. M. J.

Lunar commercial actors may initially show minimal enthusiasm for addressing security concerns, similar to the findings that reflected their lack of interest in discussing security matters for satellites in Earth's orbit, as revealed in a 2018 survey. Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government. While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.\nIn a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon. Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities. Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.\n121. Id. at 18.\n122.

Additionally, governments should consider providing incentives to encourage private entities to implement suitable cybersecurity measures for lunar satellites.\nSecuring lunar satellites is crucial as they determine the safety of lunar operations. Inspired by the ESA's depiction of lunar economic aspects, diverse potential scenarios emerge. ESA lists several “[a]pplication Areas Supporting a Sustainable Lunar Presence.” For example, the Moon will have solar panel farms for the production of electricity, water extraction facilities, manufacturing facilities utilizing regolith as construction material, transportation services, habitation to house humans, food production installations, waste management facilities, health services, educational facilities, entertainment facilities, smart infrastructures, and other services.\nCyber operations on the Moon and other celestial bodies may be conducted only for peaceful purposes.

What potential catastrophic effects might result from a cyberattack that compromises these operations? How concerning would a cyberattack on food production or resource management be? Additionally, what risks would a cyberattack on the smart infrastructure controlling and maintaining lunar facilities pose?

General Discussion Regarding Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nEven if uncertainties exist, numerous states, including the U.S., hold the view that the current international legal framework adequately governs the conduct of states in cyberspace. According to international law, a cyberattack could fall along the spectrum of international responsibility, use of force, and possibly armed attack. The boundaries between these scenarios are not always clearly defined.\nInternational responsibility comes into play when there is a violation of an obligation attributable to a state. An international wrongful act—which is a foundational principle in customary international law—causes a novel legal relationship to arise between states when there is a breach of an international obligation by one of them. In fact, the breach triggers a shift from a primary rule—which is a rule dictating state conduct—to a secondary set of rules of responsibility. Article 2 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ARSIWA”) defines an international wrongful act as a conduct—either action or omission—that is contrary to what a State is required to do by international law, including violations of treaties and customary international law, that is attributable to the State. When the breach is attributable to a state, it initiates a new relationship called a “secondary rule,” which evokes legal consequences for the breaching state. Articles 28–36 of ARSIWA outline the legal ramifications of an internationally wrongful act. The legal framework aims to resolve disputes peaceably without escalating to war. It encompasses the obligation of the breaching state to cease the wrongful conduct, prevent its recurrence, rectify the situation, pay damages, or give satisfaction.\nRule 14 of the Tallinn Manual (“Internationally wrongful cyber acts”) provides that a state bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to a state and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation. The focus is on acts that are less severe than the use of force, but still carry international repercussions, such as the obligation to provide reparation.\n Brian J. Egan, *International Law and Stability in Cyberspace*, 35 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 169, (2017).\n GAOR, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf [hereinafter ARSIWA]. While the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts formulated by the International Law Commission (“ILC”), do not possess inherent legal binding force, they do codify principles of customary international law, which are indeed binding. These principles outline guidelines regarding state responsibility.\n See TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 67, and accompanying text.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\n144. A cyberattack is not a wrongful act in several circumstances, including when it is the result of self-defense, countermeasures, and necessity. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 19 (“Circumstances precluding wrongfulness of cyber operations”).\n145. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 15 (“Attribution of cyber operations by State organs”). “Cyber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” Id.\n146. ARSIWA Articles 4–11 outline when actions by various entities are seen as acts of a state in international law. Articles 4 and 5 encompass actions by state organs or recognized entities, including authorized individuals yielding governmental authority. Articles 6 and 7 clarify that organs provided by one state to another and actions by state entities, even when exceeding authority, are considered state acts. Articles 8 and 9 define state acts as actions under state control or exercised in the absence of official control, both qualifying as state acts. Articles 10 and 11 address actions of insurrectional movements as state acts, attributing related conduct to those states. Lastly, Article 11 specifies that conduct not directly attributed to a state may be recognized as an act of the state if acknowledged and adopted. See also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, Rule 17 (“Attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors”). “Cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control; or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own.” Id.\n147. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 18 (“Responsibility in connection with cyber operations by other States”).\n148. BERGAMASCO, ET AL., CYBERSECURITY: KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, supra note 70, at 119–20 (noting how the practical significance of cyber activities by non-governmental entities is limited because a state can only authorize and oversee cyber activities a state is informed about). Even if these criteria are met, establishing clear attribution for cyber activities, which is often not feasible, remains an unresolved issue. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nThe affected state has the right to take countermeasures, but does not have to respond with a cyberattack. Countermeasures need not be in kind but must not be indiscriminate; their sole purpose should encourage responsible behavior aligned with the affected state's rights. Furthermore, the countermeasures must not violate human rights, or engage in prohibited belligerent actions, breach peremptory norms, or violate diplomatic and consular inviolability. The countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury suffered. and cannot breach a legal obligation owed to a third party.\nSome states have taken a clear position on when cyberattacks constitute an international wrongful act. For example, in 2018, the United Kingdom, declared that cyber operations targeting another state's territory, even below the use of force threshold, can breach international law. Consequently, the affected state, with clear attribution, can take non-forceful, necessary, and proportionate countermeasures directed at the offending state to restore compliance. In 2019, Estonia adopted a similar stance, releasing a statement on countermeasures in the event of a cyberattack. The U.S. made a similar pronouncement in 2021. Ireland followed suit in 2023. France took a similar stance, and went so far as to qualify cyberattacks as a possible violation of sovereignty. Some states also provided extensive declarations regarding the legality\n149. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 24 (\"States entitled to take countermeasures\"). Only an injured State may engage in countermeasures, whether cyber in nature or not. Id.

Satellite Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nWhile no recorded case of kinetic attacks on satellites exist, satellites have often been exposed to electronic and cyberattacks. It is worth noting that, from an international law perspective, an argument can be made that a satellite is a quasi-extension of a state's territory because of the quasi-jurisdiction principle of Article VIII of the OST. Whether Article II OST would bar satellites as a quasi-extension of a state's territory falls beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is important to point out that Article II seems to only refer to land, and it likely emerged from a concern about preventing the \"colonization\" of outer space. This allows for the interpretation that the provision might not necessarily forbid considering a satellite as an extension of a state's territory. Even assuming the inability of states to claim satellites as extensions of their territory, this would not preclude the\n. See id.

In fact, the wrongful conduct does not need to occur in the territory of a state for a wrongful act to be found. The Tallinn Manual provides, for example, that a state can assert territorial jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure, individuals engaged in cyber activities within its borders, cyber activities originating from or concluding within its territory, and cyber activities that have a substantial effect within its borders. This provides more than classic territorial jurisdiction and likely covers cyberattacks on the Moon.\nAlthough the number of reported cases of satellite cyberattacks is limited, satellite cybersecurity is gaining increased attention.

These tactics are certainly unlawful, and, if attribution is possible, the affected state has the right to take countermeasures. Furthermore, if the tactic rises to the level of an “armed attack,” the situation could escalate to an international armed conflict. Spoofing, jamming, or dazzling affect satellites that are primarily used for national security or defense. Conversely, satellites with different applications, such as search and rescue satellites or civilian telecommunications, do not seem to face similar targeting. Consequently, the satellite’s function, and particularly its contribution to defense or national security, appears to be a key factor in determining its susceptibility to these non-kinetic interferences.\nAffected states have never officially attributed the attacks that they suffered to a specific state. In the absence of formally attributed attacks, there is no precedent or established examples to indicate the threshold at which these interferences would prompt a response from the affected state. It would not be correct to read the absence of a reaction as a recognition that these interferences are necessarily lawful. However, we could at least imply that states, at the moment, would seem to tolerate these minimal interferences with their military or quasi-military satellites. If this mindset carries over to lunar activities, there is a possibility that states might also accept these minor disruptions on the Moon. However, the approach might diverge concerning satellites not involved in military or quasi-military functions, potentially resulting in a different response to their attacks. Also, the unique lunar environment is characterized by its harsh conditions, where compromising even a single satellite could lead to catastrophic consequences. Such conditions could make it challenging to quickly\n179. Dana A. Goward, *Now Hear This - ‘Misnavigation’ or Spoofing?*, U.S. NAVAL INST.

The existence of an “armed attack” is essential for justifying the use of force in self-defense, making it an integral part of the ius ad bellum. Also, when an “armed conflict” occurs, it activates for the belligerents the application of the ius in bello.\nArticle 2.4 of the UN Charter provides that “[a]ll Members must abstain from the threat or use of force in their international relations against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This provision establishes the principle of non-aggression, rendering the use of force, threats of force, including acts of aggression and military interventions, illegal against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence. Notably, it also prohibits any use or threat of force that contradicts the United Nations’ purposes. Three instances exist where the prohibition of use of force within or against another state is lawful: (1) that state’s consent; (2) authorization from the UN Security Council; and (3) individual or collective self-defense.\nThis paper does not discuss the topic of states’ consent or the UN Security Council’s authorization; and it focuses on the right of self-defense, as specifically relevant to a reaction to a cyberattack on a satellite. Self-defense is a principle of customary international law, which is also recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter, which qualifies it as “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.” This right exists whether exercised individually or collectively by states (as under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty). Under the principle of self-defense, a state is allowed to employ force when confronted with an “armed attack.” Nevertheless, the pivotal issue lies in the definition of an “armed attack,” which ultimately determines the applicability of the right to self-defense.\nThe UN Charter does not provide a specific definition for the term “armed attack,” and records from the UN Charter’s drafters provide no definitive explanation of the term. Scholars suggest that the inexplicit definition of “armed attack” may exist because the concept was thought to be self-evident. The drafters and negotiators consistently viewed aggression as the catalyst for justifiable self-defense. They\n191. Blank, supra note 189, at 250.\n192. U.N. CHARTER, supra note 12.\n193.

Particularly important is the Nicaragua case, which adopts the “scale and effects” test to judge whether particular hostile actions directed at a state reach the level of an “armed attack.” The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) specified, for instance, that an event as minor as a “border incident” does not qualify as an “armed attack.” Along the same lines, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that “geographically limited clashes” in a “remote, unmarked, and disputed border” were not enough to be considered an “armed attack.” Likewise, “localized border encounters” involving “small infantry units,” even resulting “in loss of life” are not an “armed attack.” The Nicaragua case clarified that sending regular armed forces across a border or using irregular militias generally constitutes an armed attack. However, providing weapons to rebels across borders does not meet the threshold. The physical impact of an action—including evaluation of the territorial intrusion, casualties, or significant property damage—is a key consideration. Bombardments or kinetic attacks, only qualify as “armed attacks” if\n200.

However, in the Oil Platforms case, the court ruled that “the mining of a single military vessel could be sufficient to meet the definition of an ‘armed attack.’”\nAs discussed, at the United Nation San Francisco Conference of 1945, aggression was considered as the trigger for legitimate self-defense, specifically recognizing “armed attack” as a severe and separate form of aggression. For this reason, non-binding UN Resolution 3314 of the 1974 (“Definition of Aggression”) remains relevant for defining the term “armed attack.” Article I provides that “[a]ggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition.” Article II provides that “the First use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression” (unless the UN Security Council determines otherwise) while Article III goes on to list some examples of acts of aggression—like invasion, bombardment, blockade of ports, sending troops or mercenaries in another state, et cetera.\nThis paper will not delve any further on the general concept of “armed attack,” the previous discussion should adequately convey the complexity of this concept, which becomes even more challenging when applied to cyberattacks. Furthermore, imminence and immediacy are crucial; the right to use self-defense arises when an “armed attack” is ongoing or impending. The latter is commonly referred to as anticipatory self-defense (“Caroline Test”). Lastly, when evaluating\n206. Oil Platforms (Iran v.

APPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF “ARMED ATTACK” TO CYBERATTACKS\nIn modern conflicts, cyberattacks can disrupt critical information assets, communications, and weapons systems. Cyberattacks can also cause political disruption by targeting finance, energy, transportation, and government services, thus creating social unrest. In sum, a cyberattack can inflict damage well beyond that of a single bombardment. Can a cyberattack be classified as \"an armed attack\" under the UN Charter? Our discussion centers on cyberattacks existing independently of larger warfare contexts, such as the Ukrainian war. The focus is on singular or multiple cyberattacks that, devoid of any other military actions, could be perceived as acts of aggression against national security.\nThe possibility for a cyberattack to rise to the level of an \"armed attack\" relevant under the UN Charter is the object of some debate. This paper takes the position that a satellite cyberattack can constitute—in\nthe sinking of an American steamboat (Caroline) used by Canadian insurgents, on orders of the British, caused a famous exchange of letters between United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British representative Lord Ashburton. *Id.* That correspondence is referred to as establishing the elements of the customary international right of self-defense. Webster wrote to Ashburton: \"Under these circumstances, and under those immediately connected with the transaction itself, it will be for her majesty's government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of national law, the destruction of the 'Caroline' is to be defended. It will be for that government to show a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" *Id.*\n. This paper does not discuss another self-defense restriction: a state invoking self-defense, must quickly inform the UN Security Council. The Council, under Chapter VII, is chiefly responsible for authorizing force in situations jeopardizing global peace, making decisions to maintain or restore it, potentially endorsing force if needed.\n.

Cyber warfare involves cyberattacks targeting nations, causing potential harm to critical infrastructure and even loss of life. However, defining what qualifies as cyber warfare remains a subject of debate among cybersecurity experts, with some suggesting it includes attacks that can result in fatalities.

According to several scholars, cyberattacks can rise to the level of “armed attacks” as the UN Charter’s regulation regarding the use of force can be expanded to encompass cyberattacks conducted by one state against another through interpretative means. Several states share this position. For example, the United Kingdom asserted that, under specific circumstances, a cyberattack can be considered the equivalent of an “armed attack” triggering the right of self-defense. Ireland has adopted the “scale and effect” test, stating that use of force “may include instances where a cyber-operation does not cause physical damages such as where there is significant impairment of functionality of critical infrastructure.” “The circumstances under which non-injurious and non-destructive cyber operations might reach the use of force threshold remains a point of uncertainty among States.” However, only in “exceptional circumstances” could a cyber operation “reach this threshold.” France asserted that the threshold for the use of force in cyberspace is not solely determined by the digital tools employed, but by the impact of the cyber operation itself. If the effects of a cyber operation resemble those of traditional weaponry, it breaches the prohibition on using force between states. France acknowledges that even without physical consequences, a cyber operation could qualify as a use of force, in case of severe economic cyber impacts. France also declared the need to evaluate several criteria, including the operation’s origin, instigator’s nature, intrusion level, intended effects, and target, determines this assessment. Singapore proclaimed that the factors to consider are several, including the context during the cyber operation, its origin, the intended or actual impact, the level of intrusion, and the characteristics of the target. Singapore and Norway also recognized the possibility of severe economic cyber impacts being seen as an “armed attack.”\nBeyond general views expressed on the topic as discussed above, there are no official statements from states regarding specific instances of cyberattacks. Consequently, experts have sought to bridge this gap in state practice by offering their insights on how international law applies in this domain. Particularly authoritative in this debate is\n218.

Rule 69 provides that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.” Generally speaking, the suggested scale and effects test for assessing when a cyber operation rises to the level of a use of force under Article 2(4) UN Charter and customary international law is now widely accepted, including by the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”).\n## C. SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE\nSpace has not seen direct armed conflict yet, but, unfortunately, it may be only a matter of time. As the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report put it:\nWe know from history that every medium—air, land and sea—has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different. Given this virtual certainty, the U.S. must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space. This will require superior space capabilities.\nCurrently, “despite international efforts to stem . . . militarization, outer space is now seen by some as a viable theater of future warfare,\nnature of the connection, if any, between the cyber activity and the particular armed conflict in question”).

While it would seem generally accepted that, akin to physical conflicts, nations possess an inherent right to self-defense in the event of cyberattacks, the boundary of this right remains uncertain in international law, especially on whether the use of force is justified in response to a cyberattack.\n1. Rule 51 (Self-defence against armed attack) Application to Cyberattacks\nWhile Article 51 UN Charter broadly encompasses various forms of attacks, including cyberattacks, the Tallinn Manual appropriately clarifies that a state targeted by a cyberattack maintains the right to self-defense. Rule 71 (“Self-defence against armed attack”) provides: “A State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.” Some states have taken a stance on the right of self-defense in the case of cyberattacks. In 2018, the United Kingdom released the following statement: “It is clear that cyber operations that result in, or present an imminent threat of, death and destruction on an equivalent scale to an armed attack will give rise to an inherent right to take action in self-defence, as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The United Kingdom firmly believes that cyber operations leading to, or posing an immediate risk of, severe harm or destruction comparable to an “armed attack” warrant the inherent right to respond in self-defense, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. Canada also recognizes “that the inherent right of self-defence if an ‘armed attack’ occurs against a state also applies in cyberspace.”\n230.

Technical attribution is difficult because a cyberattack can be launched from anywhere and perpetrators are often able to conceal their identity, and equally difficult is the attribution to a particular country. However, because in an armed conflict “cyberattacks frequently accompany and facilitate conventional attacks, attribution is less problematic when an armed conflict is already undergoing.”\nThis paper discussed how self-defense requires imminence and immediacy, i.e. application of the Caroline Test. Self-defense in case of a cyberattack is no exception. Rule 73 (“Imminence and immediacy”) of the Tallinn Manual provides, “[t]he right to use force in self-defense arises if a cyber armed attack occurs or is imminent. It is further subject to a requirement of immediacy.” This paper also discussed how proportionality and necessity are also an issue in self-defense. Just as with a physical attack, the response of a targeted state to a cyberattack must align with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, the state is allowed only to take actions necessary to halt the attack or prevent additional ones. Rule 72 (“Necessity and proportionality”) of the Tallinn Manual provides “[a] use of force involving cyber operations undertaken by a State in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate.”\nAs the scope of a legitimate self-defense in cyberspace is debatable, afflicted countries are generally cautious when responding to cyberattacks due to the potential for escalation. Typically, diplomatic avenues are prioritized over immediate military or cyber counterattacks in retaliation. Lastly, as for physical attacks, collective self-defense (e.g., NATO) is also allowed.\n237. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67.\n238. See supra Part III(E)(1).\n239. See supra Part III(E)(1).\n240.

Ius in Bello and Its Application to Satellite Cyberattacks\nThe *ius in bello* governs the conduct of the hostilities, and has evolved over centuries. The *jus in bello* includes the laws of armed conflict (“LOAC”), alternatively known as international humanitarian law (“IHL”). This paper takes the position that IHL applies to conflicts in outer space, considering that the ICJ held that the IHL “applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future.” Consistent is the Tallinn Manual, which unambiguously provides that “[c]yber operations executed in the context of an armed conflict are subject to the law of armed conflict.” However, contrary opinions exist. There is limited discourse on applying IHL to satellites in lunar or other celestial bodies’ orbits, which is not surprising considering the early stage of the lunar economy and the presence of only a few satellites around the Moon. However, once the principle of IHL applying in outer space is accepted, there is no reason to restrict IHL application to Earth’s orbits.\nThis paper only briefly outlines IHL principles and examines their application in space, specifically focusing on satellites. The following discussion will briefly cover: (1) military necessity; (2) distinction; (3) proportionality; (4) precautions; (5) the principle of constant care; and (6) the principle of avoiding widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment. Military necessity mandates that any action in an international armed conflict must be justified as necessary to gain a clear military advantage. Distinction requires a clear differentiation between civilians and combatants, as well as civilian and military objectives with operations directed solely at military objects. Military objectives are those contributing to military action through their nature, location, purpose, or use, and when their (partial or total) destruction, capture, or neutralization provides a clear military advantage. Rule 93 of the Tallinn Manual clarifies that\n246. Frans G. von der Dunk, *Armed Conflicts in Outer Space: Which Law Applies?*, 97 INT’L L.

Scholars note that sometimes the purpose of a space object is unclear, and a civilian or commercial space object can be easily converted to military use by reprogramming it to handle military data. Regarding the \"definitive military advantage\" requirement, the challenge in space arises from the potential for shifting object locations, changing ownership, or altered circumstances that may render the destruction of a space object no longer providing a clear military advantage. Complications arise from the dual-use nature of many space objects, serving both military and civilian roles (like the GPS system). Dual-use objects are considered military targets under the principle of distinction. However,\n254. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 93 (\"Distinction\").\n255. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 99 (\"Prohibition of attacking civilian objects\"). Rule 100 (\"Civilian objects and military objectives\") distinguishes civilian objects from military objectives. Civilian objects encompass everything that is not a military objective.

Among the countries that utilized dual-use satellites is Russia. See generally Zak, supra note 175 (mentioning that the line between civilian and military use of most Russian orbital assets is often unclear). Applications like communications, navigation, remote sensing, and weather forecasting are crucial for both sectors. These assets can be considered dual-use since government-controlled entities use them for various purposes. Id. at 4. The same author, on the other hand, notes that \"Russia operates a fleet of communications satellites dedicated exclusively to the military\" Id. at 23.

This is consistent with the provision of the Tallinn Manual in point of cyber infrastructure. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 101 (\"Objects used for civilian and military purposes\"). \"Cyber infrastructure used for both civilian and military purposes is a military objective.\" Id. Rule 112 (\"Clearly separated and distinct military objectives\") is also significant, providing that \"[a] cyber attack that treats as a single target a number of clearly discrete cyber military objectives in cyber infrastructure primarily used for\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nevaluating whether those objects can be disrupted requires weighing other principles like proportionality, precautions, and ongoing care. Proportionality dictates that an attack should not result in excessive collateral damage to civilians or non-military objects, in relation to the expected, specific, and direct military advantage. The assessment necessitates weighing projected civilian losses against military gains, taking into account all available information.\nRule 113 of the Tallinn Manual dictates the prohibition to perform a “cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.” When a satellite is dual-use, proportionality is a significant concern because an attack on such a system could result in substantial civilian impact, making proportionality a potential barrier to attacking those objects. Precautions mandate attackers to exercise caution in their choice of attack methods, and presents a significant obstacle to targeting space objects, particularly due to the potential creation of space debris—a likely outcome if we are talking of kinetic attacks. Scholars suggest that a kinetic attack on a ground station might be the preferred method to achieve a clear military advantage while adhering to the principle of precautions. Rule 121 of the Tallinn Manual mandates the implementation of precautions as well.\nSatellite cyberattacks could be a viable option under the principle of precautions as it can blind satellites without generating debris. The principle of constant care (“requiring that constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians, and civilian objects”) requires evaluation of the impact on civilians, even when they are not in close proximity. This affects the proportionality balance. Rule 114 of the Tallinn Manual dictates that “during hostilities involving\ncivilian purposes is prohibited if to do so would harm protected persons or objects.” Id. at Rule 112 (“Clearly separated and distinct military objectives”).\n262.

Though not the main focus, IHRL factors like necessity, proportionality, precautions, and investigations are likely to impact decisions on satellite attacks, including cyberattacks. Applying IHRL to space raises concerns about potential violations of the right to life if individuals are killed through satellite targeting.\nIn conclusion, satellite cyberattacks generally adhere to most IHL principles, except potentially the principle of proportionality. The significant repercussions of destroying certain satellites, like the GPS system, may pose challenges due to their impact on the broader civilian population, potentially violating the principle of proportionality. When considering cyberattacks on lunar satellites, several critical factors come into play. The vast distance to the Moon necessitates autonomous operations, making immediate human intervention improbable.\n271. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 114 (“Constant Care”).\n272.

Id. at 628.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nAdditionally, the Moon presents harsh conditions, and any disruption to critical lunar satellites could result in catastrophic consequences. The implications of an attack on lunar satellites might not align with IHL principles, particularly concerning proportionality, as the magnitude of possible outcomes would far exceed acceptable limits, potentially causing indiscriminate harm. This raises concerns about the compatibility of such actions with the established framework of IHL. Furthermore, the growing lunar economy and increased human presence on the Moon will magnify the significance of IHRL concerns. As the utilization of lunar resources expands and human activities on the Moon increase, IHRL considerations are likely to emerge as pressing issues that need careful examination.\n## V. THE OUTER SPACE TREATY AND THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES VIS-À-VIS SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n## A. THE OST PROVISIONS RELEVANT FOR SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n### 1. Articles II, III, VIII, and IX of the OST\nThis paper examines now the regulations governing outer space, primarily outlined in the OST, which apply during both peacetime and wartime. Thus, it is a crucial consideration when addressing cyberthreats to satellites. However, this paper takes the position that the principles of *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* are “the *lex specialis* during armed conflict and prevail over the general law of outer space.” Several provisions potentially impact the issue of cyberattacks on lunar satellites. First, Article II of the OST, which likely aimed at preventing the “colonization” of outer space, and which specifies, “[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.” The prevailing view asserts that this non-appropriation principle applies to both States and private\n. See, e.g., *id.* at 649 (citing to Michael N. Schmitt, *International law and military operations in space*, 10 Max Planck Y.B. U.N. L. 89 (2006); Dale Stephens &amp; Cassandra Steer, *Conflicts in space international humanitarian law and its application to space warfare*, 40 Annals Air &amp; Space L. 71 (2015); Macak, *Silent War*, supra note 250.).\n.

See Eller, supra note 167.\n. OST, supra note 17, at Art. II.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nSecond, Article III of the OST, which mandates that states conduct activities in line with international law—including the UN Charter—and aims to uphold international peace, security, cooperation, and understanding. As a result of this provision, the use of force and its threat are forbidden under Article 2.4 of the UN Charter, except as permitted by Article 51 (pertaining to self-defense) and decisions of the UN Security Council.\nThird, Article VIII OST, which stipulates that a state retains jurisdiction and control over an object launched into outer space under its registry. This registration implies authority over the registered object. Consequently, a satellite circling the Moon falls under the jurisdiction of the state that officially registered it. This provision establishes a form of jurisdiction similar to the concept of a “flag” state, resembling territorial control over the registered space object\n282. See, e.g., Ricky J. Lee, Article II of the Outer Space Treaty: Prohibition of State Sovereignty, Private Property Rights, or Both, 11 AUSTL. INT’L L.J. 128, 129 (2004) (highlighting how the prohibition must include private entities: because per Article VI, “any act of national appropriation by private entities would be subject to the direction or influence of the State”).\n283. See, e.g., Stephen Gorove, Interpreting Article II of the Outer Space Treaty, 37 FORDHAM L. REV. 349 (1969).

III.\n287. COLOGNE COMMENTARY ON SPACE LAW: Vol. I 65 (Stephan Hobe et al., eds., Carl Heymanns Verlag 2009) [hereinafter COLOGNE COMMENTARY I].\nA major imperative for declaring international law, including the UN charter, applicable to outer space, was the overriding concern for the maintenance of international peace and security, which, after all, is the primary purpose and responsibility of the United Nations (UN) and the fear for an arms race in outer space. Thus, generally accepted rules and principles, such as the prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defense, would also be in force in outer space. Id. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n288. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n289.

SPACE L. 323, 328 (2014).\nThe registry of a space object has the same legal consequences as registering a ship or an aircraft. The only difference is that in Space Law, inclusion in the national registry does not confer nationality de jure to the spacecraft, only jurisdiction and control thereon. However, in practice such inclusion entitles the State of registry to exercise its sovereignty over the registered object. This amounts to a quasi-nationality or nationality de facto of the space object.\nId.\n290. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nakin to an airplane flagged with a particular state. Notably, Article VIII applies solely to “launched” objects, excluding items constructed in space. Therefore, it will not be applicable to satellites constructed directly in lunar orbits.\nFourth, Article IX: this paper will only briefly mention the principle of due regard. “In the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty . . . shall conduct all their activities in outer space . . . with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty.” Due regard, akin to a primary “duty of care,” stands as a potential mechanism for international responsibility regarding wrongful acts. For example, if State A (or one of its nationals) conducts a cyberattack on a lunar satellites of State B (or one of its nationals), State A would not show proper consideration for the activity of State B. This would violate the obligation of due regard, activating the secondary rule of responsibility previously addressed. The exact scope of due regard remains unclear as this provision has never been used, resulting in a dearth of established State practices. In practice, State parties seem hesitant or unwilling to directly acknowledge the concept of “due regard.”\n## 2. Article IV(1) of the OST\nThe only substantive provision of the OST dealing with military use is Article IV, which (1) prohibits placing in orbit/installing/stationing (as opposed to transiting) nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction in space; (2) requires using the Moon and other celestial bodies (but not empty space) “exclusively for peaceful purposes”; and\n291. Id.\n292. OST, supra note 17, at Art. IX. Among other deliberate omissions, this paper does not discuss the harmful interference principal also established by Article IX OST. The harmful interference principle provides that States can engage in international consultations if their space-related activities foreseeably interfere with other nations’ endeavors. Similarly, a State can request consultations if it believes another country’s space actions might disrupt peaceful space exploration. While this clause has potential relevance for lunar satellites, this paper does not discuss it because, for the way in which Article IX is framed, the provision would seem to refer to involuntary interference and not a cyberattack.\n293.

See supra Part III(A).\n296. Listner, The Paradox of Article IX, supra note 294, at 28 (discussing States’ reluctance to resort to Article IX OST).\n297. Member states have interpreted “peaceful” as “non-aggressive” not as “nonmilitary.” See, e.g., Fabio Tronchetti, *Legal aspects of the military uses of outer space*, in *HANDBOOK OF SPACE LAW* (Frans von der Dunk, ed., Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015), at 331–81.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nWhile more specific than other provisions of the OST, Article IV uses general language and lacks crucial definitions, especially as it pertains to terms such as \"weapons of mass destructions,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"military.\"298 Article IV(1) establishes a ban on certain types of weapons in space (\"nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\"), which cannot be placed \"in orbit around the earth,\" installed \"on celestial bodies,\" \"or stationed in outer space in any other manner.\"299 It does not impose restrictions on non-weapons of mass destruction.300\nArticle IV(1) of the OST has no bearing on the capacity to protect lunar satellites against cyberattacks. In fact, neither nuclear weapons nor weapons of mass destruction are requisite for deterring cyberattacks on lunar satellites. Not only are these weapons unnecessary, but they would also run counter to the principle of proportionality, which governs both the employment of countermeasures for international wrongful acts and the lawful response to \"armed attacks\" in self-defense.\n## 3. Article IV(2) of the OST\nArticle IV(2) of the OST provides that \"the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes\" and bans \"[t]he establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies.\" It provides two exceptions to this overarching prohibition: (1) \"[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,\" and (2) \"[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.\"\nArticle IV(2) of the OST could potentially impact the capacity for deterrence and defense against cyberattacks if it were deemed applicable to orbital regions—a stance this paper does not support—as elucidated below. Before delving into the rationale for this position, let us assess the implications of Article IV(2) of the OST within the specific\n298. COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 71 (arguing that the article lacks definitions that could clarify terms such as \"military uses of space weapon\" and \"peaceful uses,\" preventing a clear differentiation between \"peaceful\" and \"exclusively peaceful\").\n299. OST, supra note 17, at Art. IV(1).\n300. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OFF. GEN.

In providing that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used . . . exclusively for peaceful purposes,” the provision would seem to exclude the possibility to militarily defend the assets. Even assuming that this provision does indeed pertain to orbital regions, this provision should not be construed as limiting the right of self-defense. First, the right of self-defense is a well-established norm of customary international law, solidified in Article 51 UN Charter. Its significance and authority are unlikely to be susceptible to influence by a provision framed in such broadly general terms as Article IV(2). Therefore, the right of self-defense must exist in outer space (contrary views exist). Second, in case of an armed conflict, ius ad bellum and ius in bello are lex specialix that prevail the OST. Article 103 of the UN Charter provides that in cases where members of the United Nations have conflicting obligations under the current Charter and other international agreements, the obligations under the UN Charter shall prevail. Third, the term “peaceful” under Article IV(2) should be interpreted as “non-aggressive” and not “as non-military.” The term “peaceful” also appears in the Preamble, Article IX, and Article XI. However, it is only in Article IV(2) that the term “peaceful” is paired with “exclusively,” creating a distinct regulatory emphasis on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Some scholars have pointed out that this is significant to give a special regime to the Moon and other celestial bodies, no matter how the term “peaceful” is interpreted within the OST, the crucial point lies in how Article IV(2) combines it with the term “exclusively.”\n301. This contrary view states that self-defense on celestial bodies is limited by Article IV OST. See, e.g., Arjen Vermeer, The Laws of War in Outer Space: Some Legal Implications for the Jus ad Bellum and the Jus in Bello of the Militarisation and Weaponisation of Outer Space, in THE NEW ORDER OF WAR (2010) at 6 (arguing that “Article IV OST precludes offensive and defensive military activity on celestial bodies”). See also Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 354 (citing authorities that question the applicability of the right of self-defense in outer space).\n302. While Article 103 talks of “obligations” and not “rights” under the convention, because Article 51 is complementary to Article 2.4 (ban on use of force and threat thereof), Article 103 should be read as to make Article 51 prevail over inconsistent provisions, too. Different interpretations are possible.\n303. See, e.g., Matthew G. Looper, International Space Law: How Russia and the U.S. are at Odds in the Final Frontier, 18 S.C. J. INT’L.

In essence, the moon and other celestial bodies are intended to remain devoid of any military utilization. Id. See also, Marko G.

Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War is commonly cited as the inaugural \"space war\" because of the extensive utilization of space-based capabilities throughout the conflict.

However, if that were the case, the two explicitly stated exceptions to this provision would come into play. As mentioned, these exceptions are as follows: (1) “[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,” and (2) “[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.” Either of these exceptions provides ample flexibility to permit deterrence and protection of lunar satellites. In fact, the satellites slated for deployment around the Moon, at least initially, will serve “scientific research or other peaceful purposes,” such as experiments and enabling lunar mining. An argument can be constructed, therefore, that the deployment of “military personnel” essential for deterring and defending these satellites should fall under this exception. Additionally, under the second exception, the use of any equipment or facility necessary for deterring attacks on and safeguarding these satellites should also be permissible, even if generally prohibited by the overarching provision of the latter part of Article IV(2) because at least initially the lunar satellites will be “necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon.”\nFurthermore, this paper argues that Article IV(2) exclusively applies to the Moon and celestial bodies themselves and does not encompass lunar orbits (as well as the orbits of other planets).[310] Lunar orbits and similar regions can be arguably considered part of empty outer space, exclusively covered by Article IV(1). Consequently, if the need for military defense against cyberattacks on lunar satellites were to arise, it would be legal to station military personnel and equipment in the vicinity of the Moon or lunar orbit (as opposed to the lunar surface). There are several reasons why Article IV(2) does not extend to these orbits. First, the general principle is that Article I of the OST's freedom of use applies to \"empty outer space,\"[311] while the regulation of celestial bodies is the exception. Given that Article IV(2) contains an exception to a general principle, it should be narrowly construed. Second, at least some orbits (i.e., Earth's orbit) have been used \"militarily\" since the inception of the space age, and no state has significantly objected to that use.[312] Therefore, state practice supports the argument that orbits are empty outer space and are not covered by Article IV(2). According to Article 31.3(b) of the Vienna Convention on\n310. See, e.g., COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 81–82 (making the argument that outer space is not covered by Article IV(2)).\n311.

Different opinions exist. See, e.g., Michael Listner, The Moon Treaty: failed international law or waiting in the shadows?, THE SPACE REV. (Oct. 24, 2011), https://www.thespacereview.com/article/1954/1 [hereinafter Listner, The Moon Treaty] (\"arguing that although only a few nations ratified the Moon Treaty, the participation of countries like Australia, France, and India as signatories create \"a shadow of customary law which could grow\" so that non-parties may be influenced by the Moon Treaty's shadow if they do not challenge its legitimacy\").\n315. Article 3 of the Moon Agreement provides:\n1. The moon shall be used by all States Parties exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n2. Any threat or use of force or any other hostile act or threat of hostile act on the moon is prohibited. It is likewise prohibited to use the moon in order to commit any such act or to engage in any such threat in relation to the earth, the moon, spacecraft, the personnel of spacecraft or man-made space objects.\n3. States Parties shall not place in orbit around or other trajectory to or around the moon objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction or place or use such weapons on or in the moon.\n4. The establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military maneuvers on the moon shall be forbidden. The use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited. The use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration and use of the moon shall also not be prohibited.\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nnecessity of using lunar orbit for lunar activities may seem logical. However, this argument is less compelling compared to the opposing view supported by the reasons mentioned earlier.\n## B. THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE ARRANGEMENTS\n### 1. The Other Space Treaties\nAfter the OST was enacted in 1967, several other significant treaties were signed between 1968 and 1976. These treaties, namely the Rescue Agreement, Liability Convention, and Registration Convention, also pertain to Moon activities and Moon satellites. None of these treaties are highly pertinent to the subject of this paper, except for the Liability Convention, which could be relevant if a cyber-attack results in measurable damage for which the victim-state seeks compensation.\nIn 1979—the Moon Agreement was signed—and it could have had the potential to significantly influence the subject of this paper. However, this treaty ultimately failed due to the limited number of ratifications. Therefore, while differing opinions exist, this paper contends that the dismissal of the Moon Agreement by the vast majority of states (including all major space-faring nations except India and Australia) renders it largely irrelevant for our analysis. However, as previously discussed, it can still serve a purpose when employed in a contrasting manner to enhance our understanding of the interpretation of OST. In other words, if the Moon Agreement found it necessary to address a particular issue, it implies that the OST does not cover that aspect.\n### 2.

Section 5 (“Interoperability”) provides that the Signatories acknowledge that the use of compatible and shared exploration infrastructure and standards (including standard for communication systems) advances exploration, scientific research, and commercial utilization. Therefore the Signatories commit to strive to employ existing interoperability standards, or to create new standards when current ones are absent or insufficient. Interoperability enhances cybersecurity and therefore, by providing this commitment, the Artemis Accords significantly increase protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks. Section 11 (“Deconfliction of Space Activities”), and in particular, Sections 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 are relevant. First, in Section 11.1, the Signatories reconfirm their commitment to the OST with alignment on provisions such as due regard and prevention of harmful interference. Second, in Section 11.3 the Signatories reaffirm the commitment to use due regard, as per Article IX of the OST. Section 11.3 also provides that if a Signatory fears or has suffered harmful interference, that Signatory can initiate a consultation with the other Signatory that authorized the activity (or any party to the OST). Lastly, Section 11.4 commits the Signatories to avoid deliberate actions that could lead to harmful interference with each other’s utilization of outer space. The impact of the above principles on cybersecurity for lunar satellites is undeniable.\ncooperation%20on%20Artemis %20is,of%20the%20 Outer%20Space%20Treaty (last visited Oct 28, 2023).\n.

DEFENDING MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITES\n## A. UNITED STATES' SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY AND DEFENSE\nWhile the attitude of the U.S. towards space exploration and use is peaceful, the United States has repeatedly reaffirmed its right to take countermeasures, its right of self-defense, and its intention to use these rights in case its space activities are threatened. For years, the U.S. has recognized the vulnerability of space objects to both physical attacks and cyberattacks. Already in 2001, the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report pointed out that “with the growing commercial and national security use of space, U.S. assets in space and on the ground offer just such targets. The U.S. is an attractive candidate for a ‘Space Pearl Harbor.’” The concept of space as a domain at risk is repeated in many documents of military doctrine:\n[I]n the contested, congested, and competitive space warfighting domain, our potential adversaries continue to develop, test, and proliferate sophisticated weapons. These weapons have the potential to be the most severe risks to orbital flight. To minimize this risk, it is imperative we execute threat-focused space operations that are fully integrated with timely and relevant intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.\nPresident Obama’s National Space Policy (“2010 NSP”) emphasizes the safeguarding of space assets mentioning the following necessities: (1) to ensure cost-effective resilience of space capabilities based on their planned use, potential consequences of capability loss, threat levels, and the availability of alternative means to fulfill missions; and (2) to develop and employ strategies and capabilities for the safeguard of critical national security space-dependent missions, including rapid asset restoration and leveraging diverse resources for mission execution. The 2010 NSP suggests proliferation of space capabilities as\n. 51 U.S.C. § 20102 (“Congressional declaration of policy and purpose”) provides that “Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.” *Id.*\n.

If deterrence fails, the right to self-defense is invoked in accordance with international law and treaty obligations.[334] The 2011 NSSS specified that, although the U.S. believes that all space-faring nations should strive to prevent space hostilities, it acknowledges that some actors might still see military advantage in space-based actions.[335] In 2018, the Trump Administration issued the U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy,[336] and instituted the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency.[337] Specifically on cybersecurity for space, the Trump Administration issued Space Policy Directive 5 - Cybersecurity Principles for Space System (\"SPD-5\"), which focused on cybersecurity for space systems and urged federal agencies and non-governmental space operators to establish cybersecurity norms.[338]\nIn 2020, the National Space Policy (\"2020 NSP\")[339] reaffirmed the right of self-defense providing that if any adversary jeopardizes the advantages that the U.S. gains from space, the U.S. will use all means to deter and, if needed, overcome hostile actions in space. The U.S. will continue to use space for national security, including the right of self-defense, as unfettered access and operational freedom in space\n333.

The 2020 NSP specifies that the U.S. regards intentional interference with space systems (including their support and infrastructure) as a violation of its national rights.\nThe focus of the 2020 NSP is on deterring and countering threats to the U.S. and their allies' space interests; it clarified that any attack on, or intentional interference with, these interests will be met with a calculated response at a time, place, and manner according to U.S. discretion. A cyberattack of a satellite is obviously an attack/intentional interference with a space system and will therefore be considered an infringement of the U.S.' rights. The U.S. will seek to deter that threat, but if unsuccessful will respond appropriately, and not necessarily in kind.\nThe 2020 NSP emphasizes the U.S.' intention of developing plans and capabilities to counter any interference or attack on U.S. or allied space systems, especially those vital for critical infrastructure, enabling a responsive approach as determined by the U.S. The 2020 NSP highlights that the U.S. aims for a secure, stable, and open space environment. It also recognizes that the space domain has evolved into a \"warfighting domain\" due to the actions of competitors. Noting the critical importance of space security for both U.S. and global stability, the 2020 NSP outlines the need for the U.S. to enhance its security systems, policies, and strategies to safeguard its space interests, dictating specific principles. The 2020 NSP designates Space Force as the main military branch for space, with the responsibility to organize, train, and equip forces to protect national interests in space and ensure access to space. Space Force will also supply forces for offensive, defensive, and support operations to U.S. Space Command and other commands. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with protecting the use of space for U.S. national security, economic interests, and those of allies and partners.

Recognizing that the convergence of the digital and physical realms poses a risk to national systems, the 2023 NCSS establishes three key principles:\n(1) obtaining global recognition that international law is applicable in cyberspace in times of peace or war; (2) obtaining consensus on norms of responsible behavior; and (3) promoting trust-building measures for inter-state cooperation. With specific reference to space, the 2023 NCSS notes how reliance on space assets is increasing cyberrisks, and the transition of numerous critical systems to digital platforms is exacerbating the potential damage from cyberattacks.\nThe 2023 NCSS also points out the increasing reliance of the government on the commercial sectors for national security needs.

For the purpose of this paper, Pillar Two is the most important because it: (1) outlines the U.S. strategy to employ all available means (including diplomacy, information, finance, intelligence, and law enforcement) to deter potential attackers from jeopardizing U.S. interests, and to halt malicious actors from conducting extended cyber-campaigns that are a threat to national security and public safety;[356] (2) expresses the U.S.' intention to execute continuous and precisely targeted \"disruption campaigns\" to dissuade cybercriminals from engaging in cyber-activities (including by making those activities unprofitable);[357] (3) promotes the private sector's collaboration via nonprofit organizations as central hubs for cooperation with the Government;[358] (4) highlights the Government's commitment to disrupt ransomware activities by rendering them unprofitable.[359] Pillar Three[360] deals with shaping market forces to drive security and resilience, (including insurance program),[361] while Pillar Four focuses on investments and incentives.[362]\nImplementation actions are necessary. In 2023 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") issued Introduction to Cybersecurity for Commercial Satellite Operations,[363] a document setting non-binding standards which lack specificity.

However, with the growth of the lunar economy, a more concentrated emphasis on the Moon is advised.\n## B. NATO’s POSITION\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), established in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty, is a political and military alliance created as a collective defense organization among North American and European countries, totaling thirty-two members. Collective defense is NATO’s bedrock: NATO members pledge to consider an attack against any of its members as an attack against all, triggering a duty to respond collectively. Equally significant is the aspect of defense planning, meaning that the members collaborate on planning their defense and developing military capabilities against security challenges. Also crucial is the aspect of cooperative security, which means that NATO cooperates with non-member countries and international organizations to promote security and stability, such as conventional military threats, terrorism, and hybrid warfare, and cyberattacks.\nTo comprehend NATO’s stance on cyberattacks targeting satellites, it is essential to recognize that the matter resides at the intersection of NATO’s position on satellite defense and its response to cyberattacks. NATO has been increasingly focused on protecting and defending its members’ satellites, considering that satellites are crucial to communication, navigation, reconnaissance, and military operations. In 2019, NATO officially recognized space as an operational domain “alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace.”\n---\n.

Both satellites and ground-based facilities are potential targets for these threats.371 NATO's goal is not to become an independent space player,372 but to enhance and contribute to the efforts of its member states and collaborate with other pertinent international organizations.373 This includes enhancing space domain awareness374 in cooperation with space agencies and advancing counter-space capabilities and technologies for safeguarding space assets, including cybersecurity defense.\nNATO has reaffirmed its long-standing belief that cyberspace is continuously contested by various state and non-state actors.375 Most notably, NATO's robust engagement in cyber defense and the role of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (\"CCDCOE\") are evidenced by the Tallinn Manual.376 An important example of NATO's approach regarding a specific cyberattack exists. In 2007, Estonia endured a massive cyberattack from Russia, which was likely provoked by the controversial relocation of a Red Army statue to a cemetery. The cyberattacks persisted for weeks, impacting banks, media\ncommunications%2C%20navigation%20%20and%20intelligence (last visited Mar. 16, 2024).\n369. NATO's overarching space policy, N. ATL.

TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIt is challenging to predict what NATO would do in case of a cyberattack on the Moon because it is a vastly different environment compared to Earth, and the impact of a cyberattack on a satellite or group of satellites may vary significantly. Also, on the Moon a cyberattack could be more impactful (due to the scarcity of satellites) or less impactful (due to the limited number of people affected). However, one could make a reasonable argument that if NATO did not view the extensive 2007 cyberattack in Estonia as meeting the criteria for a cyberattack requiring collective self-defense, it would be even more unlikely for NATO to categorize an attack on a lunar satellite in that way.\n## C. OTHER SPACEFARING COUNTRIES VIS-À-VIS LUNAR SATELLITES\n### 1. China\nChina’s progress in space technologies, initially non-military in nature, carries significant military implications because of their dual-use potential. This duality is evident in Chinese space missions like lunar exploration, where technologies developed for these purposes—such as robotics, radar networks, and materials—have the potential for military adaptation. While China may not explicitly articulate military intentions for space in their policies or directives, and consistently advocates for the use of outer space only for “peaceful purposes.”\n. Damien McGuinness, *How a cyber attack transformed Estonia*, BBC NEWS (Apr. 17, 2017), https://www.bbc.com/news/39655415.\n. *China’s White Papers on Space*, supra note 33, at 8. The Chinese White Papers “are silent on China’s policies about Space-based and/or Earth-based weapons for targets in Space. . . . There is no mention of investments in technologies like jamming technology.” *Id.* The truth, however, is that “[t]he emphasis in the White Papers is on the civilian aspects of the Chinese Space programme.” *Id.* at 9.\n. *China’s Space Program: A 2021 Perspective*, THE STATE COUNCIL INFO. OFF. OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (Jan. 28, 2022), www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465645/n6465648/c6813088/content.html (“2021 White Paper”). In section I, subsection 3, China reaffirmed to have “always advocated the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes any attempt to turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield or launch an arms race in outer space.” *Id.* The 2021 White Paper does not address military activities in space and only briefly references the defense of national security.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nChina's practice has suggested otherwise. China has indeed employed space for military objectives, and the military plays a crucial role in the Chinese space program. BeiDou—China's GNSS system—serves as a prime example, demonstrating China's strategic utilization of dual-use technology to bolster its geopolitical influence. Evidence of China's military focus in space includes the recent establishment of the Information Support Force (“ISF”), a military branch aimed at providing strategic support for network information systems under the Central Military Commission’s control to strengthen military capabilities through informatization and intelligence. This reorganization also involved dismantling the Strategic Support Force (“SSF”) and creating the Aerospace Force (“AF”) and Cyberspace Force (“CF”).\nEvidence suggests that China regularly utilizes jamming and spoofing methods on GPS satellites to safeguard sensitive areas from drone surveillance or potential attacks. Additionally, there are reports of China targeting U.S. government satellites on a daily basis. If China gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable China might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well. China has also developed ground-based laser systems designed to dazzle the optical sensors of spy satellites as they pass over sensitive sites to temporarily prevent the satellite from taking a picture or physically damage the image sensor.\n380. See China’s White Papers on Space, supra note 33 at 4 (showing that China’s space program is propelled by multifaceted objectives: advancing space exploration for Earth and beyond, fostering global agreement on peaceful space use and security, meeting economic, scientific, technological, and national security needs, showcasing Chinese scientific and cultural achievements, safeguarding national rights and interests, and bolstering the nation’s overall capabilities).\n381.

Russia\nNotwithstanding numerous declarations to the effect that space must be reserved for peaceful purposes, evidence exists that Russia continues in the militarization of space. Russian space law—largely governed by Federal Law No. 5663—stipulates that space activities must adhere to legal provisions for safeguarding state secrets, military and commercial secrets, intellectual property, and exclusive rights. This suggests that the federal law acknowledges Russia's intention to utilize space for military purposes. Despite some progress in national security space capabilities, the Russian space industry is currently grappling with an era of stagnation.\nLately, Russia has heightened its efforts in developing antisatellite systems, with some of these efforts being publicly disclosed. Additionally, Russia has been engaged in the creation of orbital maneuvering satellites, potentially for tasks related to inspection and interception. The advancement in these technologies not only hints at Russia's intention to target reconnaissance and communication satellites, but also signifies a growing unease within Russia regarding the perceived weaponization of space by others. Given Russia's long history of imperialism, reasonable doubts exist that its advocacy for peace in space might stem more from its current limited space capabilities, rather than from a genuine desire for space to remain a sanctuary. There is evidence suggesting Russia regularly uses jamming and\n386. See supra Part II(A).\n387.

If Russia gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable they might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well.\n## VII. CONCLUSION\nThis paper has delved into the issue of cyber-threats for satellites in non-Earth orbits, particularly in lunar orbits, amid escalating cyber-risks. The growing cislunar and lunar economy will heighten vulnerability, especially for commercial lunar satellites lacking robust protection. Just as Earth-orbiting satellites have faced increasing threats, lunar satellites will be confronted with similar risks in the expanding lunar economy. With a limited number of satellites orbiting the Moon, this paper has drawn insights from threats facing Earth's satellites to anticipate risks for lunar counterparts, focusing specifically on cyberthreats. Cyberthreats pose unique challenges due to attribution complexities and scope of the right of self-defense. This paper has examined cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and as armed attacks, assessing affected states' rights to self-defense. Considering provisions in the UN Charter and the OST, this paper has concluded that Article IV of the OST cannot be interpreted as impeding the right of self-defense of lunar satellites. Even if certain restrictions exist, this paper has argued that the right of self-defense would prevail when constrained by these limitations. Preserving security for both government and commercial satellites remains crucial for U.S. national interests, and it will become paramount on the Moon as well. The recognition that the right of self-defense is not diminished in space is an important component of satellite security.\n. Dong L.

WHY SATELLITES ARE PARTICULARLY EASY TARGETS FOR CYBERATTACKS A satellite could be attacked kinetically or non-kinetically. “Kinetic” means actions involving physical force or direct contact, such as bombings and other types of attacks that cause physical damage, while “non-kinetic” attacks are those that do not involve a direct physical force. A cyberattack—the focus of this paper—is a form of non-kinetic attack being carried out by digital means to compromise, disrupt, or damage data, infrastructure, or communication. The term “cyberattack” has several definitions, including the following: “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident or transiting these systems or networks.” Cyberattacks are performed through malware, hacking, denial-of-service, and other tactics aimed at compromising or disrupting computer systems, networks, and data. A cyberattack can aim at stealing sensitive information, or causing system malfunctions, or blocking the system (unblocking it only after the payment of a sum of money called ransomware). Cyberattacks are not the only possible form of non-kinetic attacks.

Satellites are prone to both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks because of their inherent characteristics. Scholars Georgeson and Stubbs explain that satellites are vulnerable due to several factors: (1) they are typically unshielded; (2) they follow predictable orbits, (3) they have limited maneuverability, (4) they are \"few enough in number\" that their destruction could have substantial repercussions; (5) replacing them is costly and consuming; and (6) numerous satellites have dual-use functionality, providing services to the military and to civilians, making them potential targets for enemy attacks.80 Not all of the factors mentioned above are equally relevant to protection against cyberattacks. As for shielding:81 while shielding against destructive attacks like kinetic anti-satellite missiles is difficult, protection against non-kinetic attacks is feasible (e.g., to safeguard against electronic attacks, a shutter shield could protect specific sensors or satellite lids; shielding could be effective against blinding lasers or dazzlers). Shielding satellites against kinetic attacks is not only challenging but also costly, as it increases expenses not only during",

CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] development but also during launch due to the added weight.82 Dissimilarly, protection against cyberattacks does not necessitate an increase in weight, and therefore launch costs. While development expenses are still a consideration, it is crucial for all satellite operators to create a robust cybersecurity system. As for predictability of orbit and fuel scarcity: satellites follow predictable orbits,83 not only due to the laws of physics, but also because they carry limited fuel—which restricts their ability to make significant changes to their orbits. Additionally,84 technical limitations on maneuverability and fuel scarcity result in satellite operators being unable to make rapid maneuvers, even if they detect that an attack is coming.85 Cyberattacks would not be affected by predictability of orbit or limited maneuverability because cyberattacks happen in the \"cyberworld,\" where maneuverability is not necessary; only a robust cybersecurity program is essential. In terms of the limited number (i.e., lack of redundancy of satellites), the landscape is swiftly evolving.86 While satellites remain relatively scarce, LEO constellations are significantly altering this scenario in many instances, making lack of redundancy somewhat less impactful. However, this is not universally applicable to every satellite type or operator. In certain instances, operators might not possess hundreds or thousands of satellites performing the same functions; they might have only a few, which play a pivotal role in providing crucial services.87 All things considered, satellites are still relatively few in number.88",

Stating: 2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES 677 Satellites often lack security components;[89] Koplow contends that many satellites do not possess onboard sensors for local situational awareness, potentially leaving them unaware of any attacks or their sources.[90] Constellations influence the replacement factor by maintaining a continuous turnover of satellites. Yet, certain operators cannot bear the expenses of development or replacement in the event of satellite destruction.[91] Replacement is not a factor for cyberattack because the damage is generally reversible. If a satellite faces temporary impairment, its functionality could be restored provided the system is properly designed. In addition to the above factors, there are factors specific to cyberattacks, such as a lack of system redundancies, the remote nature of satellite operations, and limited or outdated computer resources. Some of the satellites lack system redundancy. System redundancy involves incorporating supplementary components, resources, or elements within a satellite that are not strictly essential for its operation but are included to improve reliability, availability, fault tolerance, and overall robustness.[92] Although redundant systems can still be susceptible to cyberattacks,[93] redundancy could mitigate the risk because, if a component is compromised due to a cyberattack, other components might be capable of fulfilling its functions. Today satellites—at least the larger ones—are designed with redundancy in mind.[94] [Satellites] are still relatively few in number (so destroying or damaging even a handful could have a major impact); they are \"soft\" (lacking heavy shielding or the ability to defend themselves from attack); they usually follow known, predictable orbital paths, with little ability to undertake evasive maneuvers (so they are easily trackable \"sitting ducks\").

CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] Regarding the remote nature of operations, space systems are particularly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats due to the remote nature of their operations. Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks;[95] if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands.[96] Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.[97] As for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging.[98] Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.[99] ## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY Satellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation.[100] Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations.[101] In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite. Considering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly.",

Lunar satellites present an opportunity to implement necessary protective measures on an open canvas. ## D. THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF LUNAR SATELLITES This paper has discussed how, as the lunar economy grows, dependable navigation and communication will be crucial for both government and private lunar missions. Currently, lunar orbits remain relatively uncrowded.¹⁰⁵ However, some satellites and orbiters from previous lunar missions are still orbiting the Moon. As of July 2023, there were at least six “active lunar orbiters:”¹⁰⁶ Artemis P1 and Artemis P2 (operating “in eccentric orbits of low inclination”); NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (orbiting “the Moon in a nearly polar, slightly elliptical orbit”); Chandrayaan-2 of the Indian Space Agency and Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (both operating in “in polar orbits of 100 km altitude”); and NASA’s Capstone (having a completely different, and much higher orbit).¹⁰⁷ Additionally, two non-operative spacecrafts (the 2009 Japanese Ouna and the Indian 2008 Chandrayaan-1) currently ¹⁰².

CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] orbit the Moon.¹⁰⁸ Lunar satellites will face geophysical threats coming from the Moon's environment.¹⁰⁹ The main concern is that the Moon is not nearby enough to quickly address these issues. Therefore, planned lunar missions must be sustainable and autonomous. In regards to cybersecurity, when planning lunar missions, scientists and engineers must use various models to approximate real conditions—such as thermal environments, difficulties in communications and navigation systems, placement and maneuvering of the spacecraft, as well as generation and storage of the power. However, uncertainties, unknowns, or unforeseen circumstances on the Moon may pose hazards for lunar missions.¹¹⁰ No documented cyberthreats have targeted satellites in lunar orbits, but security breaches in space agencies have sparked worries about mission safety. NASA frequently discloses cybersecurity issues, such as unauthorized attempts to access its systems. In 2019, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported a data breach resulting from unauthorized access.¹¹¹ Though these incidents might not have caused visible harm, NASA and other government entities and organizations must always focus on safeguarding their digital assets and infrastructure. Recognizing the critical role of lunar satellites, the 2022 National Cislunar Science &amp; Technology Strategy (\"NCS&amp;T Strategy\"),¹¹² in outlining its key objectives, provided for the need to \"implement Cislunar communications and PNT capabilities with scalable and interoperable approaches\"¹¹³ and for the extension of \"space situational awareness capabilities into Cislunar space.\"¹¹⁴ The NCS&amp;T Strategy contains two specific mentions of cybersecurity, clarifying that cybersecurity is ¹⁰⁸.

For example, as addressed above, the predictability of orbits increases the propensity to attacks but; predictability of orbit is not to be considered a problem for cislunar satellites. These satellites have the opposite problem; satellite orbits tend to shift continuously¹¹⁷ unless they are positioned in proximity of Lagrange points L4 and L5.¹¹⁸ As the lunar economy advances, both government and commercial satellite operators must remain vigilant in safeguarding their assets, even if they perceive cyber-risks as unlikely. This perception of unlikelihood could pose a particular challenge for commercial actors.¹¹⁹ Conversely, governments have been concerned about cybersecurity threats since the inception of the space program.¹²⁰ The government should be proactive in safeguarding commercial systems in a space protection plan because threats to commercial actors’ lunar ¹¹⁵.

Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government.¹²² While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.¹²³ In a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon.¹²⁴ Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities.¹²⁵ Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.¹²⁶",

These include inadvertent harm during military operations, attacks stemming from misidentification or misunderstanding of commercial activities, and deliberate targeting through physical or non-physical means during conflict. It remains uncertain when or how these threats might manifest on the Moon or affect lunar satellites.¹²⁷ While it is true, as baseball player Lawrence Peter “Yogi” Berra famously remarked, that “[i]t’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future,”¹²⁸ the global geopolitical landscape currently reflects a gradual trend towards conflict.¹²⁹ While humanity should aspire for the Moon to remain a “sanctuary of peace,” it is hard to have confidence in this aspiration. Even if we remain hopeful, it is essential for the commercial lunar stakeholders to prepare and ensure the protection of their assets. The cybersecurity landscape for lunar satellites remains uncharted and continually evolving. Thus, tailoring protective measures to address the challenges that these satellites will likely encounter is paramount. Among others, the following measures are recommendable: (1) implementation of a robust encryption/secured system for data transmission and strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access;¹³⁰ (2) shielding satellites systems from radiation-induced errors or data corruption by utilizing radiation-hardened components or implementing error-correction codes;¹³¹ (3) development ieee.org/cybersecurity-in-space (arguing that cyberthreats targeting crewed spacecraft could involve tactics like infiltrating a craft’s internal computer system with malware or ransomware through close approaches).

Satellite Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts While no recorded case of kinetic attacks on satellites exist,¹⁶¹ satellites have often been exposed to electronic and cyberattacks.¹⁶² It is worth noting that, from an international law perspective, an argument can be made that a satellite is a quasi-extension of a state's territory because of the quasi-jurisdiction principle of Article VIII of the OST.¹⁶³ Whether Article II OST¹⁶⁴ would bar satellites as a quasi-extension of a state's territory falls beyond the scope of this paper.¹⁶⁵ However, it is important to point out that Article II seems to only refer to land,¹⁶⁶ and it likely emerged from a concern about preventing the \"colonization\" of outer space.¹⁶⁷ This allows for the interpretation that the provision might not necessarily forbid considering a satellite as an extension of a state's territory. Even assuming the inability of states to claim satellites as extensions of their territory, this would not preclude the ¹⁵⁹. See id.

Interference claims typically remain undisclosed within intelligence circles and are seldom publicly confirmed. As discussed in Part II of this paper, both governments and private entities have been involved in satellite cyberattacks. Indeed, all the countries mentioned above—and many others—have the potential to engage in cyber-activities related to satellites; China, Russia, and the U.S. often employ misleading and obstructive tactics targeting each other's satellites.¹⁷⁸ In many cases, it is more speculation than certainty.

These tactics are certainly unlawful,¹⁸⁰ and, if attribution is possible,¹⁸¹ the affected state has the right to take countermeasures. Furthermore, if the tactic rises to the level of an “armed attack,” the situation could escalate to an international armed conflict.¹⁸² Spoofing, jamming, or dazzling affect satellites that are primarily used for national security or defense. Conversely, satellites with different applications, such as search and rescue satellites or civilian telecommunications, do not seem to face similar targeting.¹⁸³ Consequently, the satellite’s function, and particularly its contribution to defense or national security, appears to be a key factor in determining its susceptibility to these non-kinetic interferences.¹⁸⁴ Affected states have never officially attributed the attacks that they suffered to a specific state.¹⁸⁵ In the absence of formally attributed attacks, there is no precedent or established examples to indicate the threshold at which these interferences would prompt a response from the affected state. It would not be correct to read the absence of a reaction as a recognition that these interferences are necessarily lawful. However, we could at least imply that states, at the moment, would seem to tolerate these minimal interferences with their military or quasi-military satellites.¹⁸⁶ If this mindset carries over to lunar activities, there is a possibility that states might also accept these minor disruptions on the Moon. However, the approach might diverge concerning satellites not involved in military or quasi-military functions, potentially resulting in a different response to their attacks. Also, the unique lunar environment is characterized by its harsh conditions, where compromising even a single satellite could lead to catastrophic consequences.

The existence of an “armed attack” is essential for justifying the use of force in self-defense, making it an integral part of the ius ad bellum. Also, when an “armed conflict” occurs, it activates for the belligerents the application of the ius in bello.¹⁹¹ Article 2.4 of the UN Charter¹⁹² provides that “[a]ll Members must abstain from the threat or use of force in their international relations against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This provision establishes the principle of non-aggression, rendering the use of force, threats of force, including acts of aggression and military interventions, illegal against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence. Notably, it also prohibits any use or threat of force that contradicts the United Nations’ purposes. Three instances exist where the prohibition of use of force within or against another state is lawful: (1) that state’s consent; (2) authorization from the UN Security Council; and (3) individual or collective self-defense.¹⁹³ This paper does not discuss the topic of states’ consent¹⁹⁴ or the UN Security Council’s authorization;¹⁹⁵ and it focuses on the right of self-defense, as specifically relevant to a reaction to a cyberattack on a satellite. Self-defense is a principle of customary international law, which is also recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter, which qualifies it as “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.”¹⁹⁶ This right exists whether exercised individually or collectively by states (as under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty).¹⁹⁷ Under the principle of self-defense, a state is allowed to employ force when confronted with an “armed attack.” Nevertheless, the pivotal issue lies in the definition of an “armed attack,” which ultimately determines the applicability of the right to self-defense.¹⁹⁸ The UN Charter does not provide a specific definition for the term “armed attack,” and records from the UN Charter’s drafters provide no definitive explanation of the term.¹⁹⁹ Scholars suggest that the inexplicit definition of “armed attack” may exist because the concept was thought to be self-evident.

In an initial draft presented by the U.S. to the Five Powers (China, France, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom), it was stated that if the Security Council failed to prevent aggression and it occurred against any member state, that state had an inherent right to take necessary self-defense measures. During that era, two treaties, the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance and Solidarity and the Pact of the League of Arab States, also equated aggression with attack.²⁰⁰ In general, scholars consider an “armed attack” as being more severe and significant than a mere use of force indicating that an action could amount to use of force without reaching the level of an “armed attack.” The distinction between forms of force that qualifies as “armed attacks” and actions that imply the use of force, but fall short of being an “armed attack” is unclear, even if some guidance is offered by the international case law.²⁰¹ Particularly important is the Nicaragua case,²⁰² which adopts the “scale and effects” test to judge whether particular hostile actions directed at a state reach the level of an “armed attack.” The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) specified, for instance, that an event as minor as a “border incident” does not qualify as an “armed attack.”²⁰³ Along the same lines, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission²⁰⁴ determined that “geographically limited clashes” in a “remote, unmarked, and disputed border” were not enough to be considered an “armed attack.” Likewise, “localized border encounters” involving “small infantry units,” even resulting “in loss of life” are not an “armed attack.”²⁰⁵ The Nicaragua case clarified that sending regular armed forces across a border or using irregular militias generally constitutes an armed attack. However, providing weapons to rebels across borders does not meet the threshold.

APPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF “ARMED ATTACK” TO CYBERATTACKS In modern conflicts, cyberattacks can disrupt critical information assets, communications, and weapons systems. Cyberattacks can also cause political disruption by targeting finance, energy, transportation, and government services, thus creating social unrest.²¹⁴ In sum, a cyberattack can inflict damage well beyond that of a single bombardment.²¹⁵ Can a cyberattack be classified as \"an armed attack\" under the UN Charter?²¹⁶ Our discussion centers on cyberattacks existing independently of larger warfare contexts, such as the Ukrainian war.²¹⁷ The focus is on singular or multiple cyberattacks that, devoid of any other military actions, could be perceived as acts of aggression against national security. The possibility for a cyberattack to rise to the level of an \"armed attack\" relevant under the UN Charter is the object of some debate. This paper takes the position that a satellite cyberattack can constitute—in the sinking of an American steamboat (Caroline) used by Canadian insurgents, on orders of the British, caused a famous exchange of letters between United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British representative Lord Ashburton. *Id.* That correspondence is referred to as establishing the elements of the customary international right of self-defense. Webster wrote to Ashburton: \"Under these circumstances, and under those immediately connected with the transaction itself, it will be for her majesty's government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of national law, the destruction of the 'Caroline' is to be defended. It will be for that government to show a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" *Id.* ²¹³. This paper does not discuss another self-defense restriction: a state invoking self-defense, must quickly inform the UN Security Council. The Council, under Chapter VII, is chiefly responsible for authorizing force in situations jeopardizing global peace, making decisions to maintain or restore it, potentially endorsing force if needed. ²¹⁴.

Cyber warfare involves cyberattacks targeting nations, causing potential harm to critical infrastructure and even loss of life. However, defining what qualifies as cyber warfare remains a subject of debate among cybersecurity experts, with some suggesting it includes attacks that can result in fatalities. What is Cyber Warfare?, IMPERVA, https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/cyber-warfare/ (last visited Feb. 28, 2024). CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] itself—an “armed attack,” even if this will be rare. According to several scholars, cyberattacks can rise to the level of “armed attacks” as the UN Charter’s regulation regarding the use of force can be expanded to encompass cyberattacks conducted by one state against another through interpretative means. Several states share this position. For example, the United Kingdom asserted that, under specific circumstances, a cyberattack can be considered the equivalent of an “armed attack” triggering the right of self-defense. Ireland has adopted the “scale and effect” test, stating that use of force “may include instances where a cyber-operation does not cause physical damages such as where there is significant impairment of functionality of critical infrastructure.” “The circumstances under which non-injurious and non-destructive cyber operations might reach the use of force threshold remains a point of uncertainty among States.” However, only in “exceptional circumstances” could a cyber operation “reach this threshold.”²¹⁸ France asserted that the threshold for the use of force in cyberspace is not solely determined by the digital tools employed, but by the impact of the cyber operation itself. If the effects of a cyber operation resemble those of traditional weaponry, it breaches the prohibition on using force between states.²¹⁹ France acknowledges that even without physical consequences, a cyber operation could qualify as a use of force, in case of severe economic cyber impacts.²²⁰ France also declared the need to evaluate several criteria, including the operation’s origin, instigator’s nature, intrusion level, intended effects, and target, determines this assessment.²²¹ Singapore proclaimed that the factors to consider are several, including the context during the cyber operation, its origin, the intended or actual impact, the level of intrusion, and the characteristics of the target.²²² Singapore and Norway also recognized the possibility of severe economic cyber impacts being seen as an “armed attack.”²²³ Beyond general views expressed on the topic as discussed above, there are no official statements from states regarding specific instances of cyberattacks. Consequently, experts have sought to bridge this gap in state practice by offering their insights on how international law applies in this domain.²²⁴ Particularly authoritative in this debate is",

SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE Space has not seen direct armed conflict yet, but, unfortunately, it may be only a matter of time. As the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report put it: We know from history that every medium—air, land and sea—has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different. Given this virtual certainty, the U.S. must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space. This will require superior space capabilities.²²⁹ Currently, “despite international efforts to stem . . . militarization, outer space is now seen by some as a viable theater of future warfare, nature of the connection, if any, between the cyber activity and the particular armed conflict in question”).

Rule 73 (“Imminence and immediacy”) of the Tallinn Manual provides, “[t]he right to use force in self-defense arises if a cyber armed attack occurs or is imminent. It is further subject to a requirement of immediacy.”²⁴² This paper also discussed how proportionality and necessity are also an issue in self-defense.²⁴³ Just as with a physical attack, the response of a targeted state to a cyberattack must align with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, the state is allowed only to take actions necessary to halt the attack or prevent additional ones. Rule 72 (“Necessity and proportionality”) of the Tallinn Manual provides “[a] use of force involving cyber operations undertaken by a State in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate.”²⁴⁴ As the scope of a legitimate self-defense in cyberspace is debatable, afflicted countries are generally cautious when responding to cyberattacks due to the potential for escalation. Typically, diplomatic avenues are prioritized over immediate military or cyber counterattacks in retaliation. Lastly, as for physical attacks, collective self-defense (e.g., NATO) is also allowed.²⁴⁵",

CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] ## 2. Ius in Bello and Its Application to Satellite Cyberattacks The *ius in bello* governs the conduct of the hostilities, and has evolved over centuries. The *jus in bello* includes the laws of armed conflict (“LOAC”), alternatively known as international humanitarian law (“IHL”).²⁴⁶ This paper takes the position that IHL applies to conflicts in outer space,²⁴⁷ considering that the ICJ held that the IHL “applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future.”²⁴⁸ Consistent is the Tallinn Manual, which unambiguously provides that “[c]yber operations executed in the context of an armed conflict are subject to the law of armed conflict.”²⁴⁹ However, contrary opinions exist.²⁵⁰ There is limited discourse on applying IHL to satellites in lunar or other celestial bodies’ orbits, which is not surprising considering the early stage of the lunar economy and the presence of only a few satellites around the Moon. However, once the principle of IHL applying in outer space is accepted, there is no reason to restrict IHL application to Earth’s orbits. This paper only briefly outlines IHL principles and examines their application in space, specifically focusing on satellites. The following discussion will briefly cover: (1) military necessity; (2) distinction; (3) proportionality; (4) precautions; (5) the principle of constant care; and (6) the principle of avoiding widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment. Military necessity mandates that any action in an international armed conflict must be justified as necessary to gain a clear military advantage.²⁵¹ Distinction requires a clear differentiation between civilians and combatants, as well as civilian and military objectives with operations directed solely at military objects.²⁵² Military objectives are those contributing to military action through their nature, location, purpose, or use, and when their (partial or total) destruction, capture, or neutralization provides a clear military advantage.²⁵³ Rule 93 of the Tallinn Manual clarifies that",

THE OUTER SPACE TREATY AND THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES VIS-À-VIS SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS ## A. THE OST PROVISIONS RELEVANT FOR SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS ### 1. Articles II, III, VIII, and IX of the OST This paper examines now the regulations governing outer space, primarily outlined in the OST, which apply during both peacetime and wartime.²⁷⁸ Thus, it is a crucial consideration when addressing cyberthreats to satellites. However, this paper takes the position that the principles of *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* are “the *lex specialis* during armed conflict and prevail over the general law of outer space.”²⁷⁹ Several provisions potentially impact the issue of cyberattacks on lunar satellites. First, Article II of the OST, which likely aimed at preventing the “colonization” of outer space,²⁸⁰ and which specifies, “[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”²⁸¹ The prevailing view asserts that this non-appropriation principle applies to both States and private ²⁷⁸.

This provision establishes a form of jurisdiction similar to the concept of a “flag” state, resembling territorial control over the registered space object",

While more specific than other provisions of the OST, Article IV uses general language and lacks crucial definitions, especially as it pertains to terms such as \"weapons of mass destructions,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"military.\"298 Article IV(1) establishes a ban on certain types of weapons in space (\"nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\"), which cannot be placed \"in orbit around the earth,\" installed \"on celestial bodies,\" \"or stationed in outer space in any other manner.\"299 It does not impose restrictions on non-weapons of mass destruction.300 Article IV(1) of the OST has no bearing on the capacity to protect lunar satellites against cyberattacks. In fact, neither nuclear weapons nor weapons of mass destruction are requisite for deterring cyberattacks on lunar satellites. Not only are these weapons unnecessary, but they would also run counter to the principle of proportionality, which governs both the employment of countermeasures for international wrongful acts and the lawful response to \"armed attacks\" in self-defense. ## 3. Article IV(2) of the OST Article IV(2) of the OST provides that \"the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes\" and bans \"[t]he establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies.\" It provides two exceptions to this overarching prohibition: (1) \"[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,\" and (2) \"[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.\" Article IV(2) of the OST could potentially impact the capacity for deterrence and defense against cyberattacks if it were deemed applicable to orbital regions—a stance this paper does not support—as elucidated below.

In providing that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used . . . exclusively for peaceful purposes,” the provision would seem to exclude the possibility to militarily defend the assets. Even assuming that this provision does indeed pertain to orbital regions, this provision should not be construed as limiting the right of self-defense. First, the right of self-defense is a well-established norm of customary international law, solidified in Article 51 UN Charter. Its significance and authority are unlikely to be susceptible to influence by a provision framed in such broadly general terms as Article IV(2). Therefore, the right of self-defense must exist in outer space (contrary views exist).³⁰¹ Second, in case of an armed conflict, ius ad bellum and ius in bello are lex specialix that prevail the OST. Article 103 of the UN Charter provides that in cases where members of the United Nations have conflicting obligations under the current Charter and other international agreements, the obligations under the UN Charter shall prevail.³⁰² Third, the term “peaceful” under Article IV(2) should be interpreted as “non-aggressive” and not “as non-military.”³⁰³ The term “peaceful” also appears in the Preamble, Article IX, and Article XI. However, it is only in Article IV(2) that the term “peaceful” is paired with “exclusively,” creating a distinct regulatory emphasis on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Some scholars have pointed out that this is significant to give a special regime to the Moon and other celestial bodies, no matter how the term “peaceful” is interpreted within the OST, the crucial point lies in how Article IV(2) combines it with the term “exclusively.”³⁰⁴",

Markoff, Disarmament and Peaceful 2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES 711 This paper takes a different perspective. Although interpreting Article IV(2) in accordance with established interpretation principles necessitates considering the adverb \"exclusively,\"[305] the presence of the adverb \"exclusively\" does not alter the fact that the UN Charter (and the inherent right of self-defense) takes precedence over the OST. In addition, \"peaceful\" should be interpreted as \"non-agressive\" and state practice reflects this interpretation.[306] Since the 1950s, space has been utilized for military purposes, carrying a national security implication. Space was initially employed for reconnaissance and then predominantly in a passive capacity during the Cold War. During the Cold War, space was also used for nuclear capability assessments and as national technical means for verification of the non-proliferation treaties.[307] In sum, the military usage of space gradually broadened.[308] Overall, the utilization of space for military purposes expanded over time. It was with the Gulf War in the 1990s, often termed the inaugural \"space war,\" that space assets were actively employed for military operations within a theater of war.[309] Also, the second part of Article IV(2) poses no hindrance to the deterrence and defense of lunar satellites. It explicitly prohibits the utilization of celestial bodies for military bases, weapon testing, and military maneuvers. Arguably, deterrence and protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks are unlikely to necessitate the establishment Purposes Provisions in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, Spring 1976, Number 1, at 3, 16 (internal quotation omitted) (arguing that \"this use . . . excludes all kinds of military, and not only warlike activities on planets other than the Earth\"); Bin Cheng, Properly Speaking, Only Celestial Bodies Have Been Reserved for Use Exclusively for Peaceful (Non-Military) Purposes, but Not Outer Void Space, 75 INT'L.

CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] of military bases, weapon testing, or any military maneuvers. However, if that were the case, the two explicitly stated exceptions to this provision would come into play. As mentioned, these exceptions are as follows: (1) “[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,” and (2) “[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.” Either of these exceptions provides ample flexibility to permit deterrence and protection of lunar satellites. In fact, the satellites slated for deployment around the Moon, at least initially, will serve “scientific research or other peaceful purposes,” such as experiments and enabling lunar mining. An argument can be constructed, therefore, that the deployment of “military personnel” essential for deterring and defending these satellites should fall under this exception. Additionally, under the second exception, the use of any equipment or facility necessary for deterring attacks on and safeguarding these satellites should also be permissible, even if generally prohibited by the overarching provision of the latter part of Article IV(2) because at least initially the lunar satellites will be “necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon.” Furthermore, this paper argues that Article IV(2) exclusively applies to the Moon and celestial bodies themselves and does not encompass lunar orbits (as well as the orbits of other planets).[310] Lunar orbits and similar regions can be arguably considered part of empty outer space, exclusively covered by Article IV(1). Consequently, if the need for military defense against cyberattacks on lunar satellites were to arise, it would be legal to station military personnel and equipment in the vicinity of the Moon or lunar orbit (as opposed to the lunar surface). There are several reasons why Article IV(2) does not extend to these orbits. First, the general principle is that Article I of the OST's freedom of use applies to \"empty outer space,\"[311] while the regulation of celestial bodies is the exception. Given that Article IV(2) contains an exception to a general principle, it should be narrowly construed. Second, at least some orbits (i.e., Earth's orbit) have been used \"militarily\" since the inception of the space age, and no state has significantly objected to that use.[312] Therefore, state practice supports the argument that orbits are empty outer space and are not covered by Article IV(2).

Given that an expansive interpretation of Article IV(2) would pose a substantial obstacle to the exercise of the right of self-defense (in essence, potentially hindering any military protection of lunar installations), it is advisable not to construe Article IV(2) broadly to encompass lunar orbits. Fourth, the Moon Agreement, which holds limited direct significance today, can serve as a valuable tool when used ex contrario to offer insights for interpreting the OST.314 This approach suggests that if the Moon Agreement addresses a particular issue, it may indicate that the OST does not encompass that specific aspect. This is notably applicable to Article 1(2) of the Moon Agreement, which explicitly includes \"orbits around or other trajectories to or around it\" in the Moon's definition, and Article 3 of the Moon Agreement, which provides a more detailed framework for regulating military activities on the Moon.315 Extending the Moon's governance structure to lunar orbit based on the",

NATO’s POSITION The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), established in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty,³⁶⁵ is a political and military alliance created as a collective defense organization among North American and European countries, totaling thirty-two members.³⁶⁶ Collective defense is NATO’s bedrock: NATO members pledge to consider an attack against any of its members as an attack against all, triggering a duty to respond collectively.³⁶⁷ Equally significant is the aspect of defense planning, meaning that the members collaborate on planning their defense and developing military capabilities against security challenges. Also crucial is the aspect of cooperative security, which means that NATO cooperates with non-member countries and international organizations to promote security and stability, such as conventional military threats, terrorism, and hybrid warfare, and cyberattacks. To comprehend NATO’s stance on cyberattacks targeting satellites, it is essential to recognize that the matter resides at the intersection of NATO’s position on satellite defense and its response to cyberattacks. NATO has been increasingly focused on protecting and defending its members’ satellites, considering that satellites are crucial to communication, navigation, reconnaissance, and military operations. In 2019, NATO officially recognized space as an operational domain “alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace.”³⁶⁸ --- ³⁶⁴.

Both satellites and ground-based facilities are potential targets for these threats.371 NATO's goal is not to become an independent space player,372 but to enhance and contribute to the efforts of its member states and collaborate with other pertinent international organizations.373 This includes enhancing space domain awareness374 in cooperation with space agencies and advancing counter-space capabilities and technologies for safeguarding space assets, including cybersecurity defense. NATO has reaffirmed its long-standing belief that cyberspace is continuously contested by various state and non-state actors.375 Most notably, NATO's robust engagement in cyber defense and the role of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (\"CCDCOE\") are evidenced by the Tallinn Manual.376 An important example of NATO's approach regarding a specific cyberattack exists. In 2007, Estonia endured a massive cyberattack from Russia, which was likely provoked by the controversial relocation of a Red Army statue to a cemetery. The cyberattacks persisted for weeks, impacting banks, media communications%2C%20navigation%20%20and%20intelligence (last visited Mar. 16, 2024).",

TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67. 2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES 723 outlets, government bodies, and websites, causing widespread disruption. Estonia invoked Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, alleging an attack by Russia. However, NATO determined that the events did not meet the threshold of an “armed attack,” reflecting an effects-based approach to assessing cyberattacks. Referring to UN Charter Article 51, NATO concluded that Russia’s actions did not qualify as an “armed attack,” and therefore, the right to self-defense for NATO member states did not come into effect.³⁷⁷ It is challenging to predict what NATO would do in case of a cyberattack on the Moon because it is a vastly different environment compared to Earth, and the impact of a cyberattack on a satellite or group of satellites may vary significantly. Also, on the Moon a cyberattack could be more impactful (due to the scarcity of satellites) or less impactful (due to the limited number of people affected). However, one could make a reasonable argument that if NATO did not view the extensive 2007 cyberattack in Estonia as meeting the criteria for a cyberattack requiring collective self-defense, it would be even more unlikely for NATO to categorize an attack on a lunar satellite in that way. ## C. OTHER SPACEFARING COUNTRIES VIS-À-VIS LUNAR SATELLITES ### 1. China China’s progress in space technologies, initially non-military in nature, carries significant military implications because of their dual-use potential.³⁷⁸ This duality is evident in Chinese space missions like lunar exploration, where technologies developed for these purposes—such as robotics, radar networks, and materials—have the potential for military adaptation. While China may not explicitly articulate military intentions for space in their policies or directives, and consistently advocates for the use of outer space only for “peaceful purposes.”³⁷⁹ ³⁷⁷.

The Chinese White Papers “are silent on China’s policies about Space-based and/or Earth-based weapons for targets in Space. . . . There is no mention of investments in technologies like jamming technology.” *Id.* The truth, however, is that “[t]he emphasis in the White Papers is on the civilian aspects of the Chinese Space programme.” *Id.* at 9. ³⁷⁹. *China’s Space Program: A 2021 Perspective*, THE STATE COUNCIL INFO.

In section I, subsection 3, China reaffirmed to have “always advocated the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes any attempt to turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield or launch an arms race in outer space.” *Id.* The 2021 White Paper does not address military activities in space and only briefly references the defense of national security. CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] China's practice has suggested otherwise.³⁸⁰ China has indeed employed space for military objectives, and the military plays a crucial role in the Chinese space program.³⁸¹ BeiDou—China's GNSS system—serves as a prime example, demonstrating China's strategic utilization of dual-use technology to bolster its geopolitical influence.³⁸² Evidence of China's military focus in space includes the recent establishment of the Information Support Force (“ISF”), a military branch aimed at providing strategic support for network information systems under the Central Military Commission’s control to strengthen military capabilities through informatization and intelligence. This reorganization also involved dismantling the Strategic Support Force (“SSF”) and creating the Aerospace Force (“AF”) and Cyberspace Force (“CF”).³⁸³ Evidence suggests that China regularly utilizes jamming and spoofing methods on GPS satellites to safeguard sensitive areas from drone surveillance or potential attacks. Additionally, there are reports of China targeting U.S. government satellites on a daily basis.³⁸⁴ If China gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable China might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well. China has also developed ground-based laser systems designed to dazzle the optical sensors of spy satellites as they pass over sensitive sites to temporarily prevent the satellite from taking a picture or physically damage the image sensor.³⁸⁵",

CONCLUSION This paper has delved into the issue of cyber-threats for satellites in non-Earth orbits, particularly in lunar orbits, amid escalating cyber-risks. The growing cislunar and lunar economy will heighten vulnerability, especially for commercial lunar satellites lacking robust protection. Just as Earth-orbiting satellites have faced increasing threats, lunar satellites will be confronted with similar risks in the expanding lunar economy. With a limited number of satellites orbiting the Moon, this paper has drawn insights from threats facing Earth's satellites to anticipate risks for lunar counterparts, focusing specifically on cyberthreats. Cyberthreats pose unique challenges due to attribution complexities and scope of the right of self-defense. This paper has examined cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and as armed attacks, assessing affected states' rights to self-defense. Considering provisions in the UN Charter and the OST, this paper has concluded that Article IV of the OST cannot be interpreted as impeding the right of self-defense of lunar satellites. Even if certain restrictions exist, this paper has argued that the right of self-defense would prevail when constrained by these limitations. Preserving security for both government and commercial satellites remains crucial for U.S. national interests, and it will become paramount on the Moon as well. The recognition that the right of self-defense is not diminished in space is an important component of satellite security. ³⁹³. Dong L.

CONCLUSION 726\nThis paper delves into the legal complexities surrounding the protection of non-Earth satellites, specifically lunar satellites within the expanding cislunar space, and focuses on the emerging cyberthreats confronting these satellites within the burgeoning lunar economy, drawing parallels with Earth's satellite security to anticipate future challenges. Highlighting the intricate nature of cyber threats and their impact on both governmental and commercial satellites, this paper examines cyberattacks as potential international wrongful acts and armed attacks. This paper evaluates the right of affected states to self-defense and scrutinizes Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty (\"OST\"), alongside other pertinent treaties' provisions. This paper concludes that Article IV of the OST should not be interpreted as to impede the right of self-defense for lunar satellites, and claims that the inherent right of self-defense overrides the OST's restrictions, allowing for protection for lunar satellite assets.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nThis paper discusses the legal issues of protecting satellites in lunar (and other non-earth) orbits from cyberattacks. Lunar satellites are included in the \"cislunar\" space but present special characteristics that differentiate them from the satellites around Earth. This paper focuses on lunar satellites due to the expanding cislunar and lunar economy. This expansion is expected to result in an escalation of cyberrisks for lunar satellites—particularly for commercial ones, which have less robust protection compared to their military counterparts. Similar to Earth-orbiting satellites—upon which our economy has come to rely—which are facing growing threats from competitors and adversaries openly expressing their intention to disrupt these satellites in times of conflict, lunar satellites are likely to face the same threats, with the expansion of the lunar economy.\nDue to the limited number of satellites currently orbiting the Moon, this paper analyses the threats faced by Earth's satellites and derives insights applicable to lunar satellites. Potential adversaries are constantly trying to capitalize on perceived weaknesses in space capabilities, and satellites are exposed to several threats (including physical/kinetic, non-kinetic/physical, electronic, and cyber); however, this paper focuses on\n1. 42 U.S.C. § 18302 (defining \"Cis-lunar space\" as \"the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon\").\n2.

Cyberthreats are different from the other threats because establishing attribution in cyberattack cases is especially difficult, and assessing damages—particularly under the Liability Convention—would be complex, thus making it even more challenging to seek satisfaction. Preserving the security of both governmental and commercial satellites is essential for the United States national interests.\nThis paper will discuss in Part III(E) and Part IV, respectively, cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and cyberattacks as “armed attacks.” In both cases, the affected state has a right to react, albeit with differing degrees of severity. Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”) prohibits use of force or threat thereof. Self-defense (including collective self-defense as in the North Atlantic Treaty) stands as an exception as per Article 51 of the UN Charter, incorporating a fundamental principle within customary international law. This paper examines if a cyberattack qualifies as use of force, granting affected states the right to countermeasures, and, if the cyberattack escalates to an armed attack, whether self-defense permits the use of force or threat thereof.\nThe Preamble of the Outer Space Treaty (“OST”) frames exploration and use of space as an aspirational principle. However, “peaceful purposes” is not defined by the OST. Article IV of the OST—which is a rare instance in which the Moon and other celestial bodies are treated separately and distinct from the empty outer space—is the\n7. Erwin, supra note 4.\n8. The level of attribution varies, with the kinetic/physical attacks being the easiest to attribute, followed by the non-kinetic physical ones, with the electronic and cyber having the most difficult attribution. The issue of attribution is very challenging in cybersecurity. First, technical attribution is difficult. Second, even if technical attribution is possible, the problem of legal attribution remains.\n9. U.N.G.A.

THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF LUNAR SATELLITES\nIn the lunar economy, both governmental entities and private enterprises will need dependable navigation and communication capabilities. Under the Artemis program, a unified communication system will support all missions; The European Space Agency (“ESA”) will supply a complete network of satellites, which will operate through the Moonlight initiative consortium. Lockheed Martin’s subsidiary, Crescent Space Services LLC, will provide Parsec, a lunar orbit satellite network catering to communication services for lunar spacecraft and surface operations. Anticipating a clientele mix from commercial entities and governmental organizations like NASA, the company will commence operations with two owned and operated satellites, scheduled\n48.

First, for lunar communication: in order to maintain contact with assets on the lunar surface, lunar satellites will serve as communication relay stations, enabling data transfer, audio/video communication, and command and control of lunar rovers/other equipment.58 Upcoming lunar missions anticipate reliance on emerging cislunar space networks, comprising a special network for communication including relay satellites, orbiters, and spacecraft.59 With the establishment of a stable presence on the Moon, the communication need will be even more pressing. Before its Chang'e-4 mission, China positioned Queqiao, a relay satellite, into a halo orbit beyond the Moon. Its primary objective was to facilitate communication between Earth-based ground stations and the Far Side, where the Chang'e-4 lander would operate.60 To support its Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8, China launched another relay satellite, named Queqiao-2.61\nSecond, for navigation and positioning: lunar activities (including landing, navigation, mapping, and mining) will likely use satellite systems like Global Navigation Satellite System (\"GNSS\") or lunar-specific positioning systems to provide accurate location information\n56.

Fourth, for lunar exploration and scientific experiments: lunar satellites (e.g., remote sensing satellites) will play a crucial role in analyzing the lunar surface and mapping it, and in conducting scientific experiments from lunar orbit. For example, China has been experimenting with a quantum cis lunar satellite. Fifth, for espionage: because several stakeholders will operate on the Moon (and will often be adversary) lunar satellites will also play a reconnaissance role.

CYBER-RISKS FOR SATELLITES\n### A. SELECTED EXAMPLES OF SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\nSatellite hacking has occurred on multiple occasions. In 2011, the U.S. issued a report, revealing that cyber-intruders (possibly connected to Chinese military groups) had disrupted the operations of two U.S. government satellites on four separate occasions in the previous years. Troubling incidents of cyberattacks have happened in connection with the Ukrainian War. Immediately prior the invasion, Russia initiated a massive cyberattack against ViaSat, a satellite company, disabling and infecting all the ground modems responsible for transmitting signals to/from the satellites, rendering the systems inoperable. The attack impacted not only Ukraine (which used ViaSat for military communication) but also other Central and Eastern European nations,\n68. Katherine Fang et al., A Right to Spy?

Amtel-Svyaz, the parent company of Dozor, acted swiftly, taking control of one network while three remained down. Dozor-Teleport did not disclose specific attack details, and it is unclear whether the terrestrial network was affected or the satellites themselves. A self-proclaimed “hacktivist” organization and a branch of the Wagner Group both claimed responsibility, asserting that they sent malicious software to the satellite terminals.74 In 2022, Elon Musk revealed that SpaceX’s Starlink satellites had been subjected to numerous cyberattacks in the wake of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.75\n## B. WHY SATELLITES ARE PARTICULARLY EASY TARGETS FOR CYBERATTACKS\nA satellite could be attacked kinetically or non-kinetically. “Kinetic” means actions involving physical force or direct contact, such as bombings and other types of attacks that cause physical damage, while “non-kinetic” attacks are those that do not involve a direct physical force. A cyberattack—the focus of this paper—is a form of non-kinetic attack being carried out by digital means to compromise, disrupt, or damage data, infrastructure, or communication. The term “cyberattack” has several definitions, including the following: “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident or transiting these systems or networks.” Cyberattacks are performed through malware, hacking, denial-of-service, and other tactics aimed at compromising or disrupting computer systems, networks, and data. A cyberattack can aim at stealing sensitive information, or causing system malfunctions, or blocking the system (unblocking it only after the payment of a sum of money called ransomware).\nCyberattacks are not the only possible form of non-kinetic attacks. Spoofing (use of deceptive or fraudulent electronic data or communications to deceive, manipulate a system, or disguise the attacker’s\n73.

Scholars Georgeson and Stubbs explain that satellites are vulnerable due to several factors: (1) they are typically unshielded; (2) they follow predictable orbits, (3) they have limited maneuverability, (4) they are \"few enough in number\" that their destruction could have substantial repercussions; (5) replacing them is costly and consuming; and (6) numerous satellites have dual-use functionality, providing services to the military and to civilians, making them potential targets for enemy attacks.80\nNot all of the factors mentioned above are equally relevant to protection against cyberattacks. As for shielding:81 while shielding against destructive attacks like kinetic anti-satellite missiles is difficult, protection against non-kinetic attacks is feasible (e.g., to safeguard against electronic attacks, a shutter shield could protect specific sensors or satellite lids; shielding could be effective against blinding lasers or dazzlers). Shielding satellites against kinetic attacks is not only challenging but also costly, as it increases expenses not only during\n76. While different from a cyberattack, spoofing can be used in a cyberattack to trick the system into believing that the source of a cyberattack is a legitimate source. For example, in a phishing attack, attackers may use email spoofing to make an email appear as though it comes from a trusted source.

Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\ndevelopment but also during launch due to the added weight.82 Dissimilarly, protection against cyberattacks does not necessitate an increase in weight, and therefore launch costs. While development expenses are still a consideration, it is crucial for all satellite operators to create a robust cybersecurity system.\nAs for predictability of orbit and fuel scarcity: satellites follow predictable orbits,83 not only due to the laws of physics, but also because they carry limited fuel—which restricts their ability to make significant changes to their orbits. Additionally,84 technical limitations on maneuverability and fuel scarcity result in satellite operators being unable to make rapid maneuvers, even if they detect that an attack is coming.85 Cyberattacks would not be affected by predictability of orbit or limited maneuverability because cyberattacks happen in the \"cyberworld,\" where maneuverability is not necessary; only a robust cybersecurity program is essential.\nIn terms of the limited number (i.e., lack of redundancy of satellites), the landscape is swiftly evolving.86 While satellites remain relatively scarce, LEO constellations are significantly altering this scenario in many instances, making lack of redundancy somewhat less impactful. However, this is not universally applicable to every satellite type or operator. In certain instances, operators might not possess hundreds or thousands of satellites performing the same functions; they might have only a few, which play a pivotal role in providing crucial services.87 All things considered, satellites are still relatively few in number.88\n82.

Stating:\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIn addition to the above factors, there are factors specific to cyberattacks, such as a lack of system redundancies, the remote nature of satellite operations, and limited or outdated computer resources. Some of the satellites lack system redundancy. System redundancy involves incorporating supplementary components, resources, or elements within a satellite that are not strictly essential for its operation but are included to improve reliability, availability, fault tolerance, and overall robustness.[92] Although redundant systems can still be susceptible to cyberattacks,[93] redundancy could mitigate the risk because, if a component is compromised due to a cyberattack, other components might be capable of fulfilling its functions. Today satellites—at least the larger ones—are designed with redundancy in mind.[94]\n[Satellites] are still relatively few in number (so destroying or damaging even a handful could have a major impact); they are \"soft\" (lacking heavy shielding or the ability to defend themselves from attack); they usually follow known, predictable orbital paths, with little ability to undertake evasive maneuvers (so they are easily trackable \"sitting ducks\").\nId.\n89.

Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks;[95] if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands.[96] Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.[97]\nAs for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging.[98] Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.[99]\n## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY\nSatellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation.[100] Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations.[101] In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite.\nConsidering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly.\n95.

Lunar satellites will face geophysical threats coming from the Moon's environment.\nThe main concern is that the Moon is not nearby enough to quickly address these issues. Therefore, planned lunar missions must be sustainable and autonomous. In regards to cybersecurity, when planning lunar missions, scientists and engineers must use various models to approximate real conditions—such as thermal environments, difficulties in communications and navigation systems, placement and maneuvering of the spacecraft, as well as generation and storage of the power. However, uncertainties, unknowns, or unforeseen circumstances on the Moon may pose hazards for lunar missions.\nNo documented cyberthreats have targeted satellites in lunar orbits, but security breaches in space agencies have sparked worries about mission safety. NASA frequently discloses cybersecurity issues, such as unauthorized attempts to access its systems. In 2019, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported a data breach resulting from unauthorized access. Though these incidents might not have caused visible harm, NASA and other government entities and organizations must always focus on safeguarding their digital assets and infrastructure.\nRecognizing the critical role of lunar satellites, the 2022 National Cislunar Science &amp; Technology Strategy (\"NCS&amp;T Strategy\"), in outlining its key objectives, provided for the need to \"implement Cislunar communications and PNT capabilities with scalable and interoperable approaches\" and for the extension of \"space situational awareness capabilities into Cislunar space.\" The NCS&amp;T Strategy contains two specific mentions of cybersecurity, clarifying that cybersecurity is\n.

For example, as addressed above, the predictability of orbits increases the propensity to attacks but; predictability of orbit is not to be considered a problem for cislunar satellites. These satellites have the opposite problem; satellite orbits tend to shift continuously unless they are positioned in proximity of Lagrange points L4 and L5. As the lunar economy advances, both government and commercial satellite operators must remain vigilant in safeguarding their assets, even if they perceive cyber-risks as unlikely. This perception of unlikelihood could pose a particular challenge for commercial actors. Conversely, governments have been concerned about cybersecurity threats since the inception of the space program. The government should be proactive in safeguarding commercial systems in a space protection plan because threats to commercial actors’ lunar\n. Id. at 13.\n. Id.\n. M. J.

Lunar commercial actors may initially show minimal enthusiasm for addressing security concerns, similar to the findings that reflected their lack of interest in discussing security matters for satellites in Earth's orbit, as revealed in a 2018 survey. Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government. While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.\nIn a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon. Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities. Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.\n121. Id. at 18.\n122.

Additionally, governments should consider providing incentives to encourage private entities to implement suitable cybersecurity measures for lunar satellites.\nSecuring lunar satellites is crucial as they determine the safety of lunar operations. Inspired by the ESA's depiction of lunar economic aspects, diverse potential scenarios emerge. ESA lists several “[a]pplication Areas Supporting a Sustainable Lunar Presence.” For example, the Moon will have solar panel farms for the production of electricity, water extraction facilities, manufacturing facilities utilizing regolith as construction material, transportation services, habitation to house humans, food production installations, waste management facilities, health services, educational facilities, entertainment facilities, smart infrastructures, and other services.\nCyber operations on the Moon and other celestial bodies may be conducted only for peaceful purposes.

What potential catastrophic effects might result from a cyberattack that compromises these operations? How concerning would a cyberattack on food production or resource management be? Additionally, what risks would a cyberattack on the smart infrastructure controlling and maintaining lunar facilities pose? A cyberattack of this kind could easily qualify as an international wrongful act. More severe cyberattacks, such as the simultaneous targeting of all state lunar facilities, could even qualify as an \"armed attack\" by employing the scale/effect-based approach.\n136.

General Discussion Regarding Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nEven if uncertainties exist, numerous states, including the U.S., hold the view that the current international legal framework adequately governs the conduct of states in cyberspace. According to international law, a cyberattack could fall along the spectrum of international responsibility, use of force, and possibly armed attack. The boundaries between these scenarios are not always clearly defined.\nInternational responsibility comes into play when there is a violation of an obligation attributable to a state. An international wrongful act—which is a foundational principle in customary international law—causes a novel legal relationship to arise between states when there is a breach of an international obligation by one of them. In fact, the breach triggers a shift from a primary rule—which is a rule dictating state conduct—to a secondary set of rules of responsibility. Article 2 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ARSIWA”) defines an international wrongful act as a conduct—either action or omission—that is contrary to what a State is required to do by international law, including violations of treaties and customary international law, that is attributable to the State. When the breach is attributable to a state, it initiates a new relationship called a “secondary rule,” which evokes legal consequences for the breaching state. Articles 28–36 of ARSIWA outline the legal ramifications of an internationally wrongful act. The legal framework aims to resolve disputes peaceably without escalating to war. It encompasses the obligation of the breaching state to cease the wrongful conduct, prevent its recurrence, rectify the situation, pay damages, or give satisfaction.\nRule 14 of the Tallinn Manual (“Internationally wrongful cyber acts”) provides that a state bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to a state and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation. The focus is on acts that are less severe than the use of force, but still carry international repercussions, such as the obligation to provide reparation.\n Brian J. Egan, *International Law and Stability in Cyberspace*, 35 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 169, (2017).\n GAOR, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf [hereinafter ARSIWA]. While the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts formulated by the International Law Commission (“ILC”), do not possess inherent legal binding force, they do codify principles of customary international law, which are indeed binding. These principles outline guidelines regarding state responsibility.\n See TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 67, and accompanying text.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\n144. A cyberattack is not a wrongful act in several circumstances, including when it is the result of self-defense, countermeasures, and necessity. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 19 (“Circumstances precluding wrongfulness of cyber operations”).\n145. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 15 (“Attribution of cyber operations by State organs”). “Cyber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” Id.\n146. ARSIWA Articles 4–11 outline when actions by various entities are seen as acts of a state in international law. Articles 4 and 5 encompass actions by state organs or recognized entities, including authorized individuals yielding governmental authority. Articles 6 and 7 clarify that organs provided by one state to another and actions by state entities, even when exceeding authority, are considered state acts. Articles 8 and 9 define state acts as actions under state control or exercised in the absence of official control, both qualifying as state acts. Articles 10 and 11 address actions of insurrectional movements as state acts, attributing related conduct to those states. Lastly, Article 11 specifies that conduct not directly attributed to a state may be recognized as an act of the state if acknowledged and adopted. See also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, Rule 17 (“Attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors”). “Cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control; or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own.” Id.\n147. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 18 (“Responsibility in connection with cyber operations by other States”).\n148. BERGAMASCO, ET AL., CYBERSECURITY: KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, supra note 70, at 119–20 (noting how the practical significance of cyber activities by non-governmental entities is limited because a state can only authorize and oversee cyber activities a state is informed about). Even if these criteria are met, establishing clear attribution for cyber activities, which is often not feasible, remains an unresolved issue. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nThe affected state has the right to take countermeasures, but does not have to respond with a cyberattack. Countermeasures need not be in kind but must not be indiscriminate; their sole purpose should encourage responsible behavior aligned with the affected state's rights. Furthermore, the countermeasures must not violate human rights, or engage in prohibited belligerent actions, breach peremptory norms, or violate diplomatic and consular inviolability. The countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury suffered. and cannot breach a legal obligation owed to a third party.\nSome states have taken a clear position on when cyberattacks constitute an international wrongful act. For example, in 2018, the United Kingdom, declared that cyber operations targeting another state's territory, even below the use of force threshold, can breach international law. Consequently, the affected state, with clear attribution, can take non-forceful, necessary, and proportionate countermeasures directed at the offending state to restore compliance. In 2019, Estonia adopted a similar stance, releasing a statement on countermeasures in the event of a cyberattack. The U.S. made a similar pronouncement in 2021. Ireland followed suit in 2023. France took a similar stance, and went so far as to qualify cyberattacks as a possible violation of sovereignty. Some states also provided extensive declarations regarding the legality\n149. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 24 (\"States entitled to take countermeasures\"). Only an injured State may engage in countermeasures, whether cyber in nature or not. Id.

Satellite Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nWhile no recorded case of kinetic attacks on satellites exist, satellites have often been exposed to electronic and cyberattacks. It is worth noting that, from an international law perspective, an argument can be made that a satellite is a quasi-extension of a state's territory because of the quasi-jurisdiction principle of Article VIII of the OST. Whether Article II OST would bar satellites as a quasi-extension of a state's territory falls beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is important to point out that Article II seems to only refer to land, and it likely emerged from a concern about preventing the \"colonization\" of outer space. This allows for the interpretation that the provision might not necessarily forbid considering a satellite as an extension of a state's territory. Even assuming the inability of states to claim satellites as extensions of their territory, this would not preclude the\n. See id.

In fact, the wrongful conduct does not need to occur in the territory of a state for a wrongful act to be found. The Tallinn Manual provides, for example, that a state can assert territorial jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure, individuals engaged in cyber activities within its borders, cyber activities originating from or concluding within its territory, and cyber activities that have a substantial effect within its borders. This provides more than classic territorial jurisdiction and likely covers cyberattacks on the Moon.\nAlthough the number of reported cases of satellite cyberattacks is limited, satellite cybersecurity is gaining increased attention.

These tactics are certainly unlawful, and, if attribution is possible, the affected state has the right to take countermeasures. Furthermore, if the tactic rises to the level of an “armed attack,” the situation could escalate to an international armed conflict. Spoofing, jamming, or dazzling affect satellites that are primarily used for national security or defense. Conversely, satellites with different applications, such as search and rescue satellites or civilian telecommunications, do not seem to face similar targeting. Consequently, the satellite’s function, and particularly its contribution to defense or national security, appears to be a key factor in determining its susceptibility to these non-kinetic interferences.\nAffected states have never officially attributed the attacks that they suffered to a specific state. In the absence of formally attributed attacks, there is no precedent or established examples to indicate the threshold at which these interferences would prompt a response from the affected state. It would not be correct to read the absence of a reaction as a recognition that these interferences are necessarily lawful. However, we could at least imply that states, at the moment, would seem to tolerate these minimal interferences with their military or quasi-military satellites. If this mindset carries over to lunar activities, there is a possibility that states might also accept these minor disruptions on the Moon. However, the approach might diverge concerning satellites not involved in military or quasi-military functions, potentially resulting in a different response to their attacks. Also, the unique lunar environment is characterized by its harsh conditions, where compromising even a single satellite could lead to catastrophic consequences. Such conditions could make it challenging to quickly\n179. Dana A. Goward, *Now Hear This - ‘Misnavigation’ or Spoofing?*, U.S. NAVAL INST.

In fact, armed conflicts are governed by two distinct bodies of law.

The existence of an “armed attack” is essential for justifying the use of force in self-defense, making it an integral part of the ius ad bellum. Also, when an “armed conflict” occurs, it activates for the belligerents the application of the ius in bello.\nArticle 2.4 of the UN Charter provides that “[a]ll Members must abstain from the threat or use of force in their international relations against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This provision establishes the principle of non-aggression, rendering the use of force, threats of force, including acts of aggression and military interventions, illegal against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence. Notably, it also prohibits any use or threat of force that contradicts the United Nations’ purposes. Three instances exist where the prohibition of use of force within or against another state is lawful: (1) that state’s consent; (2) authorization from the UN Security Council; and (3) individual or collective self-defense.\nThis paper does not discuss the topic of states’ consent or the UN Security Council’s authorization; and it focuses on the right of self-defense, as specifically relevant to a reaction to a cyberattack on a satellite. Self-defense is a principle of customary international law, which is also recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter, which qualifies it as “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.” This right exists whether exercised individually or collectively by states (as under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty). Under the principle of self-defense, a state is allowed to employ force when confronted with an “armed attack.” Nevertheless, the pivotal issue lies in the definition of an “armed attack,” which ultimately determines the applicability of the right to self-defense.\nThe UN Charter does not provide a specific definition for the term “armed attack,” and records from the UN Charter’s drafters provide no definitive explanation of the term. Scholars suggest that the inexplicit definition of “armed attack” may exist because the concept was thought to be self-evident. The drafters and negotiators consistently viewed aggression as the catalyst for justifiable self-defense. They\n191. Blank, supra note 189, at 250.\n192. U.N. CHARTER, supra note 12.\n193.

United Nations Conference on International Organization held in San Francisco, California, from April 25 to June 26, 1945.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIn general, scholars consider an “armed attack” as being more severe and significant than a mere use of force indicating that an action could amount to use of force without reaching the level of an “armed attack.” The distinction between forms of force that qualifies as “armed attacks” and actions that imply the use of force, but fall short of being an “armed attack” is unclear, even if some guidance is offered by the international case law. Particularly important is the Nicaragua case, which adopts the “scale and effects” test to judge whether particular hostile actions directed at a state reach the level of an “armed attack.” The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) specified, for instance, that an event as minor as a “border incident” does not qualify as an “armed attack.” Along the same lines, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that “geographically limited clashes” in a “remote, unmarked, and disputed border” were not enough to be considered an “armed attack.” Likewise, “localized border encounters” involving “small infantry units,” even resulting “in loss of life” are not an “armed attack.” The Nicaragua case clarified that sending regular armed forces across a border or using irregular militias generally constitutes an armed attack. However, providing weapons to rebels across borders does not meet the threshold. The physical impact of an action—including evaluation of the territorial intrusion, casualties, or significant property damage—is a key consideration. Bombardments or kinetic attacks, only qualify as “armed attacks” if\n200.

However, in the Oil Platforms case, the court ruled that “the mining of a single military vessel could be sufficient to meet the definition of an ‘armed attack.’”\nAs discussed, at the United Nation San Francisco Conference of 1945, aggression was considered as the trigger for legitimate self-defense, specifically recognizing “armed attack” as a severe and separate form of aggression. For this reason, non-binding UN Resolution 3314 of the 1974 (“Definition of Aggression”) remains relevant for defining the term “armed attack.” Article I provides that “[a]ggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition.” Article II provides that “the First use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression” (unless the UN Security Council determines otherwise) while Article III goes on to list some examples of acts of aggression—like invasion, bombardment, blockade of ports, sending troops or mercenaries in another state, et cetera.\nThis paper will not delve any further on the general concept of “armed attack,” the previous discussion should adequately convey the complexity of this concept, which becomes even more challenging when applied to cyberattacks. Furthermore, imminence and immediacy are crucial; the right to use self-defense arises when an “armed attack” is ongoing or impending. The latter is commonly referred to as anticipatory self-defense (“Caroline Test”). Lastly, when evaluating\n206. Oil Platforms (Iran v.

APPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF “ARMED ATTACK” TO CYBERATTACKS\nIn modern conflicts, cyberattacks can disrupt critical information assets, communications, and weapons systems. Cyberattacks can also cause political disruption by targeting finance, energy, transportation, and government services, thus creating social unrest. In sum, a cyberattack can inflict damage well beyond that of a single bombardment. Can a cyberattack be classified as \"an armed attack\" under the UN Charter? Our discussion centers on cyberattacks existing independently of larger warfare contexts, such as the Ukrainian war. The focus is on singular or multiple cyberattacks that, devoid of any other military actions, could be perceived as acts of aggression against national security.\nThe possibility for a cyberattack to rise to the level of an \"armed attack\" relevant under the UN Charter is the object of some debate. This paper takes the position that a satellite cyberattack can constitute—in\nthe sinking of an American steamboat (Caroline) used by Canadian insurgents, on orders of the British, caused a famous exchange of letters between United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British representative Lord Ashburton. *Id.* That correspondence is referred to as establishing the elements of the customary international right of self-defense. Webster wrote to Ashburton: \"Under these circumstances, and under those immediately connected with the transaction itself, it will be for her majesty's government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of national law, the destruction of the 'Caroline' is to be defended. It will be for that government to show a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" *Id.*\n. This paper does not discuss another self-defense restriction: a state invoking self-defense, must quickly inform the UN Security Council. The Council, under Chapter VII, is chiefly responsible for authorizing force in situations jeopardizing global peace, making decisions to maintain or restore it, potentially endorsing force if needed.\n.

Cyber warfare involves cyberattacks targeting nations, causing potential harm to critical infrastructure and even loss of life. However, defining what qualifies as cyber warfare remains a subject of debate among cybersecurity experts, with some suggesting it includes attacks that can result in fatalities.

According to several scholars, cyberattacks can rise to the level of “armed attacks” as the UN Charter’s regulation regarding the use of force can be expanded to encompass cyberattacks conducted by one state against another through interpretative means. Several states share this position. For example, the United Kingdom asserted that, under specific circumstances, a cyberattack can be considered the equivalent of an “armed attack” triggering the right of self-defense. Ireland has adopted the “scale and effect” test, stating that use of force “may include instances where a cyber-operation does not cause physical damages such as where there is significant impairment of functionality of critical infrastructure.” “The circumstances under which non-injurious and non-destructive cyber operations might reach the use of force threshold remains a point of uncertainty among States.” However, only in “exceptional circumstances” could a cyber operation “reach this threshold.” France asserted that the threshold for the use of force in cyberspace is not solely determined by the digital tools employed, but by the impact of the cyber operation itself. If the effects of a cyber operation resemble those of traditional weaponry, it breaches the prohibition on using force between states. France acknowledges that even without physical consequences, a cyber operation could qualify as a use of force, in case of severe economic cyber impacts. France also declared the need to evaluate several criteria, including the operation’s origin, instigator’s nature, intrusion level, intended effects, and target, determines this assessment. Singapore proclaimed that the factors to consider are several, including the context during the cyber operation, its origin, the intended or actual impact, the level of intrusion, and the characteristics of the target. Singapore and Norway also recognized the possibility of severe economic cyber impacts being seen as an “armed attack.”\nBeyond general views expressed on the topic as discussed above, there are no official statements from states regarding specific instances of cyberattacks. Consequently, experts have sought to bridge this gap in state practice by offering their insights on how international law applies in this domain. Particularly authoritative in this debate is\n218.

SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE\nSpace has not seen direct armed conflict yet, but, unfortunately, it may be only a matter of time. As the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report put it:\nWe know from history that every medium—air, land and sea—has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different. Given this virtual certainty, the U.S. must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space. This will require superior space capabilities.\nCurrently, “despite international efforts to stem . . . militarization, outer space is now seen by some as a viable theater of future warfare,\nnature of the connection, if any, between the cyber activity and the particular armed conflict in question”). Egan points out that a growing number of states, as evidenced by various GGE reports, are acknowledging the applicability of international law to cyberspace, but seldom states openly express their views on the application of this law to particular cyber activities.

While it would seem generally accepted that, akin to physical conflicts, nations possess an inherent right to self-defense in the event of cyberattacks, the boundary of this right remains uncertain in international law, especially on whether the use of force is justified in response to a cyberattack.\n1. Rule 51 (Self-defence against armed attack) Application to Cyberattacks\nWhile Article 51 UN Charter broadly encompasses various forms of attacks, including cyberattacks, the Tallinn Manual appropriately clarifies that a state targeted by a cyberattack maintains the right to self-defense. Rule 71 (“Self-defence against armed attack”) provides: “A State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.” Some states have taken a stance on the right of self-defense in the case of cyberattacks. In 2018, the United Kingdom released the following statement: “It is clear that cyber operations that result in, or present an imminent threat of, death and destruction on an equivalent scale to an armed attack will give rise to an inherent right to take action in self-defence, as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The United Kingdom firmly believes that cyber operations leading to, or posing an immediate risk of, severe harm or destruction comparable to an “armed attack” warrant the inherent right to respond in self-defense, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. Canada also recognizes “that the inherent right of self-defence if an ‘armed attack’ occurs against a state also applies in cyberspace.”\n230.

Id.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nEstablishing attribution in case of a cyberattack that raises to the level of an armed attack is just as difficult as it in case of a cyberattack that does not raise to the level of an armed attack, as we discussed above. Technical attribution is difficult because a cyberattack can be launched from anywhere and perpetrators are often able to conceal their identity, and equally difficult is the attribution to a particular country. However, because in an armed conflict “cyberattacks frequently accompany and facilitate conventional attacks, attribution is less problematic when an armed conflict is already undergoing.”\nThis paper discussed how self-defense requires imminence and immediacy, i.e. application of the Caroline Test. Self-defense in case of a cyberattack is no exception. Rule 73 (“Imminence and immediacy”) of the Tallinn Manual provides, “[t]he right to use force in self-defense arises if a cyber armed attack occurs or is imminent. It is further subject to a requirement of immediacy.” This paper also discussed how proportionality and necessity are also an issue in self-defense. Just as with a physical attack, the response of a targeted state to a cyberattack must align with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, the state is allowed only to take actions necessary to halt the attack or prevent additional ones. Rule 72 (“Necessity and proportionality”) of the Tallinn Manual provides “[a] use of force involving cyber operations undertaken by a State in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate.”\nAs the scope of a legitimate self-defense in cyberspace is debatable, afflicted countries are generally cautious when responding to cyberattacks due to the potential for escalation. Typically, diplomatic avenues are prioritized over immediate military or cyber counterattacks in retaliation. Lastly, as for physical attacks, collective self-defense (e.g., NATO) is also allowed.\n237. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67.\n238. See supra Part III(E)(1).\n239. See supra Part III(E)(1).\n240.

Ius in Bello and Its Application to Satellite Cyberattacks\nThe *ius in bello* governs the conduct of the hostilities, and has evolved over centuries. The *jus in bello* includes the laws of armed conflict (“LOAC”), alternatively known as international humanitarian law (“IHL”). This paper takes the position that IHL applies to conflicts in outer space, considering that the ICJ held that the IHL “applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future.” Consistent is the Tallinn Manual, which unambiguously provides that “[c]yber operations executed in the context of an armed conflict are subject to the law of armed conflict.” However, contrary opinions exist. There is limited discourse on applying IHL to satellites in lunar or other celestial bodies’ orbits, which is not surprising considering the early stage of the lunar economy and the presence of only a few satellites around the Moon. However, once the principle of IHL applying in outer space is accepted, there is no reason to restrict IHL application to Earth’s orbits.\nThis paper only briefly outlines IHL principles and examines their application in space, specifically focusing on satellites. The following discussion will briefly cover: (1) military necessity; (2) distinction; (3) proportionality; (4) precautions; (5) the principle of constant care; and (6) the principle of avoiding widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment. Military necessity mandates that any action in an international armed conflict must be justified as necessary to gain a clear military advantage. Distinction requires a clear differentiation between civilians and combatants, as well as civilian and military objectives with operations directed solely at military objects. Military objectives are those contributing to military action through their nature, location, purpose, or use, and when their (partial or total) destruction, capture, or neutralization provides a clear military advantage. Rule 93 of the Tallinn Manual clarifies that\n246. Frans G. von der Dunk, *Armed Conflicts in Outer Space: Which Law Applies?*, 97 INT’L L.

Scholars note that sometimes the purpose of a space object is unclear, and a civilian or commercial space object can be easily converted to military use by reprogramming it to handle military data. Regarding the \"definitive military advantage\" requirement, the challenge in space arises from the potential for shifting object locations, changing ownership, or altered circumstances that may render the destruction of a space object no longer providing a clear military advantage. Complications arise from the dual-use nature of many space objects, serving both military and civilian roles (like the GPS system). Dual-use objects are considered military targets under the principle of distinction. However,\n254. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 93 (\"Distinction\").\n255. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 99 (\"Prohibition of attacking civilian objects\"). Rule 100 (\"Civilian objects and military objectives\") distinguishes civilian objects from military objectives. Civilian objects encompass everything that is not a military objective. Military objectives are objects that, due to their nature, location, purpose, or use, significantly contribute to military actions and their destruction, capture, or neutralization at the time provides a clear military advantage. Cyber infrastructure can potentially be categorized as a military objective. Id.\n256. Georgeson &amp; Stubbs, supra note 80, at 615.\n257. Id. (internal citation omitted).\n258. Id. at 616.\n259.

Koplow, ASAT-isfection, supra note 88, at 1194 (making the point that dual use, i.e. when an object serves both military and civilian needs, is common for the United States but also for other countries). Among the countries that utilized dual-use satellites is Russia. See generally Zak, supra note 175 (mentioning that the line between civilian and military use of most Russian orbital assets is often unclear). Applications like communications, navigation, remote sensing, and weather forecasting are crucial for both sectors. These assets can be considered dual-use since government-controlled entities use them for various purposes. Id. at 4.

This is consistent with the provision of the Tallinn Manual in point of cyber infrastructure. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 101 (\"Objects used for civilian and military purposes\"). \"Cyber infrastructure used for both civilian and military purposes is a military objective.\" Id. Rule 112 (\"Clearly separated and distinct military objectives\") is also significant, providing that \"[a] cyber attack that treats as a single target a number of clearly discrete cyber military objectives in cyber infrastructure primarily used for\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nevaluating whether those objects can be disrupted requires weighing other principles like proportionality, precautions, and ongoing care. Proportionality dictates that an attack should not result in excessive collateral damage to civilians or non-military objects, in relation to the expected, specific, and direct military advantage. The assessment necessitates weighing projected civilian losses against military gains, taking into account all available information.\nRule 113 of the Tallinn Manual dictates the prohibition to perform a “cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.” When a satellite is dual-use, proportionality is a significant concern because an attack on such a system could result in substantial civilian impact, making proportionality a potential barrier to attacking those objects. Precautions mandate attackers to exercise caution in their choice of attack methods, and presents a significant obstacle to targeting space objects, particularly due to the potential creation of space debris—a likely outcome if we are talking of kinetic attacks. Scholars suggest that a kinetic attack on a ground station might be the preferred method to achieve a clear military advantage while adhering to the principle of precautions. Rule 121 of the Tallinn Manual mandates the implementation of precautions as well.\nSatellite cyberattacks could be a viable option under the principle of precautions as it can blind satellites without generating debris. The principle of constant care (“requiring that constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians, and civilian objects”) requires evaluation of the impact on civilians, even when they are not in close proximity. This affects the proportionality balance. Rule 114 of the Tallinn Manual dictates that “during hostilities involving\ncivilian purposes is prohibited if to do so would harm protected persons or objects.” Id. at Rule 112 (“Clearly separated and distinct military objectives”).\n262.

Though not the main focus, IHRL factors like necessity, proportionality, precautions, and investigations are likely to impact decisions on satellite attacks, including cyberattacks. Applying IHRL to space raises concerns about potential violations of the right to life if individuals are killed through satellite targeting.\nIn conclusion, satellite cyberattacks generally adhere to most IHL principles, except potentially the principle of proportionality. The significant repercussions of destroying certain satellites, like the GPS system, may pose challenges due to their impact on the broader civilian population, potentially violating the principle of proportionality. When considering cyberattacks on lunar satellites, several critical factors come into play. The vast distance to the Moon necessitates autonomous operations, making immediate human intervention improbable.\n271. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 114 (“Constant Care”).\n272.

Id. at 628.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nAdditionally, the Moon presents harsh conditions, and any disruption to critical lunar satellites could result in catastrophic consequences. The implications of an attack on lunar satellites might not align with IHL principles, particularly concerning proportionality, as the magnitude of possible outcomes would far exceed acceptable limits, potentially causing indiscriminate harm. This raises concerns about the compatibility of such actions with the established framework of IHL. Furthermore, the growing lunar economy and increased human presence on the Moon will magnify the significance of IHRL concerns. As the utilization of lunar resources expands and human activities on the Moon increase, IHRL considerations are likely to emerge as pressing issues that need careful examination.\n## V. THE OUTER SPACE TREATY AND THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES VIS-À-VIS SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n## A. THE OST PROVISIONS RELEVANT FOR SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n### 1. Articles II, III, VIII, and IX of the OST\nThis paper examines now the regulations governing outer space, primarily outlined in the OST, which apply during both peacetime and wartime. Thus, it is a crucial consideration when addressing cyberthreats to satellites. However, this paper takes the position that the principles of *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* are “the *lex specialis* during armed conflict and prevail over the general law of outer space.” Several provisions potentially impact the issue of cyberattacks on lunar satellites. First, Article II of the OST, which likely aimed at preventing the “colonization” of outer space, and which specifies, “[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.” The prevailing view asserts that this non-appropriation principle applies to both States and private\n. See, e.g., *id.* at 649 (citing to Michael N. Schmitt, *International law and military operations in space*, 10 Max Planck Y.B. U.N. L. 89 (2006); Dale Stephens &amp; Cassandra Steer, *Conflicts in space international humanitarian law and its application to space warfare*, 40 Annals Air &amp; Space L. 71 (2015); Macak, *Silent War*, supra note 250.).\n.

See Eller, supra note 167.\n. OST, supra note 17, at Art. II.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nSecond, Article III of the OST, which mandates that states conduct activities in line with international law—including the UN Charter—and aims to uphold international peace, security, cooperation, and understanding. As a result of this provision, the use of force and its threat are forbidden under Article 2.4 of the UN Charter, except as permitted by Article 51 (pertaining to self-defense) and decisions of the UN Security Council.\nThird, Article VIII OST, which stipulates that a state retains jurisdiction and control over an object launched into outer space under its registry. This registration implies authority over the registered object. Consequently, a satellite circling the Moon falls under the jurisdiction of the state that officially registered it. This provision establishes a form of jurisdiction similar to the concept of a “flag” state, resembling territorial control over the registered space object\n282. See, e.g., Ricky J. Lee, Article II of the Outer Space Treaty: Prohibition of State Sovereignty, Private Property Rights, or Both, 11 AUSTL. INT’L L.J. 128, 129 (2004) (highlighting how the prohibition must include private entities: because per Article VI, “any act of national appropriation by private entities would be subject to the direction or influence of the State”).\n283. See, e.g., Stephen Gorove, Interpreting Article II of the Outer Space Treaty, 37 FORDHAM L. REV. 349 (1969). The basis of the argument is the adjective “national” in the language “national appropriation.” Id.\n284. See supra Part III(E)(2).\n285. See supra Part IV(A).\n286. OST, supra note 17, at Art. III.\n287. COLOGNE COMMENTARY ON SPACE LAW: Vol. I 65 (Stephan Hobe et al., eds., Carl Heymanns Verlag 2009) [hereinafter COLOGNE COMMENTARY I].\nA major imperative for declaring international law, including the UN charter, applicable to outer space, was the overriding concern for the maintenance of international peace and security, which, after all, is the primary purpose and responsibility of the United Nations (UN) and the fear for an arms race in outer space. Thus, generally accepted rules and principles, such as the prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defense, would also be in force in outer space. Id. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n288. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n289. Michael Chatzipanagiotis &amp; Rafael Moro-Aguilar, Criminal Jurisdiction in International Space Law: Future Challenges in view of the ISS IGA, 57 PROC. INT’L INST. SPACE L. 323, 328 (2014).\nThe registry of a space object has the same legal consequences as registering a ship or an aircraft. The only difference is that in Space Law, inclusion in the national registry does not confer nationality de jure to the spacecraft, only jurisdiction and control thereon. However, in practice such inclusion entitles the State of registry to exercise its sovereignty over the registered object. This amounts to a quasi-nationality or nationality de facto of the space object.\nId.\n290. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nakin to an airplane flagged with a particular state. Notably, Article VIII applies solely to “launched” objects, excluding items constructed in space. Therefore, it will not be applicable to satellites constructed directly in lunar orbits.\nFourth, Article IX: this paper will only briefly mention the principle of due regard. “In the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty . . . shall conduct all their activities in outer space . . . with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty.” Due regard, akin to a primary “duty of care,” stands as a potential mechanism for international responsibility regarding wrongful acts. For example, if State A (or one of its nationals) conducts a cyberattack on a lunar satellites of State B (or one of its nationals), State A would not show proper consideration for the activity of State B. This would violate the obligation of due regard, activating the secondary rule of responsibility previously addressed. The exact scope of due regard remains unclear as this provision has never been used, resulting in a dearth of established State practices. In practice, State parties seem hesitant or unwilling to directly acknowledge the concept of “due regard.”\n## 2. Article IV(1) of the OST\nThe only substantive provision of the OST dealing with military use is Article IV, which (1) prohibits placing in orbit/installing/stationing (as opposed to transiting) nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction in space; (2) requires using the Moon and other celestial bodies (but not empty space) “exclusively for peaceful purposes”; and\n291. Id.\n292. OST, supra note 17, at Art. IX. Among other deliberate omissions, this paper does not discuss the harmful interference principal also established by Article IX OST. The harmful interference principle provides that States can engage in international consultations if their space-related activities foreseeably interfere with other nations’ endeavors. Similarly, a State can request consultations if it believes another country’s space actions might disrupt peaceful space exploration. While this clause has potential relevance for lunar satellites, this paper does not discuss it because, for the way in which Article IX is framed, the provision would seem to refer to involuntary interference and not a cyberattack.\n293. Id.\n294. Michael J.

See supra Part III(A).\n296. Listner, The Paradox of Article IX, supra note 294, at 28 (discussing States’ reluctance to resort to Article IX OST).\n297. Member states have interpreted “peaceful” as “non-aggressive” not as “nonmilitary.” See, e.g., Fabio Tronchetti, *Legal aspects of the military uses of outer space*, in *HANDBOOK OF SPACE LAW* (Frans von der Dunk, ed., Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015), at 331–81.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nWhile more specific than other provisions of the OST, Article IV uses general language and lacks crucial definitions, especially as it pertains to terms such as \"weapons of mass destructions,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"military.\"298 Article IV(1) establishes a ban on certain types of weapons in space (\"nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\"), which cannot be placed \"in orbit around the earth,\" installed \"on celestial bodies,\" \"or stationed in outer space in any other manner.\"299 It does not impose restrictions on non-weapons of mass destruction.300\nArticle IV(1) of the OST has no bearing on the capacity to protect lunar satellites against cyberattacks. In fact, neither nuclear weapons nor weapons of mass destruction are requisite for deterring cyberattacks on lunar satellites. Not only are these weapons unnecessary, but they would also run counter to the principle of proportionality, which governs both the employment of countermeasures for international wrongful acts and the lawful response to \"armed attacks\" in self-defense.\n## 3. Article IV(2) of the OST\nArticle IV(2) of the OST provides that \"the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes\" and bans \"[t]he establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies.\" It provides two exceptions to this overarching prohibition: (1) \"[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,\" and (2) \"[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.\"\nArticle IV(2) of the OST could potentially impact the capacity for deterrence and defense against cyberattacks if it were deemed applicable to orbital regions—a stance this paper does not support—as elucidated below. Before delving into the rationale for this position, let us assess the implications of Article IV(2) of the OST within the specific\n298. COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 71 (arguing that the article lacks definitions that could clarify terms such as \"military uses of space weapon\" and \"peaceful uses,\" preventing a clear differentiation between \"peaceful\" and \"exclusively peaceful\").\n299. OST, supra note 17, at Art. IV(1).\n300. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OFF. GEN.

In providing that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used . . . exclusively for peaceful purposes,” the provision would seem to exclude the possibility to militarily defend the assets. Even assuming that this provision does indeed pertain to orbital regions, this provision should not be construed as limiting the right of self-defense. First, the right of self-defense is a well-established norm of customary international law, solidified in Article 51 UN Charter. Its significance and authority are unlikely to be susceptible to influence by a provision framed in such broadly general terms as Article IV(2). Therefore, the right of self-defense must exist in outer space (contrary views exist). Second, in case of an armed conflict, ius ad bellum and ius in bello are lex specialix that prevail the OST. Article 103 of the UN Charter provides that in cases where members of the United Nations have conflicting obligations under the current Charter and other international agreements, the obligations under the UN Charter shall prevail. Third, the term “peaceful” under Article IV(2) should be interpreted as “non-aggressive” and not “as non-military.” The term “peaceful” also appears in the Preamble, Article IX, and Article XI. However, it is only in Article IV(2) that the term “peaceful” is paired with “exclusively,” creating a distinct regulatory emphasis on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Some scholars have pointed out that this is significant to give a special regime to the Moon and other celestial bodies, no matter how the term “peaceful” is interpreted within the OST, the crucial point lies in how Article IV(2) combines it with the term “exclusively.”\n301. This contrary view states that self-defense on celestial bodies is limited by Article IV OST. See, e.g., Arjen Vermeer, The Laws of War in Outer Space: Some Legal Implications for the Jus ad Bellum and the Jus in Bello of the Militarisation and Weaponisation of Outer Space, in THE NEW ORDER OF WAR (2010) at 6 (arguing that “Article IV OST precludes offensive and defensive military activity on celestial bodies”). See also Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 354 (citing authorities that question the applicability of the right of self-defense in outer space).\n302. While Article 103 talks of “obligations” and not “rights” under the convention, because Article 51 is complementary to Article 2.4 (ban on use of force and threat thereof), Article 103 should be read as to make Article 51 prevail over inconsistent provisions, too. Different interpretations are possible.\n303. See, e.g., Matthew G. Looper, International Space Law: How Russia and the U.S. are at Odds in the Final Frontier, 18 S.C. J. INT’L. L. &amp; BUS. 111, 113 (2022) (“Looper, International Space Law”).

Contrary view exists. See, e.g., Vermeer supra note 301.\n304. Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 340 (arguing that the combination of these terms holds significance, as the provision specifies that the moon and other celestial bodies should be utilized “exclusively for peaceful purposes only,” not “exclusively peaceful purposes”). This wording clarifies that any activity remains lawful as long as it maintains peaceful intent; however, once non-peaceful aspects are introduced, its legality is forfeited. In essence, the moon and other celestial bodies are intended to remain devoid of any military utilization. Id. See also, Marko G. Markoff, Disarmament and Peaceful\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nAlso, the second part of Article IV(2) poses no hindrance to the deterrence and defense of lunar satellites. It explicitly prohibits the utilization of celestial bodies for military bases, weapon testing, and military maneuvers. Arguably, deterrence and protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks are unlikely to necessitate the establishment\nPurposes Provisions in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, Spring 1976, Number 1, at 3, 16 (internal quotation omitted) (arguing that \"this use . . . excludes all kinds of military, and not only warlike activities on planets other than the Earth\"); Bin Cheng, Properly Speaking, Only Celestial Bodies Have Been Reserved for Use Exclusively for Peaceful (Non-Military) Purposes, but Not Outer Void Space, 75 INT'L.

Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War is commonly cited as the inaugural \"space war\" because of the extensive utilization of space-based capabilities throughout the conflict.

However, if that were the case, the two explicitly stated exceptions to this provision would come into play. As mentioned, these exceptions are as follows: (1) “[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,” and (2) “[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.” Either of these exceptions provides ample flexibility to permit deterrence and protection of lunar satellites. In fact, the satellites slated for deployment around the Moon, at least initially, will serve “scientific research or other peaceful purposes,” such as experiments and enabling lunar mining. An argument can be constructed, therefore, that the deployment of “military personnel” essential for deterring and defending these satellites should fall under this exception. Additionally, under the second exception, the use of any equipment or facility necessary for deterring attacks on and safeguarding these satellites should also be permissible, even if generally prohibited by the overarching provision of the latter part of Article IV(2) because at least initially the lunar satellites will be “necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon.”\nFurthermore, this paper argues that Article IV(2) exclusively applies to the Moon and celestial bodies themselves and does not encompass lunar orbits (as well as the orbits of other planets).[310] Lunar orbits and similar regions can be arguably considered part of empty outer space, exclusively covered by Article IV(1). Consequently, if the need for military defense against cyberattacks on lunar satellites were to arise, it would be legal to station military personnel and equipment in the vicinity of the Moon or lunar orbit (as opposed to the lunar surface). There are several reasons why Article IV(2) does not extend to these orbits. First, the general principle is that Article I of the OST's freedom of use applies to \"empty outer space,\"[311] while the regulation of celestial bodies is the exception. Given that Article IV(2) contains an exception to a general principle, it should be narrowly construed. Second, at least some orbits (i.e., Earth's orbit) have been used \"militarily\" since the inception of the space age, and no state has significantly objected to that use.[312] Therefore, state practice supports the argument that orbits are empty outer space and are not covered by Article IV(2). According to Article 31.3(b) of the Vienna Convention on\n310. See, e.g., COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 81–82 (making the argument that outer space is not covered by Article IV(2)).\n311.

Different opinions exist. See, e.g., Michael Listner, The Moon Treaty: failed international law or waiting in the shadows?, THE SPACE REV. (Oct. 24, 2011), https://www.thespacereview.com/article/1954/1 [hereinafter Listner, The Moon Treaty] (\"arguing that although only a few nations ratified the Moon Treaty, the participation of countries like Australia, France, and India as signatories create \"a shadow of customary law which could grow\" so that non-parties may be influenced by the Moon Treaty's shadow if they do not challenge its legitimacy\").\n315. Article 3 of the Moon Agreement provides:\n1. The moon shall be used by all States Parties exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n2. Any threat or use of force or any other hostile act or threat of hostile act on the moon is prohibited. It is likewise prohibited to use the moon in order to commit any such act or to engage in any such threat in relation to the earth, the moon, spacecraft, the personnel of spacecraft or man-made space objects.\n3. States Parties shall not place in orbit around or other trajectory to or around the moon objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction or place or use such weapons on or in the moon.\n4. The establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military maneuvers on the moon shall be forbidden. The use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited. The use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration and use of the moon shall also not be prohibited.\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nnecessity of using lunar orbit for lunar activities may seem logical. However, this argument is less compelling compared to the opposing view supported by the reasons mentioned earlier.\n## B. THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE ARRANGEMENTS\n### 1. The Other Space Treaties\nAfter the OST was enacted in 1967, several other significant treaties were signed between 1968 and 1976. These treaties, namely the Rescue Agreement, Liability Convention, and Registration Convention, also pertain to Moon activities and Moon satellites. None of these treaties are highly pertinent to the subject of this paper, except for the Liability Convention, which could be relevant if a cyber-attack results in measurable damage for which the victim-state seeks compensation.\nIn 1979—the Moon Agreement was signed—and it could have had the potential to significantly influence the subject of this paper. However, this treaty ultimately failed due to the limited number of ratifications. Therefore, while differing opinions exist, this paper contends that the dismissal of the Moon Agreement by the vast majority of states (including all major space-faring nations except India and Australia) renders it largely irrelevant for our analysis. However, as previously discussed, it can still serve a purpose when employed in a contrasting manner to enhance our understanding of the interpretation of OST. In other words, if the Moon Agreement found it necessary to address a particular issue, it implies that the OST does not cover that aspect.\n### 2.

Section 5 (“Interoperability”) provides that the Signatories acknowledge that the use of compatible and shared exploration infrastructure and standards (including standard for communication systems) advances exploration, scientific research, and commercial utilization. Therefore the Signatories commit to strive to employ existing interoperability standards, or to create new standards when current ones are absent or insufficient. Interoperability enhances cybersecurity and therefore, by providing this commitment, the Artemis Accords significantly increase protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks. Section 11 (“Deconfliction of Space Activities”), and in particular, Sections 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 are relevant. First, in Section 11.1, the Signatories reconfirm their commitment to the OST with alignment on provisions such as due regard and prevention of harmful interference. Second, in Section 11.3 the Signatories reaffirm the commitment to use due regard, as per Article IX of the OST. Section 11.3 also provides that if a Signatory fears or has suffered harmful interference, that Signatory can initiate a consultation with the other Signatory that authorized the activity (or any party to the OST). Lastly, Section 11.4 commits the Signatories to avoid deliberate actions that could lead to harmful interference with each other’s utilization of outer space. The impact of the above principles on cybersecurity for lunar satellites is undeniable.\ncooperation%20on%20Artemis %20is,of%20the%20 Outer%20Space%20Treaty (last visited Oct 28, 2023).\n.

DEFENDING MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITES\n## A. UNITED STATES' SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY AND DEFENSE\nWhile the attitude of the U.S. towards space exploration and use is peaceful, the United States has repeatedly reaffirmed its right to take countermeasures, its right of self-defense, and its intention to use these rights in case its space activities are threatened. For years, the U.S. has recognized the vulnerability of space objects to both physical attacks and cyberattacks. Already in 2001, the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report pointed out that “with the growing commercial and national security use of space, U.S. assets in space and on the ground offer just such targets. The U.S. is an attractive candidate for a ‘Space Pearl Harbor.’” The concept of space as a domain at risk is repeated in many documents of military doctrine:\n[I]n the contested, congested, and competitive space warfighting domain, our potential adversaries continue to develop, test, and proliferate sophisticated weapons. These weapons have the potential to be the most severe risks to orbital flight. To minimize this risk, it is imperative we execute threat-focused space operations that are fully integrated with timely and relevant intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.\nPresident Obama’s National Space Policy (“2010 NSP”) emphasizes the safeguarding of space assets mentioning the following necessities: (1) to ensure cost-effective resilience of space capabilities based on their planned use, potential consequences of capability loss, threat levels, and the availability of alternative means to fulfill missions; and (2) to develop and employ strategies and capabilities for the safeguard of critical national security space-dependent missions, including rapid asset restoration and leveraging diverse resources for mission execution. The 2010 NSP suggests proliferation of space capabilities as\n. 51 U.S.C. § 20102 (“Congressional declaration of policy and purpose”) provides that “Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.” *Id.*\n.

If deterrence fails, the right to self-defense is invoked in accordance with international law and treaty obligations.[334] The 2011 NSSS specified that, although the U.S. believes that all space-faring nations should strive to prevent space hostilities, it acknowledges that some actors might still see military advantage in space-based actions.[335] In 2018, the Trump Administration issued the U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy,[336] and instituted the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency.[337] Specifically on cybersecurity for space, the Trump Administration issued Space Policy Directive 5 - Cybersecurity Principles for Space System (\"SPD-5\"), which focused on cybersecurity for space systems and urged federal agencies and non-governmental space operators to establish cybersecurity norms.[338]\nIn 2020, the National Space Policy (\"2020 NSP\")[339] reaffirmed the right of self-defense providing that if any adversary jeopardizes the advantages that the U.S. gains from space, the U.S. will use all means to deter and, if needed, overcome hostile actions in space. The U.S. will continue to use space for national security, including the right of self-defense, as unfettered access and operational freedom in space\n333.

The 2020 NSP specifies that the U.S. regards intentional interference with space systems (including their support and infrastructure) as a violation of its national rights.\nThe focus of the 2020 NSP is on deterring and countering threats to the U.S. and their allies' space interests; it clarified that any attack on, or intentional interference with, these interests will be met with a calculated response at a time, place, and manner according to U.S. discretion. A cyberattack of a satellite is obviously an attack/intentional interference with a space system and will therefore be considered an infringement of the U.S.' rights. The U.S. will seek to deter that threat, but if unsuccessful will respond appropriately, and not necessarily in kind.\nThe 2020 NSP emphasizes the U.S.' intention of developing plans and capabilities to counter any interference or attack on U.S. or allied space systems, especially those vital for critical infrastructure, enabling a responsive approach as determined by the U.S. The 2020 NSP highlights that the U.S. aims for a secure, stable, and open space environment. It also recognizes that the space domain has evolved into a \"warfighting domain\" due to the actions of competitors. Noting the critical importance of space security for both U.S. and global stability, the 2020 NSP outlines the need for the U.S. to enhance its security systems, policies, and strategies to safeguard its space interests, dictating specific principles. The 2020 NSP designates Space Force as the main military branch for space, with the responsibility to organize, train, and equip forces to protect national interests in space and ensure access to space. Space Force will also supply forces for offensive, defensive, and support operations to U.S. Space Command and other commands. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with protecting the use of space for U.S. national security, economic interests, and those of allies and partners.

Recognizing that the convergence of the digital and physical realms poses a risk to national systems, the 2023 NCSS establishes three key principles:\n(1) obtaining global recognition that international law is applicable in cyberspace in times of peace or war; (2) obtaining consensus on norms of responsible behavior; and (3) promoting trust-building measures for inter-state cooperation. With specific reference to space, the 2023 NCSS notes how reliance on space assets is increasing cyberrisks, and the transition of numerous critical systems to digital platforms is exacerbating the potential damage from cyberattacks.\nThe 2023 NCSS also points out the increasing reliance of the government on the commercial sectors for national security needs.

For the purpose of this paper, Pillar Two is the most important because it: (1) outlines the U.S. strategy to employ all available means (including diplomacy, information, finance, intelligence, and law enforcement) to deter potential attackers from jeopardizing U.S. interests, and to halt malicious actors from conducting extended cyber-campaigns that are a threat to national security and public safety;[356] (2) expresses the U.S.' intention to execute continuous and precisely targeted \"disruption campaigns\" to dissuade cybercriminals from engaging in cyber-activities (including by making those activities unprofitable);[357] (3) promotes the private sector's collaboration via nonprofit organizations as central hubs for cooperation with the Government;[358] (4) highlights the Government's commitment to disrupt ransomware activities by rendering them unprofitable.[359] Pillar Three[360] deals with shaping market forces to drive security and resilience, (including insurance program),[361] while Pillar Four focuses on investments and incentives.[362]\nImplementation actions are necessary. In 2023 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") issued Introduction to Cybersecurity for Commercial Satellite Operations,[363] a document setting non-binding standards which lack specificity.

However, with the growth of the lunar economy, a more concentrated emphasis on the Moon is advised.\n## B. NATO’s POSITION\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), established in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty, is a political and military alliance created as a collective defense organization among North American and European countries, totaling thirty-two members. Collective defense is NATO’s bedrock: NATO members pledge to consider an attack against any of its members as an attack against all, triggering a duty to respond collectively. Equally significant is the aspect of defense planning, meaning that the members collaborate on planning their defense and developing military capabilities against security challenges. Also crucial is the aspect of cooperative security, which means that NATO cooperates with non-member countries and international organizations to promote security and stability, such as conventional military threats, terrorism, and hybrid warfare, and cyberattacks.\nTo comprehend NATO’s stance on cyberattacks targeting satellites, it is essential to recognize that the matter resides at the intersection of NATO’s position on satellite defense and its response to cyberattacks. NATO has been increasingly focused on protecting and defending its members’ satellites, considering that satellites are crucial to communication, navigation, reconnaissance, and military operations. In 2019, NATO officially recognized space as an operational domain “alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace.”\n---\n.

Both satellites and ground-based facilities are potential targets for these threats.371 NATO's goal is not to become an independent space player,372 but to enhance and contribute to the efforts of its member states and collaborate with other pertinent international organizations.373 This includes enhancing space domain awareness374 in cooperation with space agencies and advancing counter-space capabilities and technologies for safeguarding space assets, including cybersecurity defense.\nNATO has reaffirmed its long-standing belief that cyberspace is continuously contested by various state and non-state actors.375 Most notably, NATO's robust engagement in cyber defense and the role of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (\"CCDCOE\") are evidenced by the Tallinn Manual.376 An important example of NATO's approach regarding a specific cyberattack exists. In 2007, Estonia endured a massive cyberattack from Russia, which was likely provoked by the controversial relocation of a Red Army statue to a cemetery.

TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIt is challenging to predict what NATO would do in case of a cyberattack on the Moon because it is a vastly different environment compared to Earth, and the impact of a cyberattack on a satellite or group of satellites may vary significantly. Also, on the Moon a cyberattack could be more impactful (due to the scarcity of satellites) or less impactful (due to the limited number of people affected). However, one could make a reasonable argument that if NATO did not view the extensive 2007 cyberattack in Estonia as meeting the criteria for a cyberattack requiring collective self-defense, it would be even more unlikely for NATO to categorize an attack on a lunar satellite in that way.\n## C. OTHER SPACEFARING COUNTRIES VIS-À-VIS LUNAR SATELLITES\n### 1. China\nChina’s progress in space technologies, initially non-military in nature, carries significant military implications because of their dual-use potential. This duality is evident in Chinese space missions like lunar exploration, where technologies developed for these purposes—such as robotics, radar networks, and materials—have the potential for military adaptation. While China may not explicitly articulate military intentions for space in their policies or directives, and consistently advocates for the use of outer space only for “peaceful purposes.”\n. Damien McGuinness, *How a cyber attack transformed Estonia*, BBC NEWS (Apr. 17, 2017), https://www.bbc.com/news/39655415.\n. *China’s White Papers on Space*, supra note 33, at 8. The Chinese White Papers “are silent on China’s policies about Space-based and/or Earth-based weapons for targets in Space. . . . There is no mention of investments in technologies like jamming technology.” *Id.* The truth, however, is that “[t]he emphasis in the White Papers is on the civilian aspects of the Chinese Space programme.” *Id.* at 9.\n. *China’s Space Program: A 2021 Perspective*, THE STATE COUNCIL INFO.

In section I, subsection 3, China reaffirmed to have “always advocated the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes any attempt to turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield or launch an arms race in outer space.” *Id.* The 2021 White Paper does not address military activities in space and only briefly references the defense of national security.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nChina's practice has suggested otherwise. China has indeed employed space for military objectives, and the military plays a crucial role in the Chinese space program. BeiDou—China's GNSS system—serves as a prime example, demonstrating China's strategic utilization of dual-use technology to bolster its geopolitical influence. Evidence of China's military focus in space includes the recent establishment of the Information Support Force (“ISF”), a military branch aimed at providing strategic support for network information systems under the Central Military Commission’s control to strengthen military capabilities through informatization and intelligence. This reorganization also involved dismantling the Strategic Support Force (“SSF”) and creating the Aerospace Force (“AF”) and Cyberspace Force (“CF”).\nEvidence suggests that China regularly utilizes jamming and spoofing methods on GPS satellites to safeguard sensitive areas from drone surveillance or potential attacks. Additionally, there are reports of China targeting U.S. government satellites on a daily basis. If China gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable China might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well. China has also developed ground-based laser systems designed to dazzle the optical sensors of spy satellites as they pass over sensitive sites to temporarily prevent the satellite from taking a picture or physically damage the image sensor.\n380.

Russia\nNotwithstanding numerous declarations to the effect that space must be reserved for peaceful purposes, evidence exists that Russia continues in the militarization of space. Russian space law—largely governed by Federal Law No. 5663—stipulates that space activities must adhere to legal provisions for safeguarding state secrets, military and commercial secrets, intellectual property, and exclusive rights. This suggests that the federal law acknowledges Russia's intention to utilize space for military purposes. Despite some progress in national security space capabilities, the Russian space industry is currently grappling with an era of stagnation.\nLately, Russia has heightened its efforts in developing antisatellite systems, with some of these efforts being publicly disclosed. Additionally, Russia has been engaged in the creation of orbital maneuvering satellites, potentially for tasks related to inspection and interception. The advancement in these technologies not only hints at Russia's intention to target reconnaissance and communication satellites, but also signifies a growing unease within Russia regarding the perceived weaponization of space by others. Given Russia's long history of imperialism, reasonable doubts exist that its advocacy for peace in space might stem more from its current limited space capabilities, rather than from a genuine desire for space to remain a sanctuary. There is evidence suggesting Russia regularly uses jamming and\n386. See supra Part II(A).\n387.

If Russia gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable they might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well.\n## VII. CONCLUSION\nThis paper has delved into the issue of cyber-threats for satellites in non-Earth orbits, particularly in lunar orbits, amid escalating cyber-risks. The growing cislunar and lunar economy will heighten vulnerability, especially for commercial lunar satellites lacking robust protection. Just as Earth-orbiting satellites have faced increasing threats, lunar satellites will be confronted with similar risks in the expanding lunar economy. With a limited number of satellites orbiting the Moon, this paper has drawn insights from threats facing Earth's satellites to anticipate risks for lunar counterparts, focusing specifically on cyberthreats. Cyberthreats pose unique challenges due to attribution complexities and scope of the right of self-defense. This paper has examined cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and as armed attacks, assessing affected states' rights to self-defense. Considering provisions in the UN Charter and the OST, this paper has concluded that Article IV of the OST cannot be interpreted as impeding the right of self-defense of lunar satellites. Even if certain restrictions exist, this paper has argued that the right of self-defense would prevail when constrained by these limitations. Preserving security for both government and commercial satellites remains crucial for U.S. national interests, and it will become paramount on the Moon as well. The recognition that the right of self-defense is not diminished in space is an important component of satellite security.\n. Dong L.

CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] Regarding the remote nature of operations, space systems are particularly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats due to the remote nature of their operations. Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks;[95] if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands.[96] Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.[97] As for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging.[98] Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.[99] ## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY Satellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation.[100] Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations.[101] In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite. Considering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly."

Lunar satellites present an opportunity to implement necessary protective measures on an open canvas. ## D. THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF LUNAR SATELLITES This paper has discussed how, as the lunar economy grows, dependable navigation and communication will be crucial for both government and private lunar missions. Currently, lunar orbits remain relatively uncrowded.¹⁰⁵ However, some satellites and orbiters from previous lunar missions are still orbiting the Moon. As of July 2023, there were at least six “active lunar orbiters:”¹⁰⁶ Artemis P1 and Artemis P2 (operating “in eccentric orbits of low inclination”); NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (orbiting “the Moon in a nearly polar, slightly elliptical orbit”); Chandrayaan-2 of the Indian Space Agency and Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (both operating in “in polar orbits of 100 km altitude”); and NASA’s Capstone (having a completely different, and much higher orbit).¹⁰⁷ Additionally, two non-operative spacecrafts (the 2009 Japanese Ouna and the Indian 2008 Chandrayaan-1) currently ¹⁰².

CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] orbit the Moon.¹⁰⁸ Lunar satellites will face geophysical threats coming from the Moon's environment.¹⁰⁹ The main concern is that the Moon is not nearby enough to quickly address these issues. Therefore, planned lunar missions must be sustainable and autonomous. In regards to cybersecurity, when planning lunar missions, scientists and engineers must use various models to approximate real conditions—such as thermal environments, difficulties in communications and navigation systems, placement and maneuvering of the spacecraft, as well as generation and storage of the power. However, uncertainties, unknowns, or unforeseen circumstances on the Moon may pose hazards for lunar missions.¹¹⁰ No documented cyberthreats have targeted satellites in lunar orbits, but security breaches in space agencies have sparked worries about mission safety. NASA frequently discloses cybersecurity issues, such as unauthorized attempts to access its systems. In 2019, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported a data breach resulting from unauthorized access.¹¹¹ Though these incidents might not have caused visible harm, NASA and other government entities and organizations must always focus on safeguarding their digital assets and infrastructure. Recognizing the critical role of lunar satellites, the 2022 National Cislunar Science &amp; Technology Strategy (\"NCS&amp;T Strategy\"),¹¹² in outlining its key objectives, provided for the need to \"implement Cislunar communications and PNT capabilities with scalable and interoperable approaches\"¹¹³ and for the extension of \"space situational awareness capabilities into Cislunar space.\"¹¹⁴ The NCS&amp;T Strategy contains two specific mentions of cybersecurity, clarifying that cybersecurity is ¹⁰⁸.

For example, as addressed above, the predictability of orbits increases the propensity to attacks but; predictability of orbit is not to be considered a problem for cislunar satellites. These satellites have the opposite problem; satellite orbits tend to shift continuously¹¹⁷ unless they are positioned in proximity of Lagrange points L4 and L5.¹¹⁸ As the lunar economy advances, both government and commercial satellite operators must remain vigilant in safeguarding their assets, even if they perceive cyber-risks as unlikely. This perception of unlikelihood could pose a particular challenge for commercial actors.¹¹⁹ Conversely, governments have been concerned about cybersecurity threats since the inception of the space program.¹²⁰ The government should be proactive in safeguarding commercial systems in a space protection plan because threats to commercial actors’ lunar ¹¹⁵.

The scale and frequency of maintenance maneuvers in cislunar space, notably around the Moon, heavily rely on the level of instability inherent in the trajectory. The authors also point out that for nonmaneuvering objects, once their position control is lost, the trajectory of the object can rapidly deviate from its projected path, often by a considerable margin.

Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government.¹²² While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.¹²³ In a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon.¹²⁴ Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities.¹²⁵ Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.¹²⁶"

Highlighting the intricate nature of cyber threats and their impact on both governmental and commercial satellites, this paper examines cyberattacks as potential international wrongful acts and armed attacks. This paper evaluates the right of affected states to self-defense and scrutinizes Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty (\"OST\"), alongside other pertinent treaties' provisions. This paper concludes that Article IV of the OST should not be interpreted as to impede the right of self-defense for lunar satellites, and claims that the inherent right of self-defense overrides the OST's restrictions, allowing for protection for lunar satellite assets.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n665\n# I. INTRODUCTION\nThis paper discusses the legal issues of protecting satellites in lunar (and other non-earth) orbits from cyberattacks. Lunar satellites are included in the \"cislunar\" space¹ but present special characteristics that differentiate them from the satellites around Earth. This paper focuses on lunar satellites due to the expanding cislunar and lunar economy. This expansion is expected to result in an escalation of cyberrisks for lunar satellites—particularly for commercial ones, which have less robust protection compared to their military counterparts.² Similar to Earth-orbiting satellites³—upon which our economy has come to rely—which are facing growing threats from competitors and adversaries openly expressing their intention to disrupt these satellites in times of conflict,⁴ lunar satellites are likely to face the same threats, with the expansion of the lunar economy.⁵\nDue to the limited number of satellites currently orbiting the Moon, this paper analyses the threats faced by Earth's satellites and derives insights applicable to lunar satellites. Potential adversaries are constantly trying to capitalize on perceived weaknesses in space capabilities,⁶ and satellites are exposed to several threats (including physical/kinetic, non-kinetic/physical, electronic, and cyber); however, this paper focuses on\n1. 42 U.S.C. § 18302 (defining \"Cis-lunar space\" as \"the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon\").\n2.

Preserving the security of both governmental and commercial satellites is essential for the United States national interests.¹⁰\nThis paper will discuss in Part III(E) and Part IV, respectively, cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and cyberattacks as “armed attacks.”¹¹ In both cases, the affected state has a right to react, albeit with differing degrees of severity. Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)¹² prohibits use of force or threat thereof.¹³ Self-defense (including collective self-defense as in the North Atlantic Treaty)¹⁴ stands as an exception as per Article 51 of the UN Charter, incorporating a fundamental principle within customary international law.¹⁵ This paper examines if a cyberattack qualifies as use of force, granting affected states the right to countermeasures, and, if the cyberattack escalates to an armed attack, whether self-defense permits the use of force or threat thereof.¹⁶\nThe Preamble of the Outer Space Treaty (“OST”)¹⁷ frames exploration and use of space as an aspirational principle. However, “peaceful purposes” is not defined by the OST.¹⁸ Article IV of the OST—which is a rare instance in which the Moon and other celestial bodies are treated separately and distinct from the empty outer space—is the\n7. Erwin, supra note 4.\n8. The level of attribution varies, with the kinetic/physical attacks being the easiest to attribute, followed by the non-kinetic physical ones, with the electronic and cyber having the most difficult attribution. The issue of attribution is very challenging in cybersecurity. First, technical attribution is difficult. Second, even if technical attribution is possible, the problem of legal attribution remains.\n9. U.N.G.A.

This system aims to link lunar assets with Earth across lunar and cislunar spaces.57\nLunar activities will rely on satellites in various ways. First, for lunar communication: in order to maintain contact with assets on the lunar surface, lunar satellites will serve as communication relay stations, enabling data transfer, audio/video communication, and command and control of lunar rovers/other equipment.58 Upcoming lunar missions anticipate reliance on emerging cislunar space networks, comprising a special network for communication including relay satellites, orbiters, and spacecraft.59 With the establishment of a stable presence on the Moon, the communication need will be even more pressing. Before its Chang'e-4 mission, China positioned Queqiao, a relay satellite, into a halo orbit beyond the Moon. Its primary objective was to facilitate communication between Earth-based ground stations and the Far Side, where the Chang'e-4 lander would operate.60 To support its Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8, China launched another relay satellite, named Queqiao-2.61\nSecond, for navigation and positioning: lunar activities (including landing, navigation, mapping, and mining) will likely use satellite systems like Global Navigation Satellite System (\"GNSS\") or lunar-specific positioning systems to provide accurate location information\n56.

SELECTED EXAMPLES OF SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\nSatellite hacking has occurred on multiple occasions.⁷⁰ In 2011, the U.S. issued a report, revealing that cyber-intruders (possibly connected to Chinese military groups) had disrupted the operations of two U.S. government satellites on four separate occasions in the previous years.⁷¹ Troubling incidents of cyberattacks have happened in connection with the Ukrainian War. Immediately prior the invasion, Russia initiated a massive cyberattack against ViaSat, a satellite company, disabling and infecting all the ground modems responsible for transmitting signals to/from the satellites, rendering the systems inoperable.⁷² The attack impacted not only Ukraine (which used ViaSat for military communication) but also other Central and Eastern European nations,\n68.

Dozor-Teleport did not disclose specific attack details, and it is unclear whether the terrestrial network was affected or the satellites themselves. A self-proclaimed “hacktivist” organization and a branch of the Wagner Group both claimed responsibility, asserting that they sent malicious software to the satellite terminals.74 In 2022, Elon Musk revealed that SpaceX’s Starlink satellites had been subjected to numerous cyberattacks in the wake of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.75\n## B. WHY SATELLITES ARE PARTICULARLY EASY TARGETS FOR CYBERATTACKS\nA satellite could be attacked kinetically or non-kinetically. “Kinetic” means actions involving physical force or direct contact, such as bombings and other types of attacks that cause physical damage, while “non-kinetic” attacks are those that do not involve a direct physical force. A cyberattack—the focus of this paper—is a form of non-kinetic attack being carried out by digital means to compromise, disrupt, or damage data, infrastructure, or communication. The term “cyberattack” has several definitions, including the following: “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident or transiting these systems or networks.” Cyberattacks are performed through malware, hacking, denial-of-service, and other tactics aimed at compromising or disrupting computer systems, networks, and data. A cyberattack can aim at stealing sensitive information, or causing system malfunctions, or blocking the system (unblocking it only after the payment of a sum of money called ransomware).\nCyberattacks are not the only possible form of non-kinetic attacks. Spoofing (use of deceptive or fraudulent electronic data or communications to deceive, manipulate a system, or disguise the attacker’s\n73.

Scholars Georgeson and Stubbs explain that satellites are vulnerable due to several factors: (1) they are typically unshielded; (2) they follow predictable orbits, (3) they have limited maneuverability, (4) they are \"few enough in number\" that their destruction could have substantial repercussions; (5) replacing them is costly and consuming; and (6) numerous satellites have dual-use functionality, providing services to the military and to civilians, making them potential targets for enemy attacks.80\nNot all of the factors mentioned above are equally relevant to protection against cyberattacks. As for shielding:81 while shielding against destructive attacks like kinetic anti-satellite missiles is difficult, protection against non-kinetic attacks is feasible (e.g., to safeguard against electronic attacks, a shutter shield could protect specific sensors or satellite lids; shielding could be effective against blinding lasers or dazzlers). Shielding satellites against kinetic attacks is not only challenging but also costly, as it increases expenses not only during\n76. While different from a cyberattack, spoofing can be used in a cyberattack to trick the system into believing that the source of a cyberattack is a legitimate source. For example, in a phishing attack, attackers may use email spoofing to make an email appear as though it comes from a trusted source.

Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\ndevelopment but also during launch due to the added weight.82 Dissimilarly, protection against cyberattacks does not necessitate an increase in weight, and therefore launch costs. While development expenses are still a consideration, it is crucial for all satellite operators to create a robust cybersecurity system.\nAs for predictability of orbit and fuel scarcity: satellites follow predictable orbits,83 not only due to the laws of physics, but also because they carry limited fuel—which restricts their ability to make significant changes to their orbits. Additionally,84 technical limitations on maneuverability and fuel scarcity result in satellite operators being unable to make rapid maneuvers, even if they detect that an attack is coming.85 Cyberattacks would not be affected by predictability of orbit or limited maneuverability because cyberattacks happen in the \"cyberworld,\" where maneuverability is not necessary; only a robust cybersecurity program is essential.\nIn terms of the limited number (i.e., lack of redundancy of satellites), the landscape is swiftly evolving.86 While satellites remain relatively scarce, LEO constellations are significantly altering this scenario in many instances, making lack of redundancy somewhat less impactful. However, this is not universally applicable to every satellite type or operator. In certain instances, operators might not possess hundreds or thousands of satellites performing the same functions; they might have only a few, which play a pivotal role in providing crucial services.87 All things considered, satellites are still relatively few in number.88\n82.

Stating:\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n677\nSatellites often lack security components; Koplow contends that many satellites do not possess onboard sensors for local situational awareness, potentially leaving them unaware of any attacks or their sources. Constellations influence the replacement factor by maintaining a continuous turnover of satellites. Yet, certain operators cannot bear the expenses of development or replacement in the event of satellite destruction. Replacement is not a factor for cyberattack because the damage is generally reversible. If a satellite faces temporary impairment, its functionality could be restored provided the system is properly designed.\nIn addition to the above factors, there are factors specific to cyberattacks, such as a lack of system redundancies, the remote nature of satellite operations, and limited or outdated computer resources. Some of the satellites lack system redundancy. System redundancy involves incorporating supplementary components, resources, or elements within a satellite that are not strictly essential for its operation but are included to improve reliability, availability, fault tolerance, and overall robustness. Although redundant systems can still be susceptible to cyberattacks, redundancy could mitigate the risk because, if a component is compromised due to a cyberattack, other components might be capable of fulfilling its functions. Today satellites—at least the larger ones—are designed with redundancy in mind.\n[Satellites] are still relatively few in number (so destroying or damaging even a handful could have a major impact); they are \"soft\" (lacking heavy shielding or the ability to defend themselves from attack); they usually follow known, predictable orbital paths, with little ability to undertake evasive maneuvers (so they are easily trackable \"sitting ducks\").\nId.\n89.

Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks; if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands. Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.\nAs for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging. Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.\n## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY\nSatellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation. Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations. In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite.\nConsidering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly.\n95. Peeters, supra note 2 (arguing that \"cyber-attacks on satellites are often related to accessing the satellite system via ground stations\").\n96.

Lunar satellites present an opportunity to implement necessary protective measures on an open canvas.\n## D. THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF LUNAR SATELLITES\nThis paper has discussed how, as the lunar economy grows, dependable navigation and communication will be crucial for both government and private lunar missions.

Therefore, planned lunar missions must be sustainable and autonomous. In regards to cybersecurity, when planning lunar missions, scientists and engineers must use various models to approximate real conditions—such as thermal environments, difficulties in communications and navigation systems, placement and maneuvering of the spacecraft, as well as generation and storage of the power. However, uncertainties, unknowns, or unforeseen circumstances on the Moon may pose hazards for lunar missions.¹¹⁰\nNo documented cyberthreats have targeted satellites in lunar orbits, but security breaches in space agencies have sparked worries about mission safety. NASA frequently discloses cybersecurity issues, such as unauthorized attempts to access its systems.

Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government.¹²² While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.¹²³\nIn a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon.¹²⁴ Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities.¹²⁵ Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.¹²⁶\n121.

These include inadvertent harm during military operations, attacks stemming from misidentification or misunderstanding of commercial activities, and deliberate targeting through physical or non-physical means during conflict. It remains uncertain when or how these threats might manifest on the Moon or affect lunar satellites.¹²⁷ While it is true, as baseball player Lawrence Peter “Yogi” Berra famously remarked, that “[i]t’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future,”¹²⁸ the global geopolitical landscape currently reflects a gradual trend towards conflict.¹²⁹ While humanity should aspire for the Moon to remain a “sanctuary of peace,” it is hard to have confidence in this aspiration. Even if we remain hopeful, it is essential for the commercial lunar stakeholders to prepare and ensure the protection of their assets. The cybersecurity landscape for lunar satellites remains uncharted and continually evolving. Thus, tailoring protective measures to address the challenges that these satellites will likely encounter is paramount. Among others, the following measures are recommendable: (1) implementation of a robust encryption/secured system for data transmission and strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access;¹³⁰ (2) shielding satellites systems from radiation-induced errors or data corruption by utilizing radiation-hardened components or implementing error-correction codes;¹³¹ (3) development\nieee.org/cybersecurity-in-space (arguing that cyberthreats targeting crewed spacecraft could involve tactics like infiltrating a craft’s internal computer system with malware or ransomware through close approaches). In particular, there are four potential ways crew members, including space tourists, might be involved in these threats: as the attacker, as an attack vector, as collateral damage, or as the target.

This paper later discusses the concept of peaceful purposes¹³⁷ and argues that the prohibition of Article IV(2) of the OST does not apply to lunar orbits.¹³⁸ However, even according to the more restricted interpretation that \"peaceful\" means \"non aggressive,\" it is clear that it would be illegal to establish facilities on the Moon dedicated to hacking another state's lunar satellites. Rule 59 of the Tallinn Manual establishes the duty to respect the State of Registry's ability \"to exercise jurisdiction and control over space objects,\" and the duty to perform \"cyber operations involving outer space with due regard for the need to avoid interference\" with the space activities of others.¹³⁹\nThese rules should be strictly enforced. Consider the catastrophic impact of a cyberattack on a lunar satellite on any of the lunar applications mentioned above. For instance, the wellbeing of lunar residents is expected to be monitored and safeguarded with the assistance of lunar or Earth-based medical teams, utilizing telemedicine, including robotic procedures for surgeries. What potential catastrophic effects might result from a cyberattack that compromises these operations? How concerning would a cyberattack on food production or resource management be? Additionally, what risks would a cyberattack on the smart infrastructure controlling and maintaining lunar facilities pose? A cyberattack of this kind could easily qualify as an international wrongful act. More severe cyberattacks, such as the simultaneous targeting of all state lunar facilities, could even qualify as an \"armed attack\" by employing the scale/effect-based approach.¹⁴⁰\n136.

General Discussion Regarding Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nEven if uncertainties exist, numerous states, including the U.S., hold the view that the current international legal framework adequately governs the conduct of states in cyberspace.¹⁴¹ According to international law, a cyberattack could fall along the spectrum of international responsibility, use of force, and possibly armed attack. The boundaries between these scenarios are not always clearly defined.\nInternational responsibility comes into play when there is a violation of an obligation attributable to a state. An international wrongful act—which is a foundational principle in customary international law—causes a novel legal relationship to arise between states when there is a breach of an international obligation by one of them. In fact, the breach triggers a shift from a primary rule—which is a rule dictating state conduct—to a secondary set of rules of responsibility. Article 2 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ARSIWA”)¹⁴² defines an international wrongful act as a conduct—either action or omission—that is contrary to what a State is required to do by international law, including violations of treaties and customary international law, that is attributable to the State. When the breach is attributable to a state, it initiates a new relationship called a “secondary rule,” which evokes legal consequences for the breaching state. Articles 28–36 of ARSIWA outline the legal ramifications of an internationally wrongful act. The legal framework aims to resolve disputes peaceably without escalating to war. It encompasses the obligation of the breaching state to cease the wrongful conduct, prevent its recurrence, rectify the situation, pay damages, or give satisfaction.\nRule 14 of the Tallinn Manual (“Internationally wrongful cyber acts”)¹⁴³ provides that a state bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to a state and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation. The focus is on acts that are less severe than the use of force, but still carry international repercussions, such as the obligation to provide reparation.\n¹⁴¹ Brian J. Egan, *International Law and Stability in Cyberspace*, 35 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 169, (2017).\n¹⁴² GAOR, *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf [hereinafter ARSIWA]. While the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts formulated by the International Law Commission (“ILC”), do not possess inherent legal binding force, they do codify principles of customary international law, which are indeed binding. These principles outline guidelines regarding state responsibility.\n¹⁴³ See TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 67, and accompanying text.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n687\nAn internationally wrongful act denotes a transgression that falls short of constituting an armed assault, but imposes accountability upon the state.¹⁴⁴ Accountability exists only if an internationally wrongful act can be legally attributed to a state.¹⁴⁵ This can be shown by establishing that the state performed the cyberattack directly, the cyberattack was performed by non-state actors whose actions are attributable to the state,¹⁴⁶ or that a state offered help to another.¹⁴⁷ Legal attribution in case of non-state actors is difficult for cyberattacks on Earth, while in space it should be easier since Article VI stipulates that states bear “international responsibility for national activities in outer space,” regardless of whether these activities are conducted by governmental or non-governmental bodies. Article VI outlines principles that simplify attribution—a challenging aspect in terrestrial contexts. This is confirmed by Rule 60 of the Tallinn Manual, providing (a) that states have a duty of a state to “authorise and supervise the cyber ‘activities in outer space’ of its non-governmental entities,” and (b) that “[c]yber operations involving space objects are subject to the responsibility and liability regime of space law.” However, due to the broadly stated principles and obligations outlined in the OST and the lack specific state practices regarding claims for violating OST duties, the circumstances allowing for an internationally wrongful act concerning breaches of duties on the Moon remain uncertain.¹⁴⁸\n144. A cyberattack is not a wrongful act in several circumstances, including when it is the result of self-defense, countermeasures, and necessity. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 19 (“Circumstances precluding wrongfulness of cyber operations”).\n145. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 15 (“Attribution of cyber operations by State organs”). “Cyber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.” Id.\n146. ARSIWA Articles 4–11 outline when actions by various entities are seen as acts of a state in international law. Articles 4 and 5 encompass actions by state organs or recognized entities, including authorized individuals yielding governmental authority. Articles 6 and 7 clarify that organs provided by one state to another and actions by state entities, even when exceeding authority, are considered state acts. Articles 8 and 9 define state acts as actions under state control or exercised in the absence of official control, both qualifying as state acts. Articles 10 and 11 address actions of insurrectional movements as state acts, attributing related conduct to those states. Lastly, Article 11 specifies that conduct not directly attributed to a state may be recognized as an act of the state if acknowledged and adopted. See also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, Rule 17 (“Attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors”). “Cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control; or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own.” Id.\n147. See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 18 (“Responsibility in connection with cyber operations by other States”).\n148.

Even if these criteria are met, establishing clear attribution for cyber activities, which is often not feasible, remains an unresolved issue. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nThe affected state has the right to take countermeasures, but does not have to respond with a cyberattack.¹⁴⁹ Countermeasures need not be in kind but must not be indiscriminate; their sole purpose should encourage responsible behavior aligned with the affected state's rights.¹⁵⁰ Furthermore, the countermeasures must not violate human rights, or engage in prohibited belligerent actions, breach peremptory norms, or violate diplomatic and consular inviolability.¹⁵¹ The countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury suffered.¹⁵² and cannot breach a legal obligation owed to a third party.¹⁵³\nSome states have taken a clear position on when cyberattacks constitute an international wrongful act. For example, in 2018, the United Kingdom, declared that cyber operations targeting another state's territory, even below the use of force threshold, can breach international law. Consequently, the affected state, with clear attribution, can take non-forceful, necessary, and proportionate countermeasures directed at the offending state to restore compliance.¹⁵⁴ In 2019, Estonia adopted a similar stance, releasing a statement on countermeasures in the event of a cyberattack.¹⁵⁵ The U.S. made a similar pronouncement in 2021.¹⁵⁶ Ireland followed suit in 2023.¹⁵⁷ France took a similar stance, and went so far as to qualify cyberattacks as a possible violation of sovereignty.¹⁵⁸ Some states also provided extensive declarations regarding the legality\n149.

Ireland, for example, declared to generally follow standard practices and to recognize the legality of countermeasures when directed to compel the offending state to comply with its obligations. Ireland also stated that countermeasures do not need to mirror the original action but must be proportionate and non-forceful. Peculiar aspects of the Irish position are the stipulation that countermeasures must be of a temporary nature and the express recognition that third-party collective countermeasures are permitted (particularly in the context of violation of peremptory norms).¹⁵⁹ Therefore, Ireland directly sided with the Tallinn Manual.¹⁶⁰\n## 2. Satellite Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nWhile no recorded case of kinetic attacks on satellites exist,¹⁶¹ satellites have often been exposed to electronic and cyberattacks.¹⁶² It is worth noting that, from an international law perspective, an argument can be made that a satellite is a quasi-extension of a state's territory because of the quasi-jurisdiction principle of Article VIII of the OST.¹⁶³ Whether Article II OST¹⁶⁴ would bar satellites as a quasi-extension of a state's territory falls beyond the scope of this paper.¹⁶⁵ However, it is important to point out that Article II seems to only refer to land,¹⁶⁶ and it likely emerged from a concern about preventing the \"colonization\" of outer space.¹⁶⁷ This allows for the interpretation that the provision might not necessarily forbid considering a satellite as an extension of a state's territory. Even assuming the inability of states to claim satellites as extensions of their territory, this would not preclude the\n¹⁵⁹. See id.

This provides more than classic territorial jurisdiction and likely covers cyberattacks on the Moon.¹⁷⁰\nAlthough the number of reported cases of satellite cyberattacks is limited, satellite cybersecurity is gaining increased attention.¹⁷¹ China,¹⁷² Russia,¹⁷³ and the United States¹⁷⁴ all possess the capability to disrupt each other's satellites, space assets, and remote weapons using methods like spoofing, jamming, and dazzling.¹⁷⁵ Other countries\n168.

Interference claims typically remain undisclosed within intelligence circles and are seldom publicly confirmed. As discussed in Part II of this paper, both governments and private entities have been involved in satellite cyberattacks.

These tactics are certainly unlawful,¹⁸⁰ and, if attribution is possible,¹⁸¹ the affected state has the right to take countermeasures. Furthermore, if the tactic rises to the level of an “armed attack,” the situation could escalate to an international armed conflict.¹⁸² Spoofing, jamming, or dazzling affect satellites that are primarily used for national security or defense. Conversely, satellites with different applications, such as search and rescue satellites or civilian telecommunications, do not seem to face similar targeting.¹⁸³ Consequently, the satellite’s function, and particularly its contribution to defense or national security, appears to be a key factor in determining its susceptibility to these non-kinetic interferences.¹⁸⁴\nAffected states have never officially attributed the attacks that they suffered to a specific state.¹⁸⁵ In the absence of formally attributed attacks, there is no precedent or established examples to indicate the threshold at which these interferences would prompt a response from the affected state. It would not be correct to read the absence of a reaction as a recognition that these interferences are necessarily lawful. However, we could at least imply that states, at the moment, would seem to tolerate these minimal interferences with their military or quasi-military satellites.¹⁸⁶ If this mindset carries over to lunar activities, there is a possibility that states might also accept these minor disruptions on the Moon. However, the approach might diverge concerning satellites not involved in military or quasi-military functions, potentially resulting in a different response to their attacks. Also, the unique lunar environment is characterized by its harsh conditions, where compromising even a single satellite could lead to catastrophic consequences. Such conditions could make it challenging to quickly\n179. Dana A. Goward, *Now Hear This - ‘Misnavigation’ or Spoofing?*, U.S. NAVAL INST.

While it is legally permissible to retaliate in a similar manner, affected states are not obligated to do so.^^ The key lies in ensuring any response is proportionate.^^ Determining the nature of countermeasures hinges on what specific activities conducted on the Moon these interferences might disrupt. The type and extent of these activities will significantly shape the response strategy chosen by the affected states.

In fact, armed conflicts are governed by two distinct bodies of law.

This second body of law is also known as laws of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") or as international humanitarian law (\"IHL\").\n## A. PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

The existence of an “armed attack” is essential for justifying the use of force in self-defense, making it an integral part of the ius ad bellum. Also, when an “armed conflict” occurs, it activates for the belligerents the application of the ius in bello.¹⁹¹\nArticle 2.4 of the UN Charter¹⁹² provides that “[a]ll Members must abstain from the threat or use of force in their international relations against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This provision establishes the principle of non-aggression, rendering the use of force, threats of force, including acts of aggression and military interventions, illegal against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence. Notably, it also prohibits any use or threat of force that contradicts the United Nations’ purposes. Three instances exist where the prohibition of use of force within or against another state is lawful: (1) that state’s consent; (2) authorization from the UN Security Council; and (3) individual or collective self-defense.¹⁹³\nThis paper does not discuss the topic of states’ consent¹⁹⁴ or the UN Security Council’s authorization;¹⁹⁵ and it focuses on the right of self-defense, as specifically relevant to a reaction to a cyberattack on a satellite. Self-defense is a principle of customary international law, which is also recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter, which qualifies it as “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.”¹⁹⁶ This right exists whether exercised individually or collectively by states (as under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty).¹⁹⁷ Under the principle of self-defense, a state is allowed to employ force when confronted with an “armed attack.” Nevertheless, the pivotal issue lies in the definition of an “armed attack,” which ultimately determines the applicability of the right to self-defense.¹⁹⁸\nThe UN Charter does not provide a specific definition for the term “armed attack,” and records from the UN Charter’s drafters provide no definitive explanation of the term.¹⁹⁹ Scholars suggest that the inexplicit definition of “armed attack” may exist because the concept was thought to be self-evident. The drafters and negotiators consistently viewed aggression as the catalyst for justifiable self-defense. They\n191. Blank, supra note 189, at 250.\n192. U.N. CHARTER, supra note 12.\n193.

In an initial draft presented by the U.S. to the Five Powers (China, France, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom), it was stated that if the Security Council failed to prevent aggression and it occurred against any member state, that state had an inherent right to take necessary self-defense measures. During that era, two treaties, the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance and Solidarity and the Pact of the League of Arab States, also equated aggression with attack.²⁰⁰\nIn general, scholars consider an “armed attack” as being more severe and significant than a mere use of force indicating that an action could amount to use of force without reaching the level of an “armed attack.” The distinction between forms of force that qualifies as “armed attacks” and actions that imply the use of force, but fall short of being an “armed attack” is unclear, even if some guidance is offered by the international case law.²⁰¹ Particularly important is the Nicaragua case,²⁰² which adopts the “scale and effects” test to judge whether particular hostile actions directed at a state reach the level of an “armed attack.” The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) specified, for instance, that an event as minor as a “border incident” does not qualify as an “armed attack.”²⁰³ Along the same lines, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission²⁰⁴ determined that “geographically limited clashes” in a “remote, unmarked, and disputed border” were not enough to be considered an “armed attack.” Likewise, “localized border encounters” involving “small infantry units,” even resulting “in loss of life” are not an “armed attack.”²⁰⁵ The Nicaragua case clarified that sending regular armed forces across a border or using irregular militias generally constitutes an armed attack. However, providing weapons to rebels across borders does not meet the threshold. The physical impact of an action—including evaluation of the territorial intrusion, casualties, or significant property damage—is a key consideration. Bombardments or kinetic attacks, only qualify as “armed attacks” if\n200.

However, in the Oil Platforms case,²⁰⁶ the court ruled that “the mining of a single military vessel could be sufficient to meet the definition of an ‘armed attack.’”²⁰⁷\nAs discussed, at the United Nation San Francisco Conference of 1945, aggression was considered as the trigger for legitimate self-defense, specifically recognizing “armed attack” as a severe and separate form of aggression.²⁰⁸ For this reason, non-binding UN Resolution 3314 of the 1974 (“Definition of Aggression”)²⁰⁹ remains relevant for defining the term “armed attack.” Article I provides that “[a]ggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition.” Article II provides that “the First use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression” (unless the UN Security Council determines otherwise) while Article III goes on to list some examples of acts of aggression—like invasion, bombardment, blockade of ports, sending troops or mercenaries in another state, et cetera.²¹⁰\nThis paper will not delve any further on the general concept of “armed attack,”²¹¹ the previous discussion should adequately convey the complexity of this concept, which becomes even more challenging when applied to cyberattacks. Furthermore, imminence and immediacy are crucial; the right to use self-defense arises when an “armed attack” is ongoing or impending.

APPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF “ARMED ATTACK” TO CYBERATTACKS\nIn modern conflicts, cyberattacks can disrupt critical information assets, communications, and weapons systems. Cyberattacks can also cause political disruption by targeting finance, energy, transportation, and government services, thus creating social unrest.²¹⁴ In sum, a cyberattack can inflict damage well beyond that of a single bombardment.²¹⁵ Can a cyberattack be classified as \"an armed attack\" under the UN Charter?²¹⁶ Our discussion centers on cyberattacks existing independently of larger warfare contexts, such as the Ukrainian war.²¹⁷ The focus is on singular or multiple cyberattacks that, devoid of any other military actions, could be perceived as acts of aggression against national security.\nThe possibility for a cyberattack to rise to the level of an \"armed attack\" relevant under the UN Charter is the object of some debate. This paper takes the position that a satellite cyberattack can constitute—in\nthe sinking of an American steamboat (Caroline) used by Canadian insurgents, on orders of the British, caused a famous exchange of letters between United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British representative Lord Ashburton. *Id.* That correspondence is referred to as establishing the elements of the customary international right of self-defense. Webster wrote to Ashburton: \"Under these circumstances, and under those immediately connected with the transaction itself, it will be for her majesty's government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of national law, the destruction of the 'Caroline' is to be defended. It will be for that government to show a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" *Id.*\n²¹³. This paper does not discuss another self-defense restriction: a state invoking self-defense, must quickly inform the UN Security Council. The Council, under Chapter VII, is chiefly responsible for authorizing force in situations jeopardizing global peace, making decisions to maintain or restore it, potentially endorsing force if needed.\n²¹⁴.

Cyber warfare involves cyberattacks targeting nations, causing potential harm to critical infrastructure and even loss of life. However, defining what qualifies as cyber warfare remains a subject of debate among cybersecurity experts, with some suggesting it includes attacks that can result in fatalities.

According to several scholars, cyberattacks can rise to the level of “armed attacks” as the UN Charter’s regulation regarding the use of force can be expanded to encompass cyberattacks conducted by one state against another through interpretative means. Several states share this position. For example, the United Kingdom asserted that, under specific circumstances, a cyberattack can be considered the equivalent of an “armed attack” triggering the right of self-defense. Ireland has adopted the “scale and effect” test, stating that use of force “may include instances where a cyber-operation does not cause physical damages such as where there is significant impairment of functionality of critical infrastructure.” “The circumstances under which non-injurious and non-destructive cyber operations might reach the use of force threshold remains a point of uncertainty among States.” However, only in “exceptional circumstances” could a cyber operation “reach this threshold.”²¹⁸ France asserted that the threshold for the use of force in cyberspace is not solely determined by the digital tools employed, but by the impact of the cyber operation itself. If the effects of a cyber operation resemble those of traditional weaponry, it breaches the prohibition on using force between states.²¹⁹ France acknowledges that even without physical consequences, a cyber operation could qualify as a use of force, in case of severe economic cyber impacts.²²⁰ France also declared the need to evaluate several criteria, including the operation’s origin, instigator’s nature, intrusion level, intended effects, and target, determines this assessment.²²¹ Singapore proclaimed that the factors to consider are several, including the context during the cyber operation, its origin, the intended or actual impact, the level of intrusion, and the characteristics of the target.²²² Singapore and Norway also recognized the possibility of severe economic cyber impacts being seen as an “armed attack.”²²³\nBeyond general views expressed on the topic as discussed above, there are no official statements from states regarding specific instances of cyberattacks. Consequently, experts have sought to bridge this gap in state practice by offering their insights on how international law applies in this domain.²²⁴ Particularly authoritative in this debate is\n218.

SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE\nSpace has not seen direct armed conflict yet, but, unfortunately, it may be only a matter of time. As the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report put it:\nWe know from history that every medium—air, land and sea—has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different. Given this virtual certainty, the U.S. must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space. This will require superior space capabilities.²²⁹\nCurrently, “despite international efforts to stem . . . militarization, outer space is now seen by some as a viable theater of future warfare,\nnature of the connection, if any, between the cyber activity and the particular armed conflict in question”).

While it would seem generally accepted that, akin to physical conflicts, nations possess an inherent right to self-defense in the event of cyberattacks, the boundary of this right remains uncertain in international law, especially on whether the use of force is justified in response to a cyberattack.²³²\n1. Rule 51 (Self-defence against armed attack) Application to Cyberattacks\nWhile Article 51 UN Charter broadly encompasses various forms of attacks, including cyberattacks, the Tallinn Manual appropriately clarifies that a state targeted by a cyberattack maintains the right to self-defense. Rule 71 (“Self-defence against armed attack”) provides: “A State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”²³³ Some states have taken a stance on the right of self-defense in the case of cyberattacks. In 2018, the United Kingdom released the following statement: “It is clear that cyber operations that result in, or present an imminent threat of, death and destruction on an equivalent scale to an armed attack will give rise to an inherent right to take action in self-defence, as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.”²³⁴ The United Kingdom firmly believes that cyber operations leading to, or posing an immediate risk of, severe harm or destruction comparable to an “armed attack” warrant the inherent right to respond in self-defense, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.²³⁵ Canada also recognizes “that the inherent right of self-defence if an ‘armed attack’ occurs against a state also applies in cyberspace.”²³⁶\n230.

Id.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n701\nSame is true for Ireland, which rejects the need for physical damage, suggesting that severe disruption to Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”) systems could warrant a response similar to a conventional attack.²³⁷\nEstablishing attribution in case of a cyberattack that raises to the level of an armed attack is just as difficult as it in case of a cyberattack that does not raise to the level of an armed attack, as we discussed above.²³⁸ Technical attribution is difficult because a cyberattack can be launched from anywhere and perpetrators are often able to conceal their identity, and equally difficult is the attribution to a particular country.²³⁹ However, because in an armed conflict “cyberattacks frequently accompany and facilitate conventional attacks, attribution is less problematic when an armed conflict is already undergoing.”²⁴⁰\nThis paper discussed how self-defense requires imminence and immediacy, i.e. application of the Caroline Test.²⁴¹ Self-defense in case of a cyberattack is no exception. Rule 73 (“Imminence and immediacy”) of the Tallinn Manual provides, “[t]he right to use force in self-defense arises if a cyber armed attack occurs or is imminent. It is further subject to a requirement of immediacy.”²⁴² This paper also discussed how proportionality and necessity are also an issue in self-defense.²⁴³ Just as with a physical attack, the response of a targeted state to a cyberattack must align with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, the state is allowed only to take actions necessary to halt the attack or prevent additional ones. Rule 72 (“Necessity and proportionality”) of the Tallinn Manual provides “[a] use of force involving cyber operations undertaken by a State in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate.”²⁴⁴\nAs the scope of a legitimate self-defense in cyberspace is debatable, afflicted countries are generally cautious when responding to cyberattacks due to the potential for escalation. Typically, diplomatic avenues are prioritized over immediate military or cyber counterattacks in retaliation.

Ius in Bello and Its Application to Satellite Cyberattacks\nThe *ius in bello* governs the conduct of the hostilities, and has evolved over centuries. The *jus in bello* includes the laws of armed conflict (“LOAC”), alternatively known as international humanitarian law (“IHL”).²⁴⁶ This paper takes the position that IHL applies to conflicts in outer space,²⁴⁷ considering that the ICJ held that the IHL “applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future.”²⁴⁸ Consistent is the Tallinn Manual, which unambiguously provides that “[c]yber operations executed in the context of an armed conflict are subject to the law of armed conflict.”²⁴⁹ However, contrary opinions exist.²⁵⁰ There is limited discourse on applying IHL to satellites in lunar or other celestial bodies’ orbits, which is not surprising considering the early stage of the lunar economy and the presence of only a few satellites around the Moon. However, once the principle of IHL applying in outer space is accepted, there is no reason to restrict IHL application to Earth’s orbits.\nThis paper only briefly outlines IHL principles and examines their application in space, specifically focusing on satellites. The following discussion will briefly cover: (1) military necessity; (2) distinction; (3) proportionality; (4) precautions; (5) the principle of constant care; and (6) the principle of avoiding widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment. Military necessity mandates that any action in an international armed conflict must be justified as necessary to gain a clear military advantage.²⁵¹ Distinction requires a clear differentiation between civilians and combatants, as well as civilian and military objectives with operations directed solely at military objects.²⁵² Military objectives are those contributing to military action through their nature, location, purpose, or use, and when their (partial or total) destruction, capture, or neutralization provides a clear military advantage.²⁵³ Rule 93 of the Tallinn Manual clarifies that\n246.

Scholars note that sometimes the purpose of a space object is unclear, and a civilian or commercial space object can be easily converted to military use by reprogramming it to handle military data.²⁵⁸ Regarding the \"definitive military advantage\" requirement, the challenge in space arises from the potential for shifting object locations, changing ownership, or altered circumstances that may render the destruction of a space object no longer providing a clear military advantage.²⁵⁹ Complications arise from the dual-use nature of many space objects, serving both military and civilian roles (like the GPS system). Dual-use objects²⁶⁰ are considered military targets under the principle of distinction.²⁶¹ However,\n254. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 93 (\"Distinction\").\n255. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 99 (\"Prohibition of attacking civilian objects\").

Military objectives are objects that, due to their nature, location, purpose, or use, significantly contribute to military actions and their destruction, capture, or neutralization at the time provides a clear military advantage. Cyber infrastructure can potentially be categorized as a military objective. Id.\n256. Georgeson &amp; Stubbs, supra note 80, at 615.\n257. Id. (internal citation omitted).\n258. Id. at 616.\n259.

Among the countries that utilized dual-use satellites is Russia. See generally Zak, supra note 175 (mentioning that the line between civilian and military use of most Russian orbital assets is often unclear). Applications like communications, navigation, remote sensing, and weather forecasting are crucial for both sectors. These assets can be considered dual-use since government-controlled entities use them for various purposes. Id. at 4. The same author, on the other hand, notes that \"Russia operates a fleet of communications satellites dedicated exclusively to the military\" Id. at 23.

This is consistent with the provision of the Tallinn Manual in point of cyber infrastructure. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 101 (\"Objects used for civilian and military purposes\"). \"Cyber infrastructure used for both civilian and military purposes is a military objective.\" Id. Rule 112 (\"Clearly separated and distinct military objectives\") is also significant, providing that \"[a] cyber attack that treats as a single target a number of clearly discrete cyber military objectives in cyber infrastructure primarily used for\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nevaluating whether those objects can be disrupted requires weighing other principles like proportionality, precautions, and ongoing care.²⁶² Proportionality dictates that an attack should not result in excessive collateral damage to civilians or non-military objects, in relation to the expected, specific, and direct military advantage.²⁶³ The assessment necessitates weighing projected civilian losses against military gains, taking into account all available information.²⁶⁴\nRule 113 of the Tallinn Manual dictates the prohibition to perform a “cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²⁶⁵ When a satellite is dual-use, proportionality is a significant concern because an attack on such a system could result in substantial civilian impact, making proportionality a potential barrier to attacking those objects.²⁶⁶ Precautions mandate attackers to exercise caution in their choice of attack methods, and presents a significant obstacle to targeting space objects, particularly due to the potential creation of space debris—a likely outcome if we are talking of kinetic attacks.²⁶⁷ Scholars suggest that a kinetic attack on a ground station might be the preferred method to achieve a clear military advantage while adhering to the principle of precautions. Rule 121 of the Tallinn Manual mandates the implementation of precautions as well.²⁶⁸\nSatellite cyberattacks could be a viable option under the principle of precautions as it can blind satellites without generating debris.²⁶⁹ The principle of constant care (“requiring that constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians, and civilian objects”) requires evaluation of the impact on civilians, even when they are not in close proximity. This affects the proportionality balance.²⁷⁰ Rule 114 of the Tallinn Manual dictates that “during hostilities involving\ncivilian purposes is prohibited if to do so would harm protected persons or objects.” Id. at Rule 112 (“Clearly separated and distinct military objectives”).\n262.

However, some consider its application to space a logical conclusion.²⁷² If this principle applies to space, it discourages kinetic satellite destruction due to the debris. Attackers might prefer terrestrial or non-kinetic methods like cyberattacks. The Tallinn Manual contains specific provisions for the protection of important installations, of “objects indispensable to survival,” and of the natural environment in general.²⁷³\nThis paper does not discuss international human rights law (IHRL), which in certain cases (states’ exercising power or control) could extend beyond a state’s territory, potentially reaching outer space where no sovereignty exists.²⁷⁴ Though not the main focus, IHRL factors like necessity, proportionality, precautions, and investigations are likely to impact decisions on satellite attacks, including cyberattacks.²⁷⁵ Applying IHRL to space raises concerns about potential violations of the right to life if individuals are killed through satellite targeting.²⁷⁶\nIn conclusion, satellite cyberattacks generally adhere to most IHL principles, except potentially the principle of proportionality.²⁷⁷ The significant repercussions of destroying certain satellites, like the GPS system, may pose challenges due to their impact on the broader civilian population, potentially violating the principle of proportionality. When considering cyberattacks on lunar satellites, several critical factors come into play. The vast distance to the Moon necessitates autonomous operations, making immediate human intervention improbable.\n271. TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 67, at Rule 114 (“Constant Care”).\n272.

The implications of an attack on lunar satellites might not align with IHL principles, particularly concerning proportionality, as the magnitude of possible outcomes would far exceed acceptable limits, potentially causing indiscriminate harm. This raises concerns about the compatibility of such actions with the established framework of IHL. Furthermore, the growing lunar economy and increased human presence on the Moon will magnify the significance of IHRL concerns. As the utilization of lunar resources expands and human activities on the Moon increase, IHRL considerations are likely to emerge as pressing issues that need careful examination.\n## V. THE OUTER SPACE TREATY AND THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES VIS-À-VIS SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n## A. THE OST PROVISIONS RELEVANT FOR SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\n### 1. Articles II, III, VIII, and IX of the OST\nThis paper examines now the regulations governing outer space, primarily outlined in the OST, which apply during both peacetime and wartime.²⁷⁸ Thus, it is a crucial consideration when addressing cyberthreats to satellites. However, this paper takes the position that the principles of *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* are “the *lex specialis* during armed conflict and prevail over the general law of outer space.”²⁷⁹ Several provisions potentially impact the issue of cyberattacks on lunar satellites. First, Article II of the OST, which likely aimed at preventing the “colonization” of outer space,²⁸⁰ and which specifies, “[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”²⁸¹ The prevailing view asserts that this non-appropriation principle applies to both States and private\n²⁷⁸.

II.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n707\nactors,²⁸² despite some influential scholars historically advocating the opposite stance.²⁸³ While states cannot claim territory on the Moon, this does not rule out that a cyberattack on a lunar satellite could be considered an internationally wrongful act²⁸⁴ or could rise to the level of an “armed attack.”²⁸⁵\nSecond, Article III of the OST, which mandates that states conduct activities in line with international law—including the UN Charter—and aims to uphold international peace, security, cooperation, and understanding.²⁸⁶ As a result of this provision, the use of force and its threat are forbidden under Article 2.4 of the UN Charter, except as permitted by Article 51 (pertaining to self-defense) and decisions of the UN Security Council.²⁸⁷\nThird, Article VIII OST,²⁸⁸ which stipulates that a state retains jurisdiction and control over an object launched into outer space under its registry.²⁸⁹ This registration implies authority over the registered object.²⁹⁰ Consequently, a satellite circling the Moon falls under the jurisdiction of the state that officially registered it. This provision establishes a form of jurisdiction similar to the concept of a “flag” state, resembling territorial control over the registered space object\n282. See, e.g., Ricky J. Lee, Article II of the Outer Space Treaty: Prohibition of State Sovereignty, Private Property Rights, or Both, 11 AUSTL. INT’L L.J. 128, 129 (2004) (highlighting how the prohibition must include private entities: because per Article VI, “any act of national appropriation by private entities would be subject to the direction or influence of the State”).\n283. See, e.g., Stephen Gorove, Interpreting Article II of the Outer Space Treaty, 37 FORDHAM L. REV. 349 (1969).

COLOGNE COMMENTARY ON SPACE LAW: Vol. I 65 (Stephan Hobe et al., eds., Carl Heymanns Verlag 2009) [hereinafter COLOGNE COMMENTARY I].\nA major imperative for declaring international law, including the UN charter, applicable to outer space, was the overriding concern for the maintenance of international peace and security, which, after all, is the primary purpose and responsibility of the United Nations (UN) and the fear for an arms race in outer space. Thus, generally accepted rules and principles, such as the prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defense, would also be in force in outer space. Id. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n288. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n289.

SPACE L. 323, 328 (2014).\nThe registry of a space object has the same legal consequences as registering a ship or an aircraft. The only difference is that in Space Law, inclusion in the national registry does not confer nationality de jure to the spacecraft, only jurisdiction and control thereon. However, in practice such inclusion entitles the State of registry to exercise its sovereignty over the registered object. This amounts to a quasi-nationality or nationality de facto of the space object.\nId.\n290. Id.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nakin to an airplane flagged with a particular state.²⁹¹ Notably, Article VIII applies solely to “launched” objects, excluding items constructed in space. Therefore, it will not be applicable to satellites constructed directly in lunar orbits.\nFourth, Article IX:²⁹² this paper will only briefly mention the principle of due regard. “In the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty . . . shall conduct all their activities in outer space . . . with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty.”²⁹³ Due regard, akin to a primary “duty of care,”²⁹⁴ stands as a potential mechanism for international responsibility regarding wrongful acts. For example, if State A (or one of its nationals) conducts a cyberattack on a lunar satellites of State B (or one of its nationals), State A would not show proper consideration for the activity of State B. This would violate the obligation of due regard, activating the secondary rule of responsibility previously addressed.²⁹⁵ The exact scope of due regard remains unclear as this provision has never been used, resulting in a dearth of established State practices. In practice, State parties seem hesitant or unwilling to directly acknowledge the concept of “due regard.”²⁹⁶\n## 2. Article IV(1) of the OST\nThe only substantive provision of the OST dealing with military use is Article IV, which (1) prohibits placing in orbit/installing/stationing (as opposed to transiting) nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction in space; (2) requires using the Moon and other celestial bodies (but not empty space) “exclusively for peaceful purposes”;²⁹⁷ and\n291. Id.\n292. OST, supra note 17, at Art. IX. Among other deliberate omissions, this paper does not discuss the harmful interference principal also established by Article IX OST. The harmful interference principle provides that States can engage in international consultations if their space-related activities foreseeably interfere with other nations’ endeavors. Similarly, a State can request consultations if it believes another country’s space actions might disrupt peaceful space exploration. While this clause has potential relevance for lunar satellites, this paper does not discuss it because, for the way in which Article IX is framed, the provision would seem to refer to involuntary interference and not a cyberattack.\n293. Id.\n294. Michael J.

See supra Part III(A).\n296. Listner, The Paradox of Article IX, supra note 294, at 28 (discussing States’ reluctance to resort to Article IX OST).\n297. Member states have interpreted “peaceful” as “non-aggressive” not as “nonmilitary.” See, e.g., Fabio Tronchetti, *Legal aspects of the military uses of outer space*, in *HANDBOOK OF SPACE LAW* (Frans von der Dunk, ed., Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015), at 331–81.\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n709\n(3) prohibits using celestial bodies for military bases, for weapon testing, and for military maneuvers.\nWhile more specific than other provisions of the OST, Article IV uses general language and lacks crucial definitions, especially as it pertains to terms such as \"weapons of mass destructions,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"military.\"298 Article IV(1) establishes a ban on certain types of weapons in space (\"nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\"), which cannot be placed \"in orbit around the earth,\" installed \"on celestial bodies,\" \"or stationed in outer space in any other manner.\"299 It does not impose restrictions on non-weapons of mass destruction.300\nArticle IV(1) of the OST has no bearing on the capacity to protect lunar satellites against cyberattacks. In fact, neither nuclear weapons nor weapons of mass destruction are requisite for deterring cyberattacks on lunar satellites. Not only are these weapons unnecessary, but they would also run counter to the principle of proportionality, which governs both the employment of countermeasures for international wrongful acts and the lawful response to \"armed attacks\" in self-defense.\n## 3. Article IV(2) of the OST\nArticle IV(2) of the OST provides that \"the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes\" and bans \"[t]he establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies.\" It provides two exceptions to this overarching prohibition: (1) \"[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,\" and (2) \"[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.\"\nArticle IV(2) of the OST could potentially impact the capacity for deterrence and defense against cyberattacks if it were deemed applicable to orbital regions—a stance this paper does not support—as elucidated below. Before delving into the rationale for this position, let us assess the implications of Article IV(2) of the OST within the specific\n298. COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 71 (arguing that the article lacks definitions that could clarify terms such as \"military uses of space weapon\" and \"peaceful uses,\" preventing a clear differentiation between \"peaceful\" and \"exclusively peaceful\").\n299. OST, supra note 17, at Art. IV(1).\n300. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OFF. GEN.

In providing that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used . . . exclusively for peaceful purposes,” the provision would seem to exclude the possibility to militarily defend the assets. Even assuming that this provision does indeed pertain to orbital regions, this provision should not be construed as limiting the right of self-defense. First, the right of self-defense is a well-established norm of customary international law, solidified in Article 51 UN Charter. Its significance and authority are unlikely to be susceptible to influence by a provision framed in such broadly general terms as Article IV(2). Therefore, the right of self-defense must exist in outer space (contrary views exist).³⁰¹ Second, in case of an armed conflict, ius ad bellum and ius in bello are lex specialix that prevail the OST. Article 103 of the UN Charter provides that in cases where members of the United Nations have conflicting obligations under the current Charter and other international agreements, the obligations under the UN Charter shall prevail.³⁰² Third, the term “peaceful” under Article IV(2) should be interpreted as “non-aggressive” and not “as non-military.”³⁰³ The term “peaceful” also appears in the Preamble, Article IX, and Article XI. However, it is only in Article IV(2) that the term “peaceful” is paired with “exclusively,” creating a distinct regulatory emphasis on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Some scholars have pointed out that this is significant to give a special regime to the Moon and other celestial bodies, no matter how the term “peaceful” is interpreted within the OST, the crucial point lies in how Article IV(2) combines it with the term “exclusively.”³⁰⁴\n301. This contrary view states that self-defense on celestial bodies is limited by Article IV OST. See, e.g., Arjen Vermeer, The Laws of War in Outer Space: Some Legal Implications for the Jus ad Bellum and the Jus in Bello of the Militarisation and Weaponisation of Outer Space, in THE NEW ORDER OF WAR (2010) at 6 (arguing that “Article IV OST precludes offensive and defensive military activity on celestial bodies”). See also Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 354 (citing authorities that question the applicability of the right of self-defense in outer space).\n302. While Article 103 talks of “obligations” and not “rights” under the convention, because Article 51 is complementary to Article 2.4 (ban on use of force and threat thereof), Article 103 should be read as to make Article 51 prevail over inconsistent provisions, too. Different interpretations are possible.\n303. See, e.g., Matthew G. Looper, International Space Law: How Russia and the U.S. are at Odds in the Final Frontier, 18 S.C. J. INT’L. L. &amp; BUS. 111, 113 (2022) (“Looper, International Space Law”).

Contrary view exists. See, e.g., Vermeer supra note 301.\n304. Tronchetti, supra note 297 at 340 (arguing that the combination of these terms holds significance, as the provision specifies that the moon and other celestial bodies should be utilized “exclusively for peaceful purposes only,” not “exclusively peaceful purposes”). This wording clarifies that any activity remains lawful as long as it maintains peaceful intent; however, once non-peaceful aspects are introduced, its legality is forfeited. In essence, the moon and other celestial bodies are intended to remain devoid of any military utilization. Id. See also, Marko G. Markoff, Disarmament and Peaceful\n2024]\nCYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n711\nThis paper takes a different perspective. Although interpreting Article IV(2) in accordance with established interpretation principles necessitates considering the adverb \"exclusively,\" the presence of the adverb \"exclusively\" does not alter the fact that the UN Charter (and the inherent right of self-defense) takes precedence over the OST. In addition, \"peaceful\" should be interpreted as \"non-agressive\" and state practice reflects this interpretation. Since the 1950s, space has been utilized for military purposes, carrying a national security implication. Space was initially employed for reconnaissance and then predominantly in a passive capacity during the Cold War. During the Cold War, space was also used for nuclear capability assessments and as national technical means for verification of the non-proliferation treaties. In sum, the military usage of space gradually broadened. Overall, the utilization of space for military purposes expanded over time. It was with the Gulf War in the 1990s, often termed the inaugural \"space war,\" that space assets were actively employed for military operations within a theater of war.\nAlso, the second part of Article IV(2) poses no hindrance to the deterrence and defense of lunar satellites. It explicitly prohibits the utilization of celestial bodies for military bases, weapon testing, and military maneuvers. Arguably, deterrence and protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks are unlikely to necessitate the establishment\nPurposes Provisions in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, Spring 1976, Number 1, at 3, 16 (internal quotation omitted) (arguing that \"this use . . . excludes all kinds of military, and not only warlike activities on planets other than the Earth\"); Bin Cheng, Properly Speaking, Only Celestial Bodies Have Been Reserved for Use Exclusively for Peaceful (Non-Military) Purposes, but Not Outer Void Space, 75 INT'L. L. STU. 81 (2000).\n305. The advocates for the theory that the presence of the adverb \"exclusively\" would mean complete demilitarization of the Moon, also point out to the Antarctica treaty that contains that same language and is \"commonly understood as meaning a complete demilitarization of Antarctica.\" See, e.g., COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287 at 82.\n306.

Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War is commonly cited as the inaugural \"space war\" because of the extensive utilization of space-based capabilities throughout the conflict. The effective deployment of space technologies by the United States military, notably the Global Positioning System (\"GPS\"), played a pivotal role in earning this distinction.

However, if that were the case, the two explicitly stated exceptions to this provision would come into play. As mentioned, these exceptions are as follows: (1) “[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,” and (2) “[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.” Either of these exceptions provides ample flexibility to permit deterrence and protection of lunar satellites. In fact, the satellites slated for deployment around the Moon, at least initially, will serve “scientific research or other peaceful purposes,” such as experiments and enabling lunar mining. An argument can be constructed, therefore, that the deployment of “military personnel” essential for deterring and defending these satellites should fall under this exception. Additionally, under the second exception, the use of any equipment or facility necessary for deterring attacks on and safeguarding these satellites should also be permissible, even if generally prohibited by the overarching provision of the latter part of Article IV(2) because at least initially the lunar satellites will be “necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon.”\nFurthermore, this paper argues that Article IV(2) exclusively applies to the Moon and celestial bodies themselves and does not encompass lunar orbits (as well as the orbits of other planets). Lunar orbits and similar regions can be arguably considered part of empty outer space, exclusively covered by Article IV(1). Consequently, if the need for military defense against cyberattacks on lunar satellites were to arise, it would be legal to station military personnel and equipment in the vicinity of the Moon or lunar orbit (as opposed to the lunar surface). There are several reasons why Article IV(2) does not extend to these orbits. First, the general principle is that Article I of the OST's freedom of use applies to \"empty outer space,\" while the regulation of celestial bodies is the exception. Given that Article IV(2) contains an exception to a general principle, it should be narrowly construed. Second, at least some orbits (i.e., Earth's orbit) have been used \"militarily\" since the inception of the space age, and no state has significantly objected to that use. Therefore, state practice supports the argument that orbits are empty outer space and are not covered by Article IV(2). According to Article 31.3(b) of the Vienna Convention on\n310. See, e.g., COLOGNE COMMENTARY I, supra note 287, at 81–82 (making the argument that outer space is not covered by Article IV(2)).\n311. Cheng, supra note 304, at 81.\n312. Military utilization of Earth's orbits traces its origins to the 1950s.

Given that an expansive interpretation of Article IV(2) would pose a substantial obstacle to the exercise of the right of self-defense (in essence, potentially hindering any military protection of lunar installations), it is advisable not to construe Article IV(2) broadly to encompass lunar orbits. Fourth, the Moon Agreement, which holds limited direct significance today, can serve as a valuable tool when used ex contrario to offer insights for interpreting the OST.314 This approach suggests that if the Moon Agreement addresses a particular issue, it may indicate that the OST does not encompass that specific aspect. This is notably applicable to Article 1(2) of the Moon Agreement, which explicitly includes \"orbits around or other trajectories to or around it\" in the Moon's definition, and Article 3 of the Moon Agreement, which provides a more detailed framework for regulating military activities on the Moon.315 Extending the Moon's governance structure to lunar orbit based on the\n313. See United Nations, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 23 May 1969, 1155 TREATY SERIES 331, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf.\n314. Different opinions exist. See, e.g., Michael Listner, The Moon Treaty: failed international law or waiting in the shadows?, THE SPACE REV. (Oct. 24, 2011), https://www.thespacereview.com/article/1954/1 [hereinafter Listner, The Moon Treaty] (\"arguing that although only a few nations ratified the Moon Treaty, the participation of countries like Australia, France, and India as signatories create \"a shadow of customary law which could grow\" so that non-parties may be influenced by the Moon Treaty's shadow if they do not challenge its legitimacy\").\n315. Article 3 of the Moon Agreement provides:\n1. The moon shall be used by all States Parties exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n2. Any threat or use of force or any other hostile act or threat of hostile act on the moon is prohibited. It is likewise prohibited to use the moon in order to commit any such act or to engage in any such threat in relation to the earth, the moon, spacecraft, the personnel of spacecraft or man-made space objects.\n3. States Parties shall not place in orbit around or other trajectory to or around the moon objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction or place or use such weapons on or in the moon.\n4. The establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military maneuvers on the moon shall be forbidden. The use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited. The use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration and use of the moon shall also not be prohibited.\n18 I.L.M. 1434, Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, (Dec. 5, 1979).

However, this argument is less compelling compared to the opposing view supported by the reasons mentioned earlier.\n## B. THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE ARRANGEMENTS\n### 1. The Other Space Treaties\nAfter the OST was enacted in 1967, several other significant treaties were signed between 1968 and 1976. These treaties, namely the Rescue Agreement,³¹⁶ Liability Convention,³¹⁷ and Registration Convention,³¹⁸ also pertain to Moon activities and Moon satellites. None of these treaties are highly pertinent to the subject of this paper, except for the Liability Convention, which could be relevant if a cyber-attack results in measurable damage for which the victim-state seeks compensation.\nIn 1979—the Moon Agreement was signed³¹⁹—and it could have had the potential to significantly influence the subject of this paper. However, this treaty ultimately failed due to the limited number of ratifications. Therefore, while differing opinions exist,³²⁰ this paper contends that the dismissal of the Moon Agreement by the vast majority of states³²¹ (including all major space-faring nations except India and Australia) renders it largely irrelevant for our analysis. However, as previously discussed, it can still serve a purpose when employed in a contrasting manner to enhance our understanding of the interpretation of OST. In other words, if the Moon Agreement found it necessary to address a particular issue, it implies that the OST does not cover that aspect.\n### 2. The Artemis Accords\nThe Artemis Accords³²² intend to create a shared framework of principles to guide the responsible execution of missions falling under\n³¹⁶.

The Artemis Accords are firmly rooted in the OST and emerged as a response to the need for a clearer framework for space activities.³²⁴ While they do not specifically address the defense of lunar satellites (or any other lunar assets), they emphasize cooperation, transparency, and sustainability.³²⁵\nTwo provisions are particularly important for the topic of this paper. Section 5 (“Interoperability”) provides that the Signatories acknowledge that the use of compatible and shared exploration infrastructure and standards (including standard for communication systems) advances exploration, scientific research, and commercial utilization. Therefore the Signatories commit to strive to employ existing interoperability standards, or to create new standards when current ones are absent or insufficient. Interoperability enhances cybersecurity³²⁶ and therefore, by providing this commitment, the Artemis Accords significantly increase protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks. Section 11 (“Deconfliction of Space Activities”), and in particular, Sections 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 are relevant. First, in Section 11.1, the Signatories reconfirm their commitment to the OST with alignment on provisions such as due regard and prevention of harmful interference. Second, in Section 11.3 the Signatories reaffirm the commitment to use due regard, as per Article IX of the OST. Section 11.3 also provides that if a Signatory fears or has suffered harmful interference, that Signatory can initiate a consultation with the other Signatory that authorized the activity (or any party to the OST). Lastly, Section 11.4 commits the Signatories to avoid deliberate actions that could lead to harmful interference with each other’s utilization of outer space. The impact of the above principles on cybersecurity for lunar satellites is undeniable.\ncooperation%20on%20Artemis %20is,of%20the%20 Outer%20Space%20Treaty (last visited Oct 28, 2023).\n³²³.

DEFENDING MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITES\n## A. UNITED STATES' SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY AND DEFENSE\nWhile the attitude of the U.S. towards space exploration and use is peaceful,³²⁷ the United States has repeatedly reaffirmed its right to take countermeasures, its right of self-defense, and its intention to use these rights in case its space activities are threatened.³²⁸ For years, the U.S. has recognized the vulnerability of space objects to both physical attacks and cyberattacks. Already in 2001, the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report pointed out that “with the growing commercial and national security use of space, U.S. assets in space and on the ground offer just such targets. The U.S. is an attractive candidate for a ‘Space Pearl Harbor.’”³²⁹ The concept of space as a domain at risk is repeated in many documents of military doctrine:\n[I]n the contested, congested, and competitive space warfighting domain, our potential adversaries continue to develop, test, and proliferate sophisticated weapons. These weapons have the potential to be the most severe risks to orbital flight. To minimize this risk, it is imperative we execute threat-focused space operations that are fully integrated with timely and relevant intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.³³⁰\nPresident Obama’s National Space Policy³³¹ (“2010 NSP”) emphasizes the safeguarding of space assets mentioning the following necessities: (1) to ensure cost-effective resilience of space capabilities based on their planned use, potential consequences of capability loss, threat levels, and the availability of alternative means to fulfill missions; and (2) to develop and employ strategies and capabilities for the safeguard of critical national security space-dependent missions, including rapid asset restoration and leveraging diverse resources for mission execution.³³² The 2010 NSP suggests proliferation of space capabilities as\n³²⁷. 51 U.S.C. § 20102 (“Congressional declaration of policy and purpose”) provides that “Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.” *Id.*\n³²⁸.

If deterrence fails, the right to self-defense is invoked in accordance with international law and treaty obligations. The 2011 NSSS specified that, although the U.S. believes that all space-faring nations should strive to prevent space hostilities, it acknowledges that some actors might still see military advantage in space-based actions. In 2018, the Trump Administration issued the U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy, and instituted the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency. Specifically on cybersecurity for space, the Trump Administration issued Space Policy Directive 5 - Cybersecurity Principles for Space System (\"SPD-5\"), which focused on cybersecurity for space systems and urged federal agencies and non-governmental space operators to establish cybersecurity norms.\nIn 2020, the National Space Policy (\"2020 NSP\") reaffirmed the right of self-defense providing that if any adversary jeopardizes the advantages that the U.S. gains from space, the U.S. will use all means to deter and, if needed, overcome hostile actions in space. The U.S. will continue to use space for national security, including the right of self-defense, as unfettered access and operational freedom in space\n333.

The U.S. will seek to deter that threat, but if unsuccessful will respond appropriately, and not necessarily in kind.\nThe 2020 NSP emphasizes the U.S.' intention of developing plans and capabilities to counter any interference or attack on U.S. or allied space systems, especially those vital for critical infrastructure, enabling a responsive approach as determined by the U.S.³⁴³ The 2020 NSP highlights that the U.S. aims for a secure, stable, and open space environment. It also recognizes that the space domain has evolved into a \"warfighting domain\" due to the actions of competitors.³⁴⁴ Noting the critical importance of space security for both U.S. and global stability, the 2020 NSP outlines the need for the U.S. to enhance its security systems, policies, and strategies to safeguard its space interests, dictating specific principles.³⁴⁵ The 2020 NSP designates Space Force as the main military branch for space, with the responsibility to organize, train, and equip forces to protect national interests in space and ensure access to space. Space Force will also supply forces for offensive, defensive, and support operations to U.S. Space Command and other commands.³⁴⁶ The Secretary of Defense is tasked with protecting the use of space for U.S. national security, economic interests, and those of allies and partners.³⁴⁷ The 2020 NSP also places significant emphasis on cybersecurity, committing to integrate it into all aspects of the space\n340.

For the purpose of this paper, Pillar Two is the most important because it: (1) outlines the U.S. strategy to employ all available means (including diplomacy, information, finance, intelligence, and law enforcement) to deter potential attackers from jeopardizing U.S. interests, and to halt malicious actors from conducting extended cyber-campaigns that are a threat to national security and public safety; (2) expresses the U.S.' intention to execute continuous and precisely targeted \"disruption campaigns\" to dissuade cybercriminals from engaging in cyber-activities (including by making those activities unprofitable); (3) promotes the private sector's collaboration via nonprofit organizations as central hubs for cooperation with the Government; (4) highlights the Government's commitment to disrupt ransomware activities by rendering them unprofitable. Pillar Three deals with shaping market forces to drive security and resilience, (including insurance program), while Pillar Four focuses on investments and incentives.\nImplementation actions are necessary. In 2023 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") issued Introduction to Cybersecurity for Commercial Satellite Operations, a document setting non-binding standards which lack specificity.

More agencies should follow NOAA’s initiative to create specific standards guiding implementation.\nIn conclusion, all these documents reaffirm the U.S.’ commitment to improve resilience of cyber-systems, to practice effective deterrence against cyberattacks, and to use available countermeasures and the right of self-defense in case of attacks. However, with the growth of the lunar economy, a more concentrated emphasis on the Moon is advised.\n## B. NATO’s POSITION\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), established in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty,³⁶⁵ is a political and military alliance created as a collective defense organization among North American and European countries, totaling thirty-two members.³⁶⁶ Collective defense is NATO’s bedrock: NATO members pledge to consider an attack against any of its members as an attack against all, triggering a duty to respond collectively.³⁶⁷ Equally significant is the aspect of defense planning, meaning that the members collaborate on planning their defense and developing military capabilities against security challenges. Also crucial is the aspect of cooperative security, which means that NATO cooperates with non-member countries and international organizations to promote security and stability, such as conventional military threats, terrorism, and hybrid warfare, and cyberattacks.\nTo comprehend NATO’s stance on cyberattacks targeting satellites, it is essential to recognize that the matter resides at the intersection of NATO’s position on satellite defense and its response to cyberattacks. NATO has been increasingly focused on protecting and defending its members’ satellites, considering that satellites are crucial to communication, navigation, reconnaissance, and military operations. In 2019, NATO officially recognized space as an operational domain “alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace.”³⁶⁸\n---\n³⁶⁴.

Both satellites and ground-based facilities are potential targets for these threats.371 NATO's goal is not to become an independent space player,372 but to enhance and contribute to the efforts of its member states and collaborate with other pertinent international organizations.373 This includes enhancing space domain awareness374 in cooperation with space agencies and advancing counter-space capabilities and technologies for safeguarding space assets, including cybersecurity defense.\nNATO has reaffirmed its long-standing belief that cyberspace is continuously contested by various state and non-state actors.375 Most notably, NATO's robust engagement in cyber defense and the role of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (\"CCDCOE\") are evidenced by the Tallinn Manual.376 An important example of NATO's approach regarding a specific cyberattack exists. In 2007, Estonia endured a massive cyberattack from Russia, which was likely provoked by the controversial relocation of a Red Army statue to a cemetery.

Estonia invoked Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, alleging an attack by Russia. However, NATO determined that the events did not meet the threshold of an “armed attack,” reflecting an effects-based approach to assessing cyberattacks. Referring to UN Charter Article 51, NATO concluded that Russia’s actions did not qualify as an “armed attack,” and therefore, the right to self-defense for NATO member states did not come into effect.³⁷⁷\nIt is challenging to predict what NATO would do in case of a cyberattack on the Moon because it is a vastly different environment compared to Earth, and the impact of a cyberattack on a satellite or group of satellites may vary significantly. Also, on the Moon a cyberattack could be more impactful (due to the scarcity of satellites) or less impactful (due to the limited number of people affected). However, one could make a reasonable argument that if NATO did not view the extensive 2007 cyberattack in Estonia as meeting the criteria for a cyberattack requiring collective self-defense, it would be even more unlikely for NATO to categorize an attack on a lunar satellite in that way.\n## C. OTHER SPACEFARING COUNTRIES VIS-À-VIS LUNAR SATELLITES\n### 1. China\nChina’s progress in space technologies, initially non-military in nature, carries significant military implications because of their dual-use potential.³⁷⁸ This duality is evident in Chinese space missions like lunar exploration, where technologies developed for these purposes—such as robotics, radar networks, and materials—have the potential for military adaptation. While China may not explicitly articulate military intentions for space in their policies or directives, and consistently advocates for the use of outer space only for “peaceful purposes.”³⁷⁹\n³⁷⁷.

The Chinese White Papers “are silent on China’s policies about Space-based and/or Earth-based weapons for targets in Space. . . .

In section I, subsection 3, China reaffirmed to have “always advocated the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes any attempt to turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield or launch an arms race in outer space.” *Id.* The 2021 White Paper does not address military activities in space and only briefly references the defense of national security.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nChina's practice has suggested otherwise.³⁸⁰ China has indeed employed space for military objectives, and the military plays a crucial role in the Chinese space program.³⁸¹ BeiDou—China's GNSS system—serves as a prime example, demonstrating China's strategic utilization of dual-use technology to bolster its geopolitical influence.³⁸² Evidence of China's military focus in space includes the recent establishment of the Information Support Force (“ISF”), a military branch aimed at providing strategic support for network information systems under the Central Military Commission’s control to strengthen military capabilities through informatization and intelligence. This reorganization also involved dismantling the Strategic Support Force (“SSF”) and creating the Aerospace Force (“AF”) and Cyberspace Force (“CF”).³⁸³\nEvidence suggests that China regularly utilizes jamming and spoofing methods on GPS satellites to safeguard sensitive areas from drone surveillance or potential attacks. Additionally, there are reports of China targeting U.S. government satellites on a daily basis.³⁸⁴ If China gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable China might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well. China has also developed ground-based laser systems designed to dazzle the optical sensors of spy satellites as they pass over sensitive sites to temporarily prevent the satellite from taking a picture or physically damage the image sensor.³⁸⁵\n380.

Consider a scenario where reconnaissance satellites encircling the Moon traverse over Chinese installations, only to be dazzled.\n2. Russia\nNotwithstanding numerous declarations to the effect that space must be reserved for peaceful purposes,³⁸⁸ evidence exists that Russia continues in the militarization of space. Russian space law—largely governed by Federal Law No. 5663³⁸⁹—stipulates that space activities must adhere to legal provisions for safeguarding state secrets, military and commercial secrets, intellectual property, and exclusive rights. This suggests that the federal law acknowledges Russia's intention to utilize space for military purposes.³⁹⁰ Despite some progress in national security space capabilities, the Russian space industry is currently grappling with an era of stagnation.³⁹¹\nLately, Russia has heightened its efforts in developing antisatellite systems, with some of these efforts being publicly disclosed. Additionally, Russia has been engaged in the creation of orbital maneuvering satellites, potentially for tasks related to inspection and interception. The advancement in these technologies not only hints at Russia's intention to target reconnaissance and communication satellites, but also signifies a growing unease within Russia regarding the perceived weaponization of space by others.³⁹² Given Russia's long history of imperialism, reasonable doubts exist that its advocacy for peace in space might stem more from its current limited space capabilities, rather than from a genuine desire for space to remain a sanctuary.

CONCLUSION\nThis paper has delved into the issue of cyber-threats for satellites in non-Earth orbits, particularly in lunar orbits, amid escalating cyber-risks. The growing cislunar and lunar economy will heighten vulnerability, especially for commercial lunar satellites lacking robust protection. Just as Earth-orbiting satellites have faced increasing threats, lunar satellites will be confronted with similar risks in the expanding lunar economy. With a limited number of satellites orbiting the Moon, this paper has drawn insights from threats facing Earth's satellites to anticipate risks for lunar counterparts, focusing specifically on cyberthreats. Cyberthreats pose unique challenges due to attribution complexities and scope of the right of self-defense. This paper has examined cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and as armed attacks, assessing affected states' rights to self-defense. Considering provisions in the UN Charter and the OST, this paper has concluded that Article IV of the OST cannot be interpreted as impeding the right of self-defense of lunar satellites. Even if certain restrictions exist, this paper has argued that the right of self-defense would prevail when constrained by these limitations. Preserving security for both government and commercial satellites remains crucial for U.S. national interests, and it will become paramount on the Moon as well. The recognition that the right of self-defense is not diminished in space is an important component of satellite security.\n³⁹³. Dong L.

Lunar satellites present an opportunity to implement necessary protective measures on an open canvas. ## D. THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF LUNAR SATELLITES This paper has discussed how, as the lunar economy grows, dependable navigation and communication will be crucial for both government and private lunar missions. Currently, lunar orbits remain relatively uncrowded.¹⁰⁵ However, some satellites and orbiters from previous lunar missions are still orbiting the Moon. As of July 2023, there were at least six “active lunar orbiters:”¹⁰⁶ Artemis P1 and Artemis P2 (operating “in eccentric orbits of low inclination”); NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (orbiting “the Moon in a nearly polar, slightly elliptical orbit”); Chandrayaan-2 of the Indian Space Agency and Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (both operating in “in polar orbits of 100 km altitude”); and NASA’s Capstone (having a completely different, and much higher orbit).¹⁰⁷ Additionally, two non-operative spacecrafts (the 2009 Japanese Ouna and the Indian 2008 Chandrayaan-1) currently ¹⁰².

CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] orbit the Moon.¹⁰⁸ Lunar satellites will face geophysical threats coming from the Moon's environment.¹⁰⁹ The main concern is that the Moon is not nearby enough to quickly address these issues. Therefore, planned lunar missions must be sustainable and autonomous. In regards to cybersecurity, when planning lunar missions, scientists and engineers must use various models to approximate real conditions—such as thermal environments, difficulties in communications and navigation systems, placement and maneuvering of the spacecraft, as well as generation and storage of the power. However, uncertainties, unknowns, or unforeseen circumstances on the Moon may pose hazards for lunar missions.¹¹⁰ No documented cyberthreats have targeted satellites in lunar orbits, but security breaches in space agencies have sparked worries about mission safety. NASA frequently discloses cybersecurity issues, such as unauthorized attempts to access its systems. In 2019, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported a data breach resulting from unauthorized access.¹¹¹ Though these incidents might not have caused visible harm, NASA and other government entities and organizations must always focus on safeguarding their digital assets and infrastructure. Recognizing the critical role of lunar satellites, the 2022 National Cislunar Science &amp; Technology Strategy (\"NCS&amp;T Strategy\"),¹¹² in outlining its key objectives, provided for the need to \"implement Cislunar communications and PNT capabilities with scalable and interoperable approaches\"¹¹³ and for the extension of \"space situational awareness capabilities into Cislunar space.\"¹¹⁴ The NCS&amp;T Strategy contains two specific mentions of cybersecurity, clarifying that cybersecurity is ¹⁰⁸.

First, the U.S. government will define the necessary capabilities, taking into account factors such as cybersecurity, scalability, and the interoperability of related systems.¹¹⁵ Second, the NCS&amp;T Strategy will take the lead in the development of capability and technical standards that promote highly interoperable and scalable infrastructures, prioritizing cybersecurity, in the realms of cislunar communications, as well as necessary capabilities regarding Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (“PNT”) services.¹¹⁶ The cybersecurity vulnerability of satellites in cislunar orbits differs from that of satellites in Earth orbits. For example, as addressed above, the predictability of orbits increases the propensity to attacks but; predictability of orbit is not to be considered a problem for cislunar satellites. These satellites have the opposite problem; satellite orbits tend to shift continuously¹¹⁷ unless they are positioned in proximity of Lagrange points L4 and L5.¹¹⁸ As the lunar economy advances, both government and commercial satellite operators must remain vigilant in safeguarding their assets, even if they perceive cyber-risks as unlikely. This perception of unlikelihood could pose a particular challenge for commercial actors.¹¹⁹ Conversely, governments have been concerned about cybersecurity threats since the inception of the space program.¹²⁰ The government should be proactive in safeguarding commercial systems in a space protection plan because threats to commercial actors’ lunar ¹¹⁵.

The scale and frequency of maintenance maneuvers in cislunar space, notably around the Moon, heavily rely on the level of instability inherent in the trajectory. The authors also point out that for nonmaneuvering objects, once their position control is lost, the trajectory of the object can rapidly deviate from its projected path, often by a considerable margin.

Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government.¹²² While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.¹²³ In a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon.¹²⁴ Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities.¹²⁵ Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.¹²⁶"

CONCLUSION 726 This paper delves into the legal complexities surrounding the protection of non-Earth satellites, specifically lunar satellites within the expanding cislunar space, and focuses on the emerging cyberthreats confronting these satellites within the burgeoning lunar economy, drawing parallels with Earth's satellite security to anticipate future challenges. Highlighting the intricate nature of cyber threats and their impact on both governmental and commercial satellites, this paper examines cyberattacks as potential international wrongful acts and armed attacks. This paper evaluates the right of affected states to self-defense and scrutinizes Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty (\"OST\"), alongside other pertinent treaties' provisions. This paper concludes that Article IV of the OST should not be interpreted as to impede the right of self-defense for lunar satellites, and claims that the inherent right of self-defense overrides the OST's restrictions, allowing for protection for lunar satellite assets.\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES This paper discusses the legal issues of protecting satellites in lunar (and other non-earth) orbits from cyberattacks. Lunar satellites are included in the\"cislunar\"space¹ but present special characteristics that differentiate them from the satellites around Earth. This paper focuses on lunar satellites due to the expanding cislunar and lunar economy. This expansion is expected to result in an escalation of cyberrisks for lunar satellites—particularly for commercial ones, which have less robust protection compared to their military counterparts.² Similar to Earth-orbiting satellites³—upon which our economy has come to rely—which are facing growing threats from competitors and adversaries openly expressing their intention to disrupt these satellites in times of conflict,⁴ lunar satellites are likely to face the same threats, with the expansion of the lunar economy.⁵ Due to the limited number of satellites currently orbiting the Moon, this paper analyses the threats faced by Earth's satellites and derives insights applicable to lunar satellites. Potential adversaries are constantly trying to capitalize on perceived weaknesses in space capabilities,⁶ and satellites are exposed to several threats (including physical/kinetic, non-kinetic/physical, electronic, and cyber); however, this paper focuses on CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] cyberthreats.⁷ Cyberthreats are different from the other threats because establishing attribution in cyberattack cases is especially difficult,⁸ and assessing damages—particularly under the Liability Convention⁹—would be complex, thus making it even more challenging to seek satisfaction. Preserving the security of both governmental and commercial satellites is essential for the United States national interests.¹⁰ This paper will discuss in Part III(E) and Part IV, respectively, cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and cyberattacks as “armed attacks.”¹¹ In both cases, the affected state has a right to react, albeit with differing degrees of severity. Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)¹² prohibits use of force or threat thereof.¹³ Self-defense (including collective self-defense as in the North Atlantic Treaty)¹⁴ stands as an exception as per Article 51 of the UN Charter, incorporating a fundamental principle within customary international law.¹⁵ This paper examines if a cyberattack qualifies as use of force, granting affected states the right to countermeasures, and, if the cyberattack escalates to an armed attack, whether self-defense permits the use of force or threat thereof.¹⁶ The Preamble of the Outer Space Treaty (“OST”)¹⁷ frames exploration and use of space as an aspirational principle. However, “peaceful purposes” is not defined by the OST.¹⁸ Article IV of the OST—which is a rare instance in which the Moon and other celestial bodies are treated separately and distinct from the empty outer space—is the\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\n## II. SELECTED EXAMPLES OF LUNAR GOVERNMENTAL MISSIONS AND COMMERCIAL PROJECTS: THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF LUNAR SATELLITES\n## A. NEW “MOON RACE”\nA fresh competition to explore the Moon and utilize its resources has begun, driven by a combination of government initiatives and private ventures.²³ The 2020 Artemis Program is a joint U.S. and international initiative aimed at exploring and utilizing the Moon.²⁴ Its objectives include returning astronauts to the Moon by 2024,²⁵ or shortly thereafter, and establishing a permanent lunar base.²⁶ The private sector plays a crucial role,²⁷ such as contributing to rocket manufacturing,²⁸ the development of the crewed capsule Orion,²⁹ and participation in the construction of the orbiting station Gateway.³⁰\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] This program, which includes many non-U.S. partners, is set to jump-start the lunar economy.³¹ China's competing lunar program, the 2007 Chang'e Program,³² has already achieved notable accomplishments: Chang'e-1 and 2 mapped the lunar surface;³³ Chang'e-4 landed on the Far Side of the Moon; Chang'e-5 collected lunar samples and returned them to Earth; and Chang'e-6, which was recently launched, focuses on collecting samples from the Moon's Far Side.³⁴ China has plans for even more ambitious missions,³⁵ primarily for scientific, economic, and status-enhancing purposes,³⁶ including landing taikonauts³⁷ on the Moon and establishing an orbiting lunar station by 2030,³⁸ which also has international components.³⁹\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nLawfare, UNITED STATES INSTITUTE OF PEACE (Aug. 2, 2023), https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/08/china-and-space-next-frontier-lawfare.

THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF LUNAR SATELLITES In the lunar economy, both governmental entities and private enterprises will need dependable navigation and communication capabilities.⁵⁴ Under the Artemis program, a unified communication system will support all missions; The European Space Agency (“ESA”) will supply a complete network of satellites, which will operate through the Moonlight initiative consortium.⁵⁵ Lockheed Martin’s subsidiary, Crescent Space Services LLC, will provide Parsec, a lunar orbit satellite network catering to communication services for lunar spacecraft and surface operations. Anticipating a clientele mix from commercial entities and governmental organizations like NASA, the company will commence operations with two owned and operated satellites, scheduled\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nLunar activities will rely on satellites in various ways. First, for lunar communication: in order to maintain contact with assets on the lunar surface, lunar satellites will serve as communication relay stations, enabling data transfer, audio/video communication, and command and control of lunar rovers/other equipment.58 Upcoming lunar missions anticipate reliance on emerging cislunar space networks, comprising a special network for communication including relay satellites, orbiters, and spacecraft.59 With the establishment of a stable presence on the Moon, the communication need will be even more pressing. Before its Chang'e-4 mission, China positioned Queqiao, a relay satellite, into a halo orbit beyond the Moon. Its primary objective was to facilitate communication between Earth-based ground stations and the Far Side, where the Chang'e-4 lander would operate.60 To support its Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8, China launched another relay satellite, named Queqiao-2.61 Second, for navigation and positioning: lunar activities (including landing, navigation, mapping, and mining) will likely use satellite systems like Global Navigation Satellite System (\"GNSS\") or lunar-specific positioning systems to provide accurate location information CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] and ensure safe landings and precise movement on the lunar surface.⁶² Third, for cis lunar transportation, either from Earth's surface or from Earth's orbit to the Moon and back: it is likely that this transportation will involve coordination between the satellites in Earth's orbits and the various systems in lunar orbit to plan and perform a vast variety of lunar missions.⁶³ Fourth, for lunar exploration and scientific experiments: lunar satellites (e.g., remote sensing satellites) will play a crucial role in analyzing the lunar surface and mapping it, and in conducting scientific experiments from lunar orbit.⁶⁴ For example, China has been experimenting with a quantum cis lunar satellite.⁶⁵ Fifth, for espionage: because several stakeholders will operate on the Moon (and will often be adversary) lunar satellites will also play a reconnaissance role.⁶⁶ Espionage during peacetime, such as gathering intelligence through methods like visual photography, infrared imaging, radar, or other sensors, is not inherently a breach of international law.⁶⁷ However, the specific techniques employed may potentially constitute a ⁶².

CYBER-RISKS FOR SATELLITES\n### A. SELECTED EXAMPLES OF SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS\nSatellite hacking has occurred on multiple occasions.⁷⁰ In 2011, the U.S. issued a report, revealing that cyber-intruders (possibly connected to Chinese military groups) had disrupted the operations of two U.S. government satellites on four separate occasions in the previous years.⁷¹ Troubling incidents of cyberattacks have happened in connection with the Ukrainian War. Immediately prior the invasion, Russia initiated a massive cyberattack against ViaSat, a satellite company, disabling and infecting all the ground modems responsible for transmitting signals to/from the satellites, rendering the systems inoperable.⁷² The attack impacted not only Ukraine (which used ViaSat for military communication) but also other Central and Eastern European nations,\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] including Poland.73 Similarly, but on the opposing side, in June 2023, a Russian military satellite communications system, Dozor-Teleport, was disrupted for nearly twenty-four hours. Amtel-Svyaz, the parent company of Dozor, acted swiftly, taking control of one network while three remained down. Dozor-Teleport did not disclose specific attack details, and it is unclear whether the terrestrial network was affected or the satellites themselves. A self-proclaimed “hacktivist” organization and a branch of the Wagner Group both claimed responsibility, asserting that they sent malicious software to the satellite terminals.74 In 2022, Elon Musk revealed that SpaceX’s Starlink satellites had been subjected to numerous cyberattacks in the wake of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.75 ## B. WHY SATELLITES ARE PARTICULARLY EASY TARGETS FOR CYBERATTACKS A satellite could be attacked kinetically or non-kinetically. “Kinetic” means actions involving physical force or direct contact, such as bombings and other types of attacks that cause physical damage, while “non-kinetic” attacks are those that do not involve a direct physical force. A cyberattack—the focus of this paper—is a form of non-kinetic attack being carried out by digital means to compromise, disrupt, or damage data, infrastructure, or communication. The term “cyberattack” has several definitions, including the following: “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident or transiting these systems or networks.” Cyberattacks are performed through malware, hacking, denial-of-service, and other tactics aimed at compromising or disrupting computer systems, networks, and data. A cyberattack can aim at stealing sensitive information, or causing system malfunctions, or blocking the system (unblocking it only after the payment of a sum of money called ransomware).\nCyberattacks are not the only possible form of non-kinetic attacks. Spoofing (use of deceptive or fraudulent electronic data or communications to deceive, manipulate a system, or disguise the attacker’s\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nSatellites are prone to both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks because of their inherent characteristics. Scholars Georgeson and Stubbs explain that satellites are vulnerable due to several factors: (1) they are typically unshielded; (2) they follow predictable orbits, (3) they have limited maneuverability, (4) they are\"few enough in number\"that their destruction could have substantial repercussions; (5) replacing them is costly and consuming; and (6) numerous satellites have dual-use functionality, providing services to the military and to civilians, making them potential targets for enemy attacks.80 Not all of the factors mentioned above are equally relevant to protection against cyberattacks. As for shielding:81 while shielding against destructive attacks like kinetic anti-satellite missiles is difficult, protection against non-kinetic attacks is feasible (e.g., to safeguard against electronic attacks, a shutter shield could protect specific sensors or satellite lids; shielding could be effective against blinding lasers or dazzlers). Shielding satellites against kinetic attacks is not only challenging but also costly, as it increases expenses not only during CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] development but also during launch due to the added weight.82 Dissimilarly, protection against cyberattacks does not necessitate an increase in weight, and therefore launch costs. While development expenses are still a consideration, it is crucial for all satellite operators to create a robust cybersecurity system.\nAs for predictability of orbit and fuel scarcity: satellites follow predictable orbits,83 not only due to the laws of physics, but also because they carry limited fuel—which restricts their ability to make significant changes to their orbits. Additionally,84 technical limitations on maneuverability and fuel scarcity result in satellite operators being unable to make rapid maneuvers, even if they detect that an attack is coming.85 Cyberattacks would not be affected by predictability of orbit or limited maneuverability because cyberattacks happen in the\"cyberworld,\"where maneuverability is not necessary; only a robust cybersecurity program is essential.\nIn terms of the limited number (i.e., lack of redundancy of satellites), the landscape is swiftly evolving.86 While satellites remain relatively scarce, LEO constellations are significantly altering this scenario in many instances, making lack of redundancy somewhat less impactful. However, this is not universally applicable to every satellite type or operator. In certain instances, operators might not possess hundreds or thousands of satellites performing the same functions; they might have only a few, which play a pivotal role in providing crucial services.87 All things considered, satellites are still relatively few in number.88\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIn addition to the above factors, there are factors specific to cyberattacks, such as a lack of system redundancies, the remote nature of satellite operations, and limited or outdated computer resources. Some of the satellites lack system redundancy. System redundancy involves incorporating supplementary components, resources, or elements within a satellite that are not strictly essential for its operation but are included to improve reliability, availability, fault tolerance, and overall robustness.[92] Although redundant systems can still be susceptible to cyberattacks,[93] redundancy could mitigate the risk because, if a component is compromised due to a cyberattack, other components might be capable of fulfilling its functions. Today satellites—at least the larger ones—are designed with redundancy in mind.[94] [Satellites] are still relatively few in number (so destroying or damaging even a handful could have a major impact); they are\"soft\"(lacking heavy shielding or the ability to defend themselves from attack); they usually follow known, predictable orbital paths, with little ability to undertake evasive maneuvers (so they are easily trackable\"sitting ducks\").\nId.\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] Regarding the remote nature of operations, space systems are particularly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats due to the remote nature of their operations. Ground stations are also susceptible to cyberattacks;[95] if hackers access the ground station, they can seize control or disrupt the satellite. As satellites rely on communication links from ground stations, hackers can intercept or disrupt these links, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or temper with commands.[96] Also, because satellites are in orbit, they are physically inaccessible to their operator for in-person maintenance.[97] As for limited and outdated computer resources, satellites' limited computing resources make robust cybersecurity implementation challenging.[98] Furthermore, satellites' extended lifespan and outdated onboard systems, which are challenging to update or patch, provide fertile ground for evolving cyber threats.[99] ## C. THE IMPORTANCE OF SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY Satellites play a critical role in many sectors, including national security, banking, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation.[100] Therefore, satellites are prized targets for cyberattacks. As countries increase their investment in satellites, they also grow more reliant on them, thereby creating a higher potential reward for hostile entities capable of disrupting their operations.[101] In some cases, compromising a satellite can be an expeditious way of attacking adversaries in an international conflict, and—as discussed in Part IV—a cyberattack of a satellite could be the most ius in bello-compliant way to perform an attack on a satellite.\nConsidering all the above, both government and commercially operated satellites must implement robust cybersecurity measures to ensure their protection. These measures include encryption of data, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats promptly.\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\n## D. THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF LUNAR SATELLITES\nThis paper has discussed how, as the lunar economy grows, dependable navigation and communication will be crucial for both government and private lunar missions. Currently, lunar orbits remain relatively uncrowded.¹⁰⁵ However, some satellites and orbiters from previous lunar missions are still orbiting the Moon. As of July 2023, there were at least six “active lunar orbiters:”¹⁰⁶ Artemis P1 and Artemis P2 (operating “in eccentric orbits of low inclination”); NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (orbiting “the Moon in a nearly polar, slightly elliptical orbit”); Chandrayaan-2 of the Indian Space Agency and Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (both operating in “in polar orbits of 100 km altitude”); and NASA’s Capstone (having a completely different, and much higher orbit).¹⁰⁷ Additionally, two non-operative spacecrafts (the 2009 Japanese Ouna and the Indian 2008 Chandrayaan-1) currently\n¹⁰².

Therefore, planned lunar missions must be sustainable and autonomous. In regards to cybersecurity, when planning lunar missions, scientists and engineers must use various models to approximate real conditions—such as thermal environments, difficulties in communications and navigation systems, placement and maneuvering of the spacecraft, as well as generation and storage of the power. However, uncertainties, unknowns, or unforeseen circumstances on the Moon may pose hazards for lunar missions.¹¹⁰\nNo documented cyberthreats have targeted satellites in lunar orbits, but security breaches in space agencies have sparked worries about mission safety. NASA frequently discloses cybersecurity issues, such as unauthorized attempts to access its systems. In 2019, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported a data breach resulting from unauthorized access.¹¹¹ Though these incidents might not have caused visible harm, NASA and other government entities and organizations must always focus on safeguarding their digital assets and infrastructure.\nRecognizing the critical role of lunar satellites, the 2022 National Cislunar Science &amp; Technology Strategy (\"NCS&amp;T Strategy\"),¹¹² in outlining its key objectives, provided for the need to \"implement Cislunar communications and PNT capabilities with scalable and interoperable approaches\"¹¹³ and for the extension of \"space situational awareness capabilities into Cislunar space.\"¹¹⁴ The NCS&amp;T Strategy contains two specific mentions of cybersecurity, clarifying that cybersecurity is\n¹⁰⁸.

For example, as addressed above, the predictability of orbits increases the propensity to attacks but; predictability of orbit is not to be considered a problem for cislunar satellites. These satellites have the opposite problem; satellite orbits tend to shift continuously¹¹⁷ unless they are positioned in proximity of Lagrange points L4 and L5.¹¹⁸ As the lunar economy advances, both government and commercial satellite operators must remain vigilant in safeguarding their assets, even if they perceive cyber-risks as unlikely. This perception of unlikelihood could pose a particular challenge for commercial actors.¹¹⁹ Conversely, governments have been concerned about cybersecurity threats since the inception of the space program.¹²⁰ The government should be proactive in safeguarding commercial systems in a space protection plan because threats to commercial actors’ lunar ¹¹⁵.

Expert contributors noted that, apart from those serving the US military, commercial entities considered security issues as relatively less relevant to their day-to-day operations and should be left to the government.¹²² While some progress have been demonstrated recently, a 2021 space industry workshop hosted by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research revealed that there is a prevailing trend in the industry to exercise caution when engaging in security discussions to avoid alienating customers.¹²³ In a lunar economy driven by commercial entities, neglecting security could pose even greater problems than in Earth's orbit. Cybersecurity should be a key concern, as losing crucial data for lunar operations could have severe consequences, especially for satellites facilitating communication between Earth, space stations, and the Moon.¹²⁴ Also, there are two critical factors to consider. Firstly, a significant portion of lunar mining is projected to rely on robotic operations. Therefore, a cyberattack on lunar satellites could effectively halt mining activities.¹²⁵ Secondly, a cyberattack on the Moon, especially where crewed missions are anticipated, could directly endanger human lives.¹²⁶\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nieee.org/cybersecurity-in-space (arguing that cyberthreats targeting crewed spacecraft could involve tactics like infiltrating a craft’s internal computer system with malware or ransomware through close approaches).

Those measures could be recommended through the implementation of guidelines and best practices. Additionally, governments should consider providing incentives to encourage private entities to implement suitable cybersecurity measures for lunar satellites.\nSecuring lunar satellites is crucial as they determine the safety of lunar operations. Inspired by the ESA's depiction of lunar economic aspects, diverse potential scenarios emerge.¹³³ ESA lists several “[a]pplication Areas Supporting a Sustainable Lunar Presence.”¹³⁴ For example, the Moon will have solar panel farms for the production of electricity, water extraction facilities, manufacturing facilities utilizing regolith as construction material, transportation services, habitation to house humans, food production installations, waste management facilities, health services, educational facilities, entertainment facilities, smart infrastructures, and other services.¹³⁵ Cyber operations on the Moon and other celestial bodies may be conducted only for peaceful purposes. Rule 58 of the Tallinn Manual on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nThese rules should be strictly enforced. Consider the catastrophic impact of a cyberattack on a lunar satellite on any of the lunar applications mentioned above. For instance, the wellbeing of lunar residents is expected to be monitored and safeguarded with the assistance of lunar or Earth-based medical teams, utilizing telemedicine, including robotic procedures for surgeries. What potential catastrophic effects might result from a cyberattack that compromises these operations? How concerning would a cyberattack on food production or resource management be? Additionally, what risks would a cyberattack on the smart infrastructure controlling and maintaining lunar facilities pose? A cyberattack of this kind could easily qualify as an international wrongful act. More severe cyberattacks, such as the simultaneous targeting of all state lunar facilities, could even qualify as an\"armed attack\"by employing the scale/effect-based approach.¹⁴⁰ Rule 59—Respect for Space Activities: (a) A State must respect the right of States of registry to exercise jurisdiction and control over space objects appearing on their registries. (b) A State must conduct its cyber operations involving outer space with due regard for the need to avoid interference with the peaceful space activities of other States.\nId.\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] E. SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS AS INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS Even if uncertainties exist, numerous states, including the U.S., hold the view that the current international legal framework adequately governs the conduct of states in cyberspace.¹⁴¹ According to international law, a cyberattack could fall along the spectrum of international responsibility, use of force, and possibly armed attack. The boundaries between these scenarios are not always clearly defined.\nInternational responsibility comes into play when there is a violation of an obligation attributable to a state. An international wrongful act—which is a foundational principle in customary international law—causes a novel legal relationship to arise between states when there is a breach of an international obligation by one of them. In fact, the breach triggers a shift from a primary rule—which is a rule dictating state conduct—to a secondary set of rules of responsibility. Article 2 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ARSIWA”)¹⁴² defines an international wrongful act as a conduct—either action or omission—that is contrary to what a State is required to do by international law, including violations of treaties and customary international law, that is attributable to the State. When the breach is attributable to a state, it initiates a new relationship called a “secondary rule,” which evokes legal consequences for the breaching state. Articles 28–36 of ARSIWA outline the legal ramifications of an internationally wrongful act. The legal framework aims to resolve disputes peaceably without escalating to war. It encompasses the obligation of the breaching state to cease the wrongful conduct, prevent its recurrence, rectify the situation, pay damages, or give satisfaction.\nRule 14 of the Tallinn Manual (“Internationally wrongful cyber acts”)¹⁴³ provides that a state bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to a state and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation. The focus is on acts that are less severe than the use of force, but still carry international repercussions, such as the obligation to provide reparation.\n¹⁴¹ Brian J.

These principles outline guidelines regarding state responsibility.\n¹⁴³ See TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 67, and accompanying text.\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] The affected state has the right to take countermeasures, but does not have to respond with a cyberattack.¹⁴⁹ Countermeasures need not be in kind but must not be indiscriminate; their sole purpose should encourage responsible behavior aligned with the affected state's rights.¹⁵⁰ Furthermore, the countermeasures must not violate human rights, or engage in prohibited belligerent actions, breach peremptory norms, or violate diplomatic and consular inviolability.¹⁵¹ The countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury suffered.¹⁵² and cannot breach a legal obligation owed to a third party.¹⁵³ Some states have taken a clear position on when cyberattacks constitute an international wrongful act. For example, in 2018, the United Kingdom, declared that cyber operations targeting another state's territory, even below the use of force threshold, can breach international law. Consequently, the affected state, with clear attribution, can take non-forceful, necessary, and proportionate countermeasures directed at the offending state to restore compliance.¹⁵⁴ In 2019, Estonia adopted a similar stance, releasing a statement on countermeasures in the event of a cyberattack.¹⁵⁵ The U.S. made a similar pronouncement in 2021.¹⁵⁶ Ireland followed suit in 2023.¹⁵⁷ France took a similar stance, and went so far as to qualify cyberattacks as a possible violation of sovereignty.¹⁵⁸ Some states also provided extensive declarations regarding the legality\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\n## 2. Satellite Cyberattacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nWhile no recorded case of kinetic attacks on satellites exist,¹⁶¹ satellites have often been exposed to electronic and cyberattacks.¹⁶² It is worth noting that, from an international law perspective, an argument can be made that a satellite is a quasi-extension of a state's territory because of the quasi-jurisdiction principle of Article VIII of the OST.¹⁶³ Whether Article II OST¹⁶⁴ would bar satellites as a quasi-extension of a state's territory falls beyond the scope of this paper.¹⁶⁵ However, it is important to point out that Article II seems to only refer to land,¹⁶⁶ and it likely emerged from a concern about preventing the \"colonization\" of outer space.¹⁶⁷ This allows for the interpretation that the provision might not necessarily forbid considering a satellite as an extension of a state's territory. Even assuming the inability of states to claim satellites as extensions of their territory, this would not preclude the\n¹⁵⁹. See id.

This provides more than classic territorial jurisdiction and likely covers cyberattacks on the Moon.¹⁷⁰\nAlthough the number of reported cases of satellite cyberattacks is limited, satellite cybersecurity is gaining increased attention.¹⁷¹ China,¹⁷² Russia,¹⁷³ and the United States¹⁷⁴ all possess the capability to disrupt each other's satellites, space assets, and remote weapons using methods like spoofing, jamming, and dazzling.¹⁷⁵ Other countries\n\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of another State.

These tactics are certainly unlawful,¹⁸⁰ and, if attribution is possible,¹⁸¹ the affected state has the right to take countermeasures. Furthermore, if the tactic rises to the level of an “armed attack,” the situation could escalate to an international armed conflict.¹⁸² Spoofing, jamming, or dazzling affect satellites that are primarily used for national security or defense. Conversely, satellites with different applications, such as search and rescue satellites or civilian telecommunications, do not seem to face similar targeting.¹⁸³ Consequently, the satellite’s function, and particularly its contribution to defense or national security, appears to be a key factor in determining its susceptibility to these non-kinetic interferences.¹⁸⁴ Affected states have never officially attributed the attacks that they suffered to a specific state.¹⁸⁵ In the absence of formally attributed attacks, there is no precedent or established examples to indicate the threshold at which these interferences would prompt a response from the affected state. It would not be correct to read the absence of a reaction as a recognition that these interferences are necessarily lawful. However, we could at least imply that states, at the moment, would seem to tolerate these minimal interferences with their military or quasi-military satellites.¹⁸⁶ If this mindset carries over to lunar activities, there is a possibility that states might also accept these minor disruptions on the Moon. However, the approach might diverge concerning satellites not involved in military or quasi-military functions, potentially resulting in a different response to their attacks. Also, the unique lunar environment is characterized by its harsh conditions, where compromising even a single satellite could lead to catastrophic consequences. Such conditions could make it challenging to quickly\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nWhen it comes to potential interference with lunar satellites—be it spoofing, jamming, dazzling, or cyberattacks—the response strategy remains unpredictable. While it is legally permissible to retaliate in a similar manner, affected states are not obligated to do so.^[187]^ The key lies in ensuring any response is proportionate.^[188]^ Determining the nature of countermeasures hinges on what specific activities conducted on the Moon these interferences might disrupt. The type and extent of these activities will significantly shape the response strategy chosen by the affected states. It is reasonable to anticipate that disruptions affecting critical endeavors, such as human habitation or water production on the Moon, might prompt a more severe or stringent reaction.\n## IV. IUS AD BELLUM AND IUS IN BELLO AND THEIR APPLICATION TO SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS According to the proverbial expression\"all is fair in love and war,\"in matters of love and times of war, almost any action is considered acceptable. This paper does not intend to delve into the accuracy of the statement concerning matters of love, but certainly the expression is quite wrong for wars, which are far from being unregulated in international law. In fact, armed conflicts are governed by two distinct bodies of law. The first governs the initiation of an armed conflict (ius ad bellum).^[189]^ The second governs the conduct of hostilities (ius in bello). This second body of law is also known as laws of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") or as international humanitarian law (\"IHL\").\n## A. PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THE NOTION OF\"ARMED ATTACK\"This paper previously clarified that cyberattacks falling below a certain threshold were not deemed as\"armed attacks.\"^[190]^ It now explores the criteria defining when a cyberattack reaches the\"armed attack\"level, the resulting implications, and then addresses lunar CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] satellite issues. The existence of an “armed attack” is essential for justifying the use of force in self-defense, making it an integral part of the ius ad bellum. Also, when an “armed conflict” occurs, it activates for the belligerents the application of the ius in bello.¹⁹¹ Article 2.4 of the UN Charter¹⁹² provides that “[a]ll Members must abstain from the threat or use of force in their international relations against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This provision establishes the principle of non-aggression, rendering the use of force, threats of force, including acts of aggression and military interventions, illegal against a state’s territorial integrity or political independence. Notably, it also prohibits any use or threat of force that contradicts the United Nations’ purposes. Three instances exist where the prohibition of use of force within or against another state is lawful: (1) that state’s consent; (2) authorization from the UN Security Council; and (3) individual or collective self-defense.¹⁹³ This paper does not discuss the topic of states’ consent¹⁹⁴ or the UN Security Council’s authorization;¹⁹⁵ and it focuses on the right of self-defense, as specifically relevant to a reaction to a cyberattack on a satellite. Self-defense is a principle of customary international law, which is also recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter, which qualifies it as “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.”¹⁹⁶ This right exists whether exercised individually or collectively by states (as under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty).¹⁹⁷ Under the principle of self-defense, a state is allowed to employ force when confronted with an “armed attack.” Nevertheless, the pivotal issue lies in the definition of an “armed attack,” which ultimately determines the applicability of the right to self-defense.¹⁹⁸ The UN Charter does not provide a specific definition for the term “armed attack,” and records from the UN Charter’s drafters provide no definitive explanation of the term.¹⁹⁹ Scholars suggest that the inexplicit definition of “armed attack” may exist because the concept was thought to be self-evident. The drafters and negotiators consistently viewed aggression as the catalyst for justifiable self-defense. They\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIn general, scholars consider an “armed attack” as being more severe and significant than a mere use of force indicating that an action could amount to use of force without reaching the level of an “armed attack.” The distinction between forms of force that qualifies as “armed attacks” and actions that imply the use of force, but fall short of being an “armed attack” is unclear, even if some guidance is offered by the international case law.²⁰¹ Particularly important is the Nicaragua case,²⁰² which adopts the “scale and effects” test to judge whether particular hostile actions directed at a state reach the level of an “armed attack.” The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) specified, for instance, that an event as minor as a “border incident” does not qualify as an “armed attack.”²⁰³ Along the same lines, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission²⁰⁴ determined that “geographically limited clashes” in a “remote, unmarked, and disputed border” were not enough to be considered an “armed attack.” Likewise, “localized border encounters” involving “small infantry units,” even resulting “in loss of life” are not an “armed attack.”²⁰⁵ The Nicaragua case clarified that sending regular armed forces across a border or using irregular militias generally constitutes an armed attack. However, providing weapons to rebels across borders does not meet the threshold. The physical impact of an action—including evaluation of the territorial intrusion, casualties, or significant property damage—is a key consideration. Bombardments or kinetic attacks, only qualify as “armed attacks” if CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] they are of a substantial scale, have a major effect and are not mere border incidents. However, in the Oil Platforms case,²⁰⁶ the court ruled that “the mining of a single military vessel could be sufficient to meet the definition of an ‘armed attack.’”²⁰⁷ As discussed, at the United Nation San Francisco Conference of 1945, aggression was considered as the trigger for legitimate self-defense, specifically recognizing “armed attack” as a severe and separate form of aggression.²⁰⁸ For this reason, non-binding UN Resolution 3314 of the 1974 (“Definition of Aggression”)²⁰⁹ remains relevant for defining the term “armed attack.” Article I provides that “[a]ggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition.” Article II provides that “the First use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression” (unless the UN Security Council determines otherwise) while Article III goes on to list some examples of acts of aggression—like invasion, bombardment, blockade of ports, sending troops or mercenaries in another state, et cetera.²¹⁰ This paper will not delve any further on the general concept of “armed attack,”²¹¹ the previous discussion should adequately convey the complexity of this concept, which becomes even more challenging when applied to cyberattacks. Furthermore, imminence and immediacy are crucial; the right to use self-defense arises when an “armed attack” is ongoing or impending. The latter is commonly referred to as anticipatory self-defense (“Caroline Test”).²¹² Lastly, when evaluating\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\n## B. APPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF “ARMED ATTACK” TO CYBERATTACKS\nIn modern conflicts, cyberattacks can disrupt critical information assets, communications, and weapons systems. Cyberattacks can also cause political disruption by targeting finance, energy, transportation, and government services, thus creating social unrest.²¹⁴ In sum, a cyberattack can inflict damage well beyond that of a single bombardment.²¹⁵ Can a cyberattack be classified as \"an armed attack\" under the UN Charter?²¹⁶ Our discussion centers on cyberattacks existing independently of larger warfare contexts, such as the Ukrainian war.²¹⁷ The focus is on singular or multiple cyberattacks that, devoid of any other military actions, could be perceived as acts of aggression against national security.\nThe possibility for a cyberattack to rise to the level of an \"armed attack\" relevant under the UN Charter is the object of some debate. This paper takes the position that a satellite cyberattack can constitute—in\nthe sinking of an American steamboat (Caroline) used by Canadian insurgents, on orders of the British, caused a famous exchange of letters between United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British representative Lord Ashburton. *Id.* That correspondence is referred to as establishing the elements of the customary international right of self-defense. Webster wrote to Ashburton: \"Under these circumstances, and under those immediately connected with the transaction itself, it will be for her majesty's government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of national law, the destruction of the 'Caroline' is to be defended. It will be for that government to show a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" *Id.*\n²¹³. This paper does not discuss another self-defense restriction: a state invoking self-defense, must quickly inform the UN Security Council. The Council, under Chapter VII, is chiefly responsible for authorizing force in situations jeopardizing global peace, making decisions to maintain or restore it, potentially endorsing force if needed.\n²¹⁴.

Cyber warfare involves cyberattacks targeting nations, causing potential harm to critical infrastructure and even loss of life. However, defining what qualifies as cyber warfare remains a subject of debate among cybersecurity experts, with some suggesting it includes attacks that can result in fatalities. What is Cyber Warfare?, IMPERVA, https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/cyber-warfare/ (last visited Feb. 28, 2024).\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 57]\nitself—an “armed attack,” even if this will be rare. According to several scholars, cyberattacks can rise to the level of “armed attacks” as the UN Charter’s regulation regarding the use of force can be expanded to encompass cyberattacks conducted by one state against another through interpretative means. Several states share this position. For example, the United Kingdom asserted that, under specific circumstances, a cyberattack can be considered the equivalent of an “armed attack” triggering the right of self-defense. Ireland has adopted the “scale and effect” test, stating that use of force “may include instances where a cyber-operation does not cause physical damages such as where there is significant impairment of functionality of critical infrastructure.” “The circumstances under which non-injurious and non-destructive cyber operations might reach the use of force threshold remains a point of uncertainty among States.” However, only in “exceptional circumstances” could a cyber operation “reach this threshold.”²¹⁸ France asserted that the threshold for the use of force in cyberspace is not solely determined by the digital tools employed, but by the impact of the cyber operation itself. If the effects of a cyber operation resemble those of traditional weaponry, it breaches the prohibition on using force between states.²¹⁹ France acknowledges that even without physical consequences, a cyber operation could qualify as a use of force, in case of severe economic cyber impacts.²²⁰ France also declared the need to evaluate several criteria, including the operation’s origin, instigator’s nature, intrusion level, intended effects, and target, determines this assessment.²²¹ Singapore proclaimed that the factors to consider are several, including the context during the cyber operation, its origin, the intended or actual impact, the level of intrusion, and the characteristics of the target.²²² Singapore and Norway also recognized the possibility of severe economic cyber impacts being seen as an “armed attack.”²²³\nBeyond general views expressed on the topic as discussed above, there are no official statements from states regarding specific instances of cyberattacks. Consequently, experts have sought to bridge this gap in state practice by offering their insights on how international law applies in this domain.²²⁴ Particularly authoritative in this debate is\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nRule 68 of the Tallinn Manual—mimicking Article 2(4) UN Charter—prohibits the “threat or use of force... in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.”²²⁷ The Tallinn Manual adopts the scale and effect test. Rule 69 provides that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.” Generally speaking, the suggested scale and effects test for assessing when a cyber operation rises to the level of a use of force under Article 2(4) UN Charter and customary international law is now widely accepted, including by the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”).²²⁸ ## C. SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE Space has not seen direct armed conflict yet, but, unfortunately, it may be only a matter of time. As the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report put it: We know from history that every medium—air, land and sea—has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different. Given this virtual certainty, the U.S. must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space. This will require superior space capabilities.²²⁹ Currently, “despite international efforts to stem... militarization, outer space is now seen by some as a viable theater of future warfare, nature of the connection, if any, between the cyber activity and the particular armed conflict in question”). Egan points out that a growing number of states, as evidenced by various GGE reports, are acknowledging the applicability of international law to cyberspace, but seldom states openly express their views on the application of this law to particular cyber activities. Id. at 170–71. The UN GGE is a “Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) that deals with cyber issues in the context of international security.” Id. at 170.\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] no different from its land, sea, or air counterparts.”²³⁰ Considering the reliance of many countries on space for Earth activities and the growing importance of space activities themselves, “the prospect that conflict on Earth will spill into space is growing, because satellites have become a critical point of military vulnerability.”²³¹ In case a satellite is the object of a cyberattack, the possibility to exercise the right of self-defense needs to be analyzed. While it would seem generally accepted that, akin to physical conflicts, nations possess an inherent right to self-defense in the event of cyberattacks, the boundary of this right remains uncertain in international law, especially on whether the use of force is justified in response to a cyberattack.²³² While Article 51 UN Charter broadly encompasses various forms of attacks, including cyberattacks, the Tallinn Manual appropriately clarifies that a state targeted by a cyberattack maintains the right to self-defense. Rule 71 (“Self-defence against armed attack”) provides: “A State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”²³³ Some states have taken a stance on the right of self-defense in the case of cyberattacks. In 2018, the United Kingdom released the following statement: “It is clear that cyber operations that result in, or present an imminent threat of, death and destruction on an equivalent scale to an armed attack will give rise to an inherent right to take action in self-defence, as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.”²³⁴ The United Kingdom firmly believes that cyber operations leading to, or posing an immediate risk of, severe harm or destruction comparable to an “armed attack” warrant the inherent right to respond in self-defense, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.²³⁵ Canada also recognizes “that the inherent right of self-defence if an ‘armed attack’ occurs against a state also applies in cyberspace.”²³⁶\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nEstablishing attribution in case of a cyberattack that raises to the level of an armed attack is just as difficult as it in case of a cyberattack that does not raise to the level of an armed attack, as we discussed above.²³⁸ Technical attribution is difficult because a cyberattack can be launched from anywhere and perpetrators are often able to conceal their identity, and equally difficult is the attribution to a particular country.²³⁹ However, because in an armed conflict “cyberattacks frequently accompany and facilitate conventional attacks, attribution is less problematic when an armed conflict is already undergoing.”²⁴⁰ This paper discussed how self-defense requires imminence and immediacy, i.e. application of the Caroline Test.²⁴¹ Self-defense in case of a cyberattack is no exception. Rule 73 (“Imminence and immediacy”) of the Tallinn Manual provides, “[t]he right to use force in self-defense arises if a cyber armed attack occurs or is imminent. It is further subject to a requirement of immediacy.”²⁴² This paper also discussed how proportionality and necessity are also an issue in self-defense.²⁴³ Just as with a physical attack, the response of a targeted state to a cyberattack must align with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, the state is allowed only to take actions necessary to halt the attack or prevent additional ones. Rule 72 (“Necessity and proportionality”) of the Tallinn Manual provides “[a] use of force involving cyber operations undertaken by a State in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate.”²⁴⁴ As the scope of a legitimate self-defense in cyberspace is debatable, afflicted countries are generally cautious when responding to cyberattacks due to the potential for escalation. Typically, diplomatic avenues are prioritized over immediate military or cyber counterattacks in retaliation. Lastly, as for physical attacks, collective self-defense (e.g., NATO) is also allowed.²⁴⁵ CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] ## 2. Ius in Bello and Its Application to Satellite Cyberattacks The *ius in bello* governs the conduct of the hostilities, and has evolved over centuries. The *jus in bello* includes the laws of armed conflict (“LOAC”), alternatively known as international humanitarian law (“IHL”).²⁴⁶ This paper takes the position that IHL applies to conflicts in outer space,²⁴⁷ considering that the ICJ held that the IHL “applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future.”²⁴⁸ Consistent is the Tallinn Manual, which unambiguously provides that “[c]yber operations executed in the context of an armed conflict are subject to the law of armed conflict.”²⁴⁹ However, contrary opinions exist.²⁵⁰ There is limited discourse on applying IHL to satellites in lunar or other celestial bodies’ orbits, which is not surprising considering the early stage of the lunar economy and the presence of only a few satellites around the Moon. However, once the principle of IHL applying in outer space is accepted, there is no reason to restrict IHL application to Earth’s orbits.\nThis paper only briefly outlines IHL principles and examines their application in space, specifically focusing on satellites. The following discussion will briefly cover: (1) military necessity; (2) distinction; (3) proportionality; (4) precautions; (5) the principle of constant care; and (6) the principle of avoiding widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment. Military necessity mandates that any action in an international armed conflict must be justified as necessary to gain a clear military advantage.²⁵¹ Distinction requires a clear differentiation between civilians and combatants, as well as civilian and military objectives with operations directed solely at military objects.²⁵² Military objectives are those contributing to military action through their nature, location, purpose, or use, and when their (partial or total) destruction, capture, or neutralization provides a clear military advantage.²⁵³ Rule 93 of the Tallinn Manual clarifies that\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nA military satellite would be a fair target by\"nature,\"²⁵⁶ while a civilian satellite could be targeted if near a military satellite or the attack impacts military requirements or disrupts an adversary's orbital operations.²⁵⁷\"Use\"and\"purpose\"in space can introduce uncertainties, particularly regarding the intended purpose. Scholars note that sometimes the purpose of a space object is unclear, and a civilian or commercial space object can be easily converted to military use by reprogramming it to handle military data.²⁵⁸ Regarding the\"definitive military advantage\"requirement, the challenge in space arises from the potential for shifting object locations, changing ownership, or altered circumstances that may render the destruction of a space object no longer providing a clear military advantage.²⁵⁹ Complications arise from the dual-use nature of many space objects, serving both military and civilian roles (like the GPS system). Dual-use objects²⁶⁰ are considered military targets under the principle of distinction.²⁶¹ However, CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] evaluating whether those objects can be disrupted requires weighing other principles like proportionality, precautions, and ongoing care.²⁶² Proportionality dictates that an attack should not result in excessive collateral damage to civilians or non-military objects, in relation to the expected, specific, and direct military advantage.²⁶³ The assessment necessitates weighing projected civilian losses against military gains, taking into account all available information.²⁶⁴ Rule 113 of the Tallinn Manual dictates the prohibition to perform a “cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²⁶⁵ When a satellite is dual-use, proportionality is a significant concern because an attack on such a system could result in substantial civilian impact, making proportionality a potential barrier to attacking those objects.²⁶⁶ Precautions mandate attackers to exercise caution in their choice of attack methods, and presents a significant obstacle to targeting space objects, particularly due to the potential creation of space debris—a likely outcome if we are talking of kinetic attacks.²⁶⁷ Scholars suggest that a kinetic attack on a ground station might be the preferred method to achieve a clear military advantage while adhering to the principle of precautions. Rule 121 of the Tallinn Manual mandates the implementation of precautions as well.²⁶⁸ Satellite cyberattacks could be a viable option under the principle of precautions as it can blind satellites without generating debris.²⁶⁹ The principle of constant care (“requiring that constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians, and civilian objects”) requires evaluation of the impact on civilians, even when they are not in close proximity. This affects the proportionality balance.²⁷⁰ Rule 114 of the Tallinn Manual dictates that “during hostilities involving civilian purposes is prohibited if to do so would harm protected persons or objects.” Id. at Rule 112 (“Clearly separated and distinct military objectives”).\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nThis paper does not discuss international human rights law (IHRL), which in certain cases (states’ exercising power or control) could extend beyond a state’s territory, potentially reaching outer space where no sovereignty exists.²⁷⁴ Though not the main focus, IHRL factors like necessity, proportionality, precautions, and investigations are likely to impact decisions on satellite attacks, including cyberattacks.²⁷⁵ Applying IHRL to space raises concerns about potential violations of the right to life if individuals are killed through satellite targeting.²⁷⁶ In conclusion, satellite cyberattacks generally adhere to most IHL principles, except potentially the principle of proportionality.²⁷⁷ The significant repercussions of destroying certain satellites, like the GPS system, may pose challenges due to their impact on the broader civilian population, potentially violating the principle of proportionality. When considering cyberattacks on lunar satellites, several critical factors come into play. The vast distance to the Moon necessitates autonomous operations, making immediate human intervention improbable.\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] Additionally, the Moon presents harsh conditions, and any disruption to critical lunar satellites could result in catastrophic consequences. The implications of an attack on lunar satellites might not align with IHL principles, particularly concerning proportionality, as the magnitude of possible outcomes would far exceed acceptable limits, potentially causing indiscriminate harm. This raises concerns about the compatibility of such actions with the established framework of IHL. Furthermore, the growing lunar economy and increased human presence on the Moon will magnify the significance of IHRL concerns. As the utilization of lunar resources expands and human activities on the Moon increase, IHRL considerations are likely to emerge as pressing issues that need careful examination.\n## V. THE OUTER SPACE TREATY AND THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES VIS-À-VIS SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS ## A. THE OST PROVISIONS RELEVANT FOR SATELLITE CYBERATTACKS ### 1. Articles II, III, VIII, and IX of the OST This paper examines now the regulations governing outer space, primarily outlined in the OST, which apply during both peacetime and wartime.²⁷⁸ Thus, it is a crucial consideration when addressing cyberthreats to satellites. However, this paper takes the position that the principles of *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* are “the *lex specialis* during armed conflict and prevail over the general law of outer space.”²⁷⁹ Several provisions potentially impact the issue of cyberattacks on lunar satellites. First, Article II of the OST, which likely aimed at preventing the “colonization” of outer space,²⁸⁰ and which specifies, “[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”²⁸¹ The prevailing view asserts that this non-appropriation principle applies to both States and private ²⁷⁸. See, e.g., *id.* at 649 (citing to Michael N. Schmitt, *International law and military operations in space*, 10 Max Planck Y.B. U.N. L. 89 (2006); Dale Stephens &amp; Cassandra Steer, *Conflicts in space international humanitarian law and its application to space warfare*, 40 Annals Air &amp; Space L. 71 (2015); Macak, *Silent War*, supra note 250.).\n²⁷⁹.

See Eller, supra note 167.\n²⁸¹. OST, supra note 17, at Art. II.\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES Second, Article III of the OST, which mandates that states conduct activities in line with international law—including the UN Charter—and aims to uphold international peace, security, cooperation, and understanding.²⁸⁶ As a result of this provision, the use of force and its threat are forbidden under Article 2.4 of the UN Charter, except as permitted by Article 51 (pertaining to self-defense) and decisions of the UN Security Council.²⁸⁷ Third, Article VIII OST,²⁸⁸ which stipulates that a state retains jurisdiction and control over an object launched into outer space under its registry.²⁸⁹ This registration implies authority over the registered object.²⁹⁰ Consequently, a satellite circling the Moon falls under the jurisdiction of the state that officially registered it. This provision establishes a form of jurisdiction similar to the concept of a “flag” state, resembling territorial control over the registered space object A major imperative for declaring international law, including the UN charter, applicable to outer space, was the overriding concern for the maintenance of international peace and security, which, after all, is the primary purpose and responsibility of the United Nations (UN) and the fear for an arms race in outer space. Thus, generally accepted rules and principles, such as the prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defense, would also be in force in outer space. Id. OST, supra note 17, at Art. VIII.\n\nThe registry of a space object has the same legal consequences as registering a ship or an aircraft. The only difference is that in Space Law, inclusion in the national registry does not confer nationality de jure to the spacecraft, only jurisdiction and control thereon. However, in practice such inclusion entitles the State of registry to exercise its sovereignty over the registered object. This amounts to a quasi-nationality or nationality de facto of the space object.\nId.\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] akin to an airplane flagged with a particular state.²⁹¹ Notably, Article VIII applies solely to “launched” objects, excluding items constructed in space. Therefore, it will not be applicable to satellites constructed directly in lunar orbits.\nFourth, Article IX:²⁹² this paper will only briefly mention the principle of due regard. “In the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty... shall conduct all their activities in outer space... with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty.”²⁹³ Due regard, akin to a primary “duty of care,”²⁹⁴ stands as a potential mechanism for international responsibility regarding wrongful acts. For example, if State A (or one of its nationals) conducts a cyberattack on a lunar satellites of State B (or one of its nationals), State A would not show proper consideration for the activity of State B. This would violate the obligation of due regard, activating the secondary rule of responsibility previously addressed.²⁹⁵ The exact scope of due regard remains unclear as this provision has never been used, resulting in a dearth of established State practices. In practice, State parties seem hesitant or unwilling to directly acknowledge the concept of “due regard.”²⁹⁶ ## 2. Article IV(1) of the OST The only substantive provision of the OST dealing with military use is Article IV, which (1) prohibits placing in orbit/installing/stationing (as opposed to transiting) nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction in space; (2) requires using the Moon and other celestial bodies (but not empty space) “exclusively for peaceful purposes”;²⁹⁷ and\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nWhile more specific than other provisions of the OST, Article IV uses general language and lacks crucial definitions, especially as it pertains to terms such as\"weapons of mass destructions,\"\"peaceful,\"and\"military.\"298 Article IV(1) establishes a ban on certain types of weapons in space (\"nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\"), which cannot be placed\"in orbit around the earth,\"installed\"on celestial bodies,\"\"or stationed in outer space in any other manner.\"299 It does not impose restrictions on non-weapons of mass destruction.300 Article IV(1) of the OST has no bearing on the capacity to protect lunar satellites against cyberattacks. In fact, neither nuclear weapons nor weapons of mass destruction are requisite for deterring cyberattacks on lunar satellites. Not only are these weapons unnecessary, but they would also run counter to the principle of proportionality, which governs both the employment of countermeasures for international wrongful acts and the lawful response to\"armed attacks\"in self-defense.\n## 3. Article IV(2) of the OST Article IV(2) of the OST provides that\"the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes\"and bans\"[t]he establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies.\"It provides two exceptions to this overarching prohibition: (1)\"[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,\"and (2)\"[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.\"Article IV(2) of the OST could potentially impact the capacity for deterrence and defense against cyberattacks if it were deemed applicable to orbital regions—a stance this paper does not support—as elucidated below. Before delving into the rationale for this position, let us assess the implications of Article IV(2) of the OST within the specific CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] spatial domains it pertains to. In providing that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used... exclusively for peaceful purposes,” the provision would seem to exclude the possibility to militarily defend the assets. Even assuming that this provision does indeed pertain to orbital regions, this provision should not be construed as limiting the right of self-defense. First, the right of self-defense is a well-established norm of customary international law, solidified in Article 51 UN Charter. Its significance and authority are unlikely to be susceptible to influence by a provision framed in such broadly general terms as Article IV(2). Therefore, the right of self-defense must exist in outer space (contrary views exist).³⁰¹ Second, in case of an armed conflict, ius ad bellum and ius in bello are lex specialix that prevail the OST. Article 103 of the UN Charter provides that in cases where members of the United Nations have conflicting obligations under the current Charter and other international agreements, the obligations under the UN Charter shall prevail.³⁰² Third, the term “peaceful” under Article IV(2) should be interpreted as “non-aggressive” and not “as non-military.”³⁰³ The term “peaceful” also appears in the Preamble, Article IX, and Article XI. However, it is only in Article IV(2) that the term “peaceful” is paired with “exclusively,” creating a distinct regulatory emphasis on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Some scholars have pointed out that this is significant to give a special regime to the Moon and other celestial bodies, no matter how the term “peaceful” is interpreted within the OST, the crucial point lies in how Article IV(2) combines it with the term “exclusively.”³⁰⁴\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nAlso, the second part of Article IV(2) poses no hindrance to the deterrence and defense of lunar satellites. It explicitly prohibits the utilization of celestial bodies for military bases, weapon testing, and military maneuvers. Arguably, deterrence and protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks are unlikely to necessitate the establishment Purposes Provisions in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, Spring 1976, Number 1, at 3, 16 (internal quotation omitted) (arguing that\"this use... excludes all kinds of military, and not only warlike activities on planets other than the Earth\"); Bin Cheng, Properly Speaking, Only Celestial Bodies Have Been Reserved for Use Exclusively for Peaceful (Non-Military) Purposes, but Not Outer Void Space, 75 INT'L. L. STU. 81 (2000).\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] of military bases, weapon testing, or any military maneuvers. However, if that were the case, the two explicitly stated exceptions to this provision would come into play. As mentioned, these exceptions are as follows: (1) “[t]he use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited,” and (2) “[t]he use of any equipment or facility necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies shall also not be prohibited.” Either of these exceptions provides ample flexibility to permit deterrence and protection of lunar satellites. In fact, the satellites slated for deployment around the Moon, at least initially, will serve “scientific research or other peaceful purposes,” such as experiments and enabling lunar mining. An argument can be constructed, therefore, that the deployment of “military personnel” essential for deterring and defending these satellites should fall under this exception. Additionally, under the second exception, the use of any equipment or facility necessary for deterring attacks on and safeguarding these satellites should also be permissible, even if generally prohibited by the overarching provision of the latter part of Article IV(2) because at least initially the lunar satellites will be “necessary for peaceful exploration of the moon.”\nFurthermore, this paper argues that Article IV(2) exclusively applies to the Moon and celestial bodies themselves and does not encompass lunar orbits (as well as the orbits of other planets).[310] Lunar orbits and similar regions can be arguably considered part of empty outer space, exclusively covered by Article IV(1). Consequently, if the need for military defense against cyberattacks on lunar satellites were to arise, it would be legal to station military personnel and equipment in the vicinity of the Moon or lunar orbit (as opposed to the lunar surface). There are several reasons why Article IV(2) does not extend to these orbits. First, the general principle is that Article I of the OST's freedom of use applies to\"empty outer space,\"[311] while the regulation of celestial bodies is the exception. Given that Article IV(2) contains an exception to a general principle, it should be narrowly construed. Second, at least some orbits (i.e., Earth's orbit) have been used\"militarily\"since the inception of the space age, and no state has significantly objected to that use.[312] Therefore, state practice supports the argument that orbits are empty outer space and are not covered by Article IV(2). According to Article 31.3(b) of the Vienna Convention on\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] necessity of using lunar orbit for lunar activities may seem logical. However, this argument is less compelling compared to the opposing view supported by the reasons mentioned earlier.\n## B. THE OTHER SPACE TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE ARRANGEMENTS ### 1. The Other Space Treaties After the OST was enacted in 1967, several other significant treaties were signed between 1968 and 1976. These treaties, namely the Rescue Agreement,³¹⁶ Liability Convention,³¹⁷ and Registration Convention,³¹⁸ also pertain to Moon activities and Moon satellites. None of these treaties are highly pertinent to the subject of this paper, except for the Liability Convention, which could be relevant if a cyber-attack results in measurable damage for which the victim-state seeks compensation.\nIn 1979—the Moon Agreement was signed³¹⁹—and it could have had the potential to significantly influence the subject of this paper. However, this treaty ultimately failed due to the limited number of ratifications. Therefore, while differing opinions exist,³²⁰ this paper contends that the dismissal of the Moon Agreement by the vast majority of states³²¹ (including all major space-faring nations except India and Australia) renders it largely irrelevant for our analysis. However, as previously discussed, it can still serve a purpose when employed in a contrasting manner to enhance our understanding of the interpretation of OST. In other words, if the Moon Agreement found it necessary to address a particular issue, it implies that the OST does not cover that aspect.\n### 2.

Section 5 (“Interoperability”) provides that the Signatories acknowledge that the use of compatible and shared exploration infrastructure and standards (including standard for communication systems) advances exploration, scientific research, and commercial utilization. Therefore the Signatories commit to strive to employ existing interoperability standards, or to create new standards when current ones are absent or insufficient. Interoperability enhances cybersecurity³²⁶ and therefore, by providing this commitment, the Artemis Accords significantly increase protection of lunar satellites from cyberattacks. Section 11 (“Deconfliction of Space Activities”), and in particular, Sections 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 are relevant. First, in Section 11.1, the Signatories reconfirm their commitment to the OST with alignment on provisions such as due regard and prevention of harmful interference. Second, in Section 11.3 the Signatories reaffirm the commitment to use due regard, as per Article IX of the OST. Section 11.3 also provides that if a Signatory fears or has suffered harmful interference, that Signatory can initiate a consultation with the other Signatory that authorized the activity (or any party to the OST). Lastly, Section 11.4 commits the Signatories to avoid deliberate actions that could lead to harmful interference with each other’s utilization of outer space.

DEFENDING MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITES ## A. UNITED STATES' SATELLITE CYBERSECURITY AND DEFENSE While the attitude of the U.S. towards space exploration and use is peaceful,³²⁷ the United States has repeatedly reaffirmed its right to take countermeasures, its right of self-defense, and its intention to use these rights in case its space activities are threatened.³²⁸ For years, the U.S. has recognized the vulnerability of space objects to both physical attacks and cyberattacks. Already in 2001, the Rumsfeld Space Commission Report pointed out that “with the growing commercial and national security use of space, U.S. assets in space and on the ground offer just such targets. The U.S. is an attractive candidate for a ‘Space Pearl Harbor.’”³²⁹ The concept of space as a domain at risk is repeated in many documents of military doctrine: [I]n the contested, congested, and competitive space warfighting domain, our potential adversaries continue to develop, test, and proliferate sophisticated weapons. These weapons have the potential to be the most severe risks to orbital flight. To minimize this risk, it is imperative we execute threat-focused space operations that are fully integrated with timely and relevant intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.³³⁰ President Obama’s National Space Policy³³¹ (“2010 NSP”) emphasizes the safeguarding of space assets mentioning the following necessities: (1) to ensure cost-effective resilience of space capabilities based on their planned use, potential consequences of capability loss, threat levels, and the availability of alternative means to fulfill missions; and (2) to develop and employ strategies and capabilities for the safeguard of critical national security space-dependent missions, including rapid asset restoration and leveraging diverse resources for mission execution.³³² The 2010 NSP suggests proliferation of space capabilities as ³²⁷. 51 U.S.C. § 20102 (“Congressional declaration of policy and purpose”) provides that “Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.” *Id.* ³²⁸.

If deterrence fails, the right to self-defense is invoked in accordance with international law and treaty obligations.[334] The 2011 NSSS specified that, although the U.S. believes that all space-faring nations should strive to prevent space hostilities, it acknowledges that some actors might still see military advantage in space-based actions.[335] In 2018, the Trump Administration issued the U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy,[336] and instituted the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency.[337] Specifically on cybersecurity for space, the Trump Administration issued Space Policy Directive 5 - Cybersecurity Principles for Space System (\"SPD-5\"), which focused on cybersecurity for space systems and urged federal agencies and non-governmental space operators to establish cybersecurity norms.[338] In 2020, the National Space Policy (\"2020 NSP\")[339] reaffirmed the right of self-defense providing that if any adversary jeopardizes the advantages that the U.S. gains from space, the U.S. will use all means to deter and, if needed, overcome hostile actions in space. The U.S. will continue to use space for national security, including the right of self-defense, as unfettered access and operational freedom in space CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] are crucial national interests.³⁴⁰ The 2020 NSP specifies that the U.S. regards intentional interference with space systems (including their support and infrastructure) as a violation of its national rights.³⁴¹ The focus of the 2020 NSP is on deterring and countering threats to the U.S. and their allies' space interests; it clarified that any attack on, or intentional interference with, these interests will be met with a calculated response at a time, place, and manner according to U.S. discretion.³⁴² A cyberattack of a satellite is obviously an attack/intentional interference with a space system and will therefore be considered an infringement of the U.S.' rights. The U.S. will seek to deter that threat, but if unsuccessful will respond appropriately, and not necessarily in kind.\nThe 2020 NSP emphasizes the U.S.' intention of developing plans and capabilities to counter any interference or attack on U.S. or allied space systems, especially those vital for critical infrastructure, enabling a responsive approach as determined by the U.S.³⁴³ The 2020 NSP highlights that the U.S. aims for a secure, stable, and open space environment. It also recognizes that the space domain has evolved into a\"warfighting domain\"due to the actions of competitors.³⁴⁴ Noting the critical importance of space security for both U.S. and global stability, the 2020 NSP outlines the need for the U.S. to enhance its security systems, policies, and strategies to safeguard its space interests, dictating specific principles.³⁴⁵ The 2020 NSP designates Space Force as the main military branch for space, with the responsibility to organize, train, and equip forces to protect national interests in space and ensure access to space. Space Force will also supply forces for offensive, defensive, and support operations to U.S. Space Command and other commands.³⁴⁶ The Secretary of Defense is tasked with protecting the use of space for U.S. national security, economic interests, and those of allies and partners.³⁴⁷ The 2020 NSP also places significant emphasis on cybersecurity, committing to integrate it into all aspects of the space\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nWhile the Biden Administration has yet to release a national space policy, it has reaffirmed the significance of cybersecurity in 2023 through the National Cybersecurity Strategy (“2023 NCSS”),³⁵⁰ which also applies to space. Recognizing that the convergence of the digital and physical realms poses a risk to national systems, the 2023 NCSS establishes three key principles: (1) obtaining global recognition that international law is applicable in cyberspace in times of peace or war; (2) obtaining consensus on norms of responsible behavior; and (3) promoting trust-building measures for inter-state cooperation.³⁵¹ With specific reference to space, the 2023 NCSS notes how reliance on space assets is increasing cyberrisks, and the transition of numerous critical systems to digital platforms is exacerbating the potential damage from cyberattacks.³⁵² The 2023 NCSS also points out the increasing reliance of the government on the commercial sectors for national security needs.³⁵³ Building on previous Administrations’ documents (and especially SPD-5),³⁵⁴ the 2023 NCSS contains “four pillars”: Pillar One, Defend Critical Infrastructure;³⁵⁵ Pillar Two, Disrupt and Dismantle Threat CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] Actors; Pillar Three, Shape Market Forces to Drive Security and Resilience; and Pillar Four, Invest in a Resilient Future. For the purpose of this paper, Pillar Two is the most important because it: (1) outlines the U.S. strategy to employ all available means (including diplomacy, information, finance, intelligence, and law enforcement) to deter potential attackers from jeopardizing U.S. interests, and to halt malicious actors from conducting extended cyber-campaigns that are a threat to national security and public safety;[356] (2) expresses the U.S.' intention to execute continuous and precisely targeted\"disruption campaigns\"to dissuade cybercriminals from engaging in cyber-activities (including by making those activities unprofitable);[357] (3) promotes the private sector's collaboration via nonprofit organizations as central hubs for cooperation with the Government;[358] (4) highlights the Government's commitment to disrupt ransomware activities by rendering them unprofitable.[359] Pillar Three[360] deals with shaping market forces to drive security and resilience, (including insurance program),[361] while Pillar Four focuses on investments and incentives.[362] Implementation actions are necessary. In 2023 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") issued Introduction to Cybersecurity for Commercial Satellite Operations,[363] a document setting non-binding standards which lack specificity. Among the U.S. agencies with space competence, only the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\")—which administers licensing sectors will benefit the resilience of space assets, since some of the critical sectors are connected to space.\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIn conclusion, all these documents reaffirm the U.S.’ commitment to improve resilience of cyber-systems, to practice effective deterrence against cyberattacks, and to use available countermeasures and the right of self-defense in case of attacks. However, with the growth of the lunar economy, a more concentrated emphasis on the Moon is advised.\n## B. NATO’s POSITION The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), established in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty,³⁶⁵ is a political and military alliance created as a collective defense organization among North American and European countries, totaling thirty-two members.³⁶⁶ Collective defense is NATO’s bedrock: NATO members pledge to consider an attack against any of its members as an attack against all, triggering a duty to respond collectively.³⁶⁷ Equally significant is the aspect of defense planning, meaning that the members collaborate on planning their defense and developing military capabilities against security challenges. Also crucial is the aspect of cooperative security, which means that NATO cooperates with non-member countries and international organizations to promote security and stability, such as conventional military threats, terrorism, and hybrid warfare, and cyberattacks.\nTo comprehend NATO’s stance on cyberattacks targeting satellites, it is essential to recognize that the matter resides at the intersection of NATO’s position on satellite defense and its response to cyberattacks. NATO has been increasingly focused on protecting and defending its members’ satellites, considering that satellites are crucial to communication, navigation, reconnaissance, and military operations. In 2019, NATO officially recognized space as an operational domain “alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace.”³⁶⁸ --- ³⁶⁴.

ALLIED COMMAND TRANSFORMATION, https://www.act.nato.int/our-work/network-%20community/natos-approach-to-%20space/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Allies%20adopted%20NATO’s,as%20 CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] In the most recent of its space policies, NATO outlined its approach to space security, including satellite defense.369 NATO acknowledged that potential adversaries have been developing a wide array of counter-space capabilities aimed at disrupting, degrading, deceiving, denying, or destroying crucial capabilities and services.370 NATO also addressed the fact that space-related threats can take different forms with varying levels of severity, ranging from mild disruptions (like jamming signals) to severe (and potentially irreversible) damage with long-term consequences. Both satellites and ground-based facilities are potential targets for these threats.371 NATO's goal is not to become an independent space player,372 but to enhance and contribute to the efforts of its member states and collaborate with other pertinent international organizations.373 This includes enhancing space domain awareness374 in cooperation with space agencies and advancing counter-space capabilities and technologies for safeguarding space assets, including cybersecurity defense.\nNATO has reaffirmed its long-standing belief that cyberspace is continuously contested by various state and non-state actors.375 Most notably, NATO's robust engagement in cyber defense and the role of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (\"CCDCOE\") are evidenced by the Tallinn Manual.376 An important example of NATO's approach regarding a specific cyberattack exists. In 2007, Estonia endured a massive cyberattack from Russia, which was likely provoked by the controversial relocation of a Red Army statue to a cemetery. The cyberattacks persisted for weeks, impacting banks, media communications%2C%20navigation%20%20and%20intelligence (last visited Mar. 16, 2024).\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nIt is challenging to predict what NATO would do in case of a cyberattack on the Moon because it is a vastly different environment compared to Earth, and the impact of a cyberattack on a satellite or group of satellites may vary significantly. Also, on the Moon a cyberattack could be more impactful (due to the scarcity of satellites) or less impactful (due to the limited number of people affected). However, one could make a reasonable argument that if NATO did not view the extensive 2007 cyberattack in Estonia as meeting the criteria for a cyberattack requiring collective self-defense, it would be even more unlikely for NATO to categorize an attack on a lunar satellite in that way.\n## C. OTHER SPACEFARING COUNTRIES VIS-À-VIS LUNAR SATELLITES ### 1. China China’s progress in space technologies, initially non-military in nature, carries significant military implications because of their dual-use potential.³⁷⁸ This duality is evident in Chinese space missions like lunar exploration, where technologies developed for these purposes—such as robotics, radar networks, and materials—have the potential for military adaptation. While China may not explicitly articulate military intentions for space in their policies or directives, and consistently advocates for the use of outer space only for “peaceful purposes.”³⁷⁹ ³⁷⁷. Damien McGuinness, *How a cyber attack transformed Estonia*, BBC NEWS (Apr. 17, 2017), https://www.bbc.com/news/39655415.\n³⁷⁸. *China’s White Papers on Space*, supra note 33, at 8. The Chinese White Papers “are silent on China’s policies about Space-based and/or Earth-based weapons for targets in Space.... There is no mention of investments in technologies like jamming technology.” *Id.* The truth, however, is that “[t]he emphasis in the White Papers is on the civilian aspects of the Chinese Space programme.” *Id.* at 9.\n³⁷⁹. *China’s Space Program: A 2021 Perspective*, THE STATE COUNCIL INFO. OFF. OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (Jan. 28, 2022), www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465645/n6465648/c6813088/content.html (“2021 White Paper”). In section I, subsection 3, China reaffirmed to have “always advocated the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes any attempt to turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield or launch an arms race in outer space.” *Id.* The 2021 White Paper does not address military activities in space and only briefly references the defense of national security.\nCREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] China's practice has suggested otherwise.³⁸⁰ China has indeed employed space for military objectives, and the military plays a crucial role in the Chinese space program.³⁸¹ BeiDou—China's GNSS system—serves as a prime example, demonstrating China's strategic utilization of dual-use technology to bolster its geopolitical influence.³⁸² Evidence of China's military focus in space includes the recent establishment of the Information Support Force (“ISF”), a military branch aimed at providing strategic support for network information systems under the Central Military Commission’s control to strengthen military capabilities through informatization and intelligence. This reorganization also involved dismantling the Strategic Support Force (“SSF”) and creating the Aerospace Force (“AF”) and Cyberspace Force (“CF”).³⁸³ Evidence suggests that China regularly utilizes jamming and spoofing methods on GPS satellites to safeguard sensitive areas from drone surveillance or potential attacks. Additionally, there are reports of China targeting U.S. government satellites on a daily basis.³⁸⁴ If China gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable China might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well. China has also developed ground-based laser systems designed to dazzle the optical sensors of spy satellites as they pass over sensitive sites to temporarily prevent the satellite from taking a picture or physically damage the image sensor.³⁸⁵\n\n2024] CYBERATTACKS: LEGAL ISSUES\n\nNotwithstanding numerous declarations to the effect that space must be reserved for peaceful purposes,³⁸⁸ evidence exists that Russia continues in the militarization of space. Russian space law—largely governed by Federal Law No. 5663³⁸⁹—stipulates that space activities must adhere to legal provisions for safeguarding state secrets, military and commercial secrets, intellectual property, and exclusive rights. This suggests that the federal law acknowledges Russia's intention to utilize space for military purposes.³⁹⁰ Despite some progress in national security space capabilities, the Russian space industry is currently grappling with an era of stagnation.³⁹¹ Lately, Russia has heightened its efforts in developing antisatellite systems, with some of these efforts being publicly disclosed. Additionally, Russia has been engaged in the creation of orbital maneuvering satellites, potentially for tasks related to inspection and interception. The advancement in these technologies not only hints at Russia's intention to target reconnaissance and communication satellites, but also signifies a growing unease within Russia regarding the perceived weaponization of space by others.³⁹² Given Russia's long history of imperialism, reasonable doubts exist that its advocacy for peace in space might stem more from its current limited space capabilities, rather than from a genuine desire for space to remain a sanctuary. There is evidence suggesting Russia regularly uses jamming and CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 57] spoofing methods on GPS satellites to protect sensitive areas from surveillance or attacks.³⁹³ Additionally, there are reports of Russia targeting U.S. government satellites daily.³⁹⁴ If Russia gains the capability and sees benefits, it is conceivable they might extend these techniques to lunar satellites as well.\n## VII. CONCLUSION This paper has delved into the issue of cyber-threats for satellites in non-Earth orbits, particularly in lunar orbits, amid escalating cyber-risks. The growing cislunar and lunar economy will heighten vulnerability, especially for commercial lunar satellites lacking robust protection. Just as Earth-orbiting satellites have faced increasing threats, lunar satellites will be confronted with similar risks in the expanding lunar economy. With a limited number of satellites orbiting the Moon, this paper has drawn insights from threats facing Earth's satellites to anticipate risks for lunar counterparts, focusing specifically on cyberthreats. Cyberthreats pose unique challenges due to attribution complexities and scope of the right of self-defense. This paper has examined cyberattacks as international wrongful acts and as armed attacks, assessing affected states' rights to self-defense. Considering provisions in the UN Charter and the OST, this paper has concluded that Article IV of the OST cannot be interpreted as impeding the right of self-defense of lunar satellites. Even if certain restrictions exist, this paper has argued that the right of self-defense would prevail when constrained by these limitations. Preserving security for both government and commercial satellites remains crucial for U.S. national interests, and it will become paramount on the Moon as well. The recognition that the right of self-defense is not diminished in space is an important component of satellite security.\n³⁹³. Dong L.
