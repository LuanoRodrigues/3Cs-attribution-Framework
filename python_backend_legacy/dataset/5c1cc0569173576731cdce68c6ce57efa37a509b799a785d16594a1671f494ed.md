Live trackers record over 6 million cyberattacks daily. Information technology-dependent societies increasingly perceive cyber-threats as a destabilising force and citizens inevitably look to the State for protection. This paper concerns one form of State protection: whether States owe due diligence obligations in cyberspace under the laws of State responsibility. Specifically, it re-examines the contents of such an obligation and the circumstances which could trigger it in light of cyberattacks' peculiarities. A straightforward replication of due diligence models from international environmental law or law of the sea is not appropriate. But cyber-diligence should incorporate certain principles found within both models and channel ultimate responsibility for securing cyber-infrastructure onto private industry. Counter-terrorism obligations are the most useful body of law in which to seek an analogy. This paper argues that a State's cyber-diligence obligation is triggered, at a minimum, by: (1) constructive knowledge of a cyberattack, (2) which causes serious injury to an operating network. These contents and triggers define a cyber-diligence framework. Public pressure on the State and the market to intensify responses to transnational cyber-threats will drive the adoption of such principles.\nKeywords: Information Technology Law, Non-State Actors, Cyber War, National Security, Internet Governance.\nThis paper was initially written in partial fulfilment of my LLB at Monash University.

Meanwhile, the U.S. plane makes an emergency landing on Hainan Island. China detains twenty-four U.S. crew members for eleven days in a military base.²\nA Sino-U.S. “cyber-war” commences.³ U.S. hackers retaliate against the crew’s detention, defacing Chinese websites with messages including: “first you China men try and take our plane and crew . . . what is next? Our home land? Our freedom?”⁴ In response, “patriotic” Chinese hacktivists strike back. In a self-branded “cyber-operation defending our country,”⁵ hacktivists deface U.S. “.gov” and “.com” websites,⁶ leaving messages, including: “long live Chinese nationality!”⁷ Notably, the hacktivists on both sides were private actors, who rationalized their actions as legitimate patriotic demonstrations.⁸ This fact has led some to speculate that the Chinese government’s information warfare strategy includes “sponsoring” Chinese hacktivists.⁹ The terminology\n1.

Introduction\nCyberspace has “developed from [networks] of academic researchers into a mainstream communications mechanism.”¹⁶ Unfortunately, enhanced information flow results in the medium’s misuse. States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction.\nMany States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure.¹⁷ Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements.¹⁸ “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence”¹⁹ all work against custom crystallizing.²⁰ Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity\n16.

Obliging each State to take all available measures to stop cyberattacks which emanate from their territories would improve the security of interconnected networks globally.²¹\nArguably, to date, no cyberattack has risen to the level of a use of force. Aggrieved States have not invoked State responsibility for a failure to prevent injurious cyberattacks. Yet, live trackers record over six million cyberattacks daily,²² and fear of cyber insecurity has gripped the world.²³ States increasingly invest in cyber capabilities to protect against escalations in cyberattack severity,²⁴ with cyberspace militarisation widely forecasted.²⁵ Some commentators opine that cyber weapons are the next “weapon of choice” for terrorism.²⁶ This kind of event could propel a global uptake and strict application of cyber-diligence.

The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void.\nThe present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to \"peacetime\" cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack.²⁸ These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers.²⁹ Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State.\nFirst, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty. Cyber-diligence should be classified as an obligation of conduct. As the International Court of Justice (\"I.C.J.\") states: \"the obligation of States [is] to [employ] all means reasonably available to them\"³⁰ to prevent injurious activity.

Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts.\nThird, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network.\nFourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation. An objective standard of due diligence, defined through best-practice exchanges, could provide a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of States’ compliance.³³ But many States may not be\n³¹ Id.; James Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N.

States also have different capabilities to intervene in cyberspace. As a result, their capacity should limit their responsibility.³⁴\nCyberattacks transcend exclusive territorial control.³⁵ But the threat does not necessitate a reinvention of international law.³⁶ The proposed cyber-diligence framework preserves State-centric responsibility in cyberspace,³⁷ extending post-Westphalian sovereignty to a relatively Hobbesian environment (which is barely 20 years old).³⁸ The author is hopeful that the present paper can contribute to international law as a project of imposing and maintaining “order through words, whether at sea or on land . . . or indeed in cyberspace.”³⁹\n34.

THE PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF DUE DILIGENCE IN STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## A. Due Diligence derives from Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace⁴⁰\nDue diligence is a corollary of States’ equal sovereignty.⁴¹ States enjoy plenary jurisdiction to control objects and subjects within their territory,⁴² but must also “respect . . . the territorial sovereignty and political integrity” of others.⁴³ Flowing from States’ reciprocal respect, the I.C.J. famously articulated the due diligence obligation: “it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴ Due diligence, accordingly, has developed into a general principle of international law.⁴⁵\n40.

Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.⁶⁶\n## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty\nObligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States.⁶⁷ The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States.⁶⁸ In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence . . . into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”⁶⁹\n⁶².

First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks.⁷⁰ Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation.⁷¹ Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.”⁷² As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises.⁷³ The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”⁷⁴\nCyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”,⁷⁵ establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained . . . the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”⁷⁶\nThis paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature.⁷⁷ But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework.\n⁷⁰.

Cyber-Diligence should not adopt the Preventive Principle\nWe begin our examination with the preventive principle, a significant element within established due diligence models. The principle requires States to take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of transboundary damage where the risk is known.78 Preventive cyber-diligence would oblige States to create and maintain a clean infrastructural environment, in advance of any cyberattacks.79 We will not address the precautionary principle, which applies in the absence of scientific certainty that a risk will cause harm.80 It is settled that cyberattacks could cause serious injury.81\nSome commentators82—and a U.N. Working Group83—posit that States should undertake preventive cyber-diligence.84 The suggestions include:85\n78.

Monitoring suspicious activity.\nA number of these procedural steps constitute custom in international environmental law.[87] While these measures could obviate transboundary harm, they would do little to suppress ongoing or imminent cyberattacks. For instance, risk assessment identifies vulnerable networks. States could secure these networks, improve long-term network health, and make future cyberattacks harder to execute.[88] But risk assessment would do little to reduce injuries from a cyberattack that is underway. Hacktivists can launch attacks from infrastructure in States with lower cybersecurity,[89] diverting the source but not the effect of the eventual injury.[90] Another preventive measure could be to destroy malicious software (\"malware\") capable of being \"weaponized\" in a cyberattack. But nearly 200,000 new malware codes are identified daily.[91] The negligible effects of \"search and destroy\" operations do not warrant State expenditure.[92]\nPreventive measures are of minimal use when cyberattacks penetrate computer networks and cause instant injury. The territorial State should assist instead in the \"rescue effort\". They should engage skilled experts\nINCIDENTS: LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 60-61 (2010).\n86. See infra, III.B.3.\n87.

We shall demonstrate that a State's preventive duties should be confined to the circumstances in which it arose, transboundary environmental harm.⁹⁴\n## C. International Environmental Law\nThis subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence.\nScholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of \"noxious activity\" and prevention of \"information pollution.\"⁹⁵ The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the \"no harm\" principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas).⁹⁶ States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State.⁹⁷ In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed: \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory . . . to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another . . .\n⁹³.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of \"natural resources ... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the \"neighbouring State\" concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103\nWe dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State. A cyberattack can be directed from any distant location connected to the internet and traverse\n98. Trail Smelter (U.S. v. Can.), 3 R.I.A.A. 1905, 1950 (Mixed Claims Comm'n 1938, 1941).\n99.

Cyberspace, still in its infancy, has seemingly infinite resources.¹⁰⁹ Permanent cyberspace degradation is not an issue: servers can be restored after attacks and security breaches can be repaired. At worst, physical infrastructure and data destroyed in a cyberattack still would not affect the overall functioning of the cyberspace domain.\nStates have no impetus to restrict private actors from \"polluting\" cyberspace. The \"tragedy of the commons\" theory reasons that \"we are locked into a system of fouling our own nest\".¹¹⁰ This is because the cost of the waste \"[a person] discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying [her] wastes.\"¹¹¹ We do not foul the cyberspace \"nest\" because no amount of \"cyberwaste\" can (currently) overload and inhibit cyberspace functions. The medium fosters independent gain without fear of endangering the cyberspace platform.\nThe \"polluter pays\" principle should be applied to shift the duty of prevention onto private industry. (This should sit alongside States criminalising cyber-offences for individual liability.) As Alan Boyle suggests, \"it may be simpler, quicker, and economically more efficient to make polluters . . . pay rather than States.\"¹¹² State regulations should\n¹⁰⁵.

The \"cyber-polluter\" should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable.\nSecond, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to \"threat intelligence\" companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence, \"cyber-pollution\" should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126]\nDirecting a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for \"cyber-pollution\" incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability. Consumer perception of network owners' cyber vulnerability could result in reputational and stock-price hits. The\n45, entered into force May 30, 1996.\n121.

First, a private liability regime could dilute State responsibility, moving questions of cyber-diligence from public international law into private international law.¹²⁹ The principle risks “exonerating certain subjects of international law from their share of responsibility for damage” caused by cyberattacks.¹³⁰\nSecond, civil liability does “not always [guarantee] real compensation for the damage caused to the environment.”¹³¹ A compensation scheme does not rectify the damage already caused to networks. To counter this inadequacy, States ought to take positive steps to terminate cyberattacks that are in progress and mitigate injury as far as possible. They should also bear cooperation duties to help restore injured networks post-cyberattack.¹³²\nIn limited State practice, victim States readily initiate prosecution under domestic criminal laws after they ascertain a hacker’s identity. In 2007, cyberattacks targeted Estonia’s government websites, e-services, and information infrastructure after Estonia removed a Soviet-era memorial.¹³³ Attack methods included denial of service (“DOS”),¹³⁴\n¹²⁷.

As is taken up later, cyberspace, unlike the high seas, is not a res communis. An analogy with the marine environment also impractically extends the scope of cyber-diligence obligations to nationals outside territorial control. But it provides guidance for an adequate regulatory framework in cyber-diligence.\n## D. International Law of the Sea\nPart XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"UNCLOS\") enshrines States' due diligence obligations within the marine environment. Article 192 establishes the general obligation to \"protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁴ Under Article 193, States enjoy the sovereign right to exploit natural resources, but must also take measures to prevent pollution to the marine environment.¹⁴⁵\nSeveral differences arise when applying due diligence obligations in the marine environment compared to cyberspace. First, due diligence obligations under UNCLOS do not exclusively attach to sovereignty.¹⁴⁶ Vessels may operate in areas where States enjoy mutual rights. Articles 192 and 193 oblige flag States to ensure conservation of living resources, including in the exclusive economic zones of other States.¹⁴⁷ To discharge this obligation, flag States ought to ensure vessels within their jurisdiction and control \"do not undermine [their] obligations . . . to protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁸ The arbitral\n¹⁴⁴.

A State’s cyber-diligence obligation should not extend to terminating a cyberattack initiated by a national abroad.¹⁵² In the sea, a flag vessel’s physical location is identifiable. A State’s due diligence obligation follows their flag vessels’ chartered territory. In cyberspace, a State exercises authority over infrastructure within their exclusive control both in their territory and extraterritorially.¹⁵³ But a State’s jurisdictional control of their nationals assumes different characteristics.

In this situation, besides a duty of cooperation to assist a victim State's investigations of their national, State A should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation to terminate the cyberattack.\nSeparately, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea's (\"ITLOS\") Seabed Disputes Advisory Opinion articulates internal laws and regulations which States ought to adopt to fulfil due diligence obligations.[156] UNCLOS places due diligence obligations on States who engage contractors for projects within international waters (sponsoring States).[157] Sponsoring States are required to \"[adopt] laws\n155.

These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases.  |\n|  (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity.  |\nLiu\nThese measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State,¹⁶¹ and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity.\nCyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured.\nInternational cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked.\n## E. An Assessment of International Cooperation in Cyberspace¹⁶²\nCurrently, two trends in cybersecurity cooperation can be observed:\n1.

For example, a bilateral agreement between Russia and Estonia enshrined “obligations” to transfer evidence, assist in investigations, and extradite alleged perpetrators of criminal offences.¹⁶⁹ In spite of this, Russia refused to assist Estonia’s investigations after the 2007 cyberattacks. Russia’s interpretation of the treaty excluded surveillance measures identifying a perpetrator’s physical location.¹⁷⁰ A restrictive interpretation conceals, perhaps, a lack of cooperative will.¹⁷¹ Some States possibly favour a poorly regulated cyberspace.¹⁷² States can leverage assistance to gain traction with allies, or refuse\nTY PLANNING (2016), http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Security-Planning/; EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY, EUROPEAN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENCE (EP3R) (2009) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies; German Federal Office for Information Security, IT-Grundschutz (2016), https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/; Shackleford, supra note 20, at 29.\n¹⁶⁵.

States should commission cybersecurity experts,[175] and:\n1. deploy their experts to secure critical (and vulnerable) networks domestically, reducing the risk of cyberattacks emanating from their territory; and\n2. in the event of an ongoing cyberattack, mobilize these experts in real-time to instantly upgrade network security.\nExperts could be exchanged between contracting agencies within cooperating States.[176] Each State could mobilize experts from multiple jurisdictions if cyberattacks occurred or if their private sector demanded increased protection. States with cyber-monitoring capabilities may warn others, in advance, of increased malicious traffic indicating imminent cyberattack(s).[177] A target State can then boost network capacity in anticipation. In ongoing cyberattacks, assisting States may host servers, transfer bandwidth, and eliminate botnet traffic.\nBut these suggestions remain aspirational. First, duties to co-operate are obligations of conduct \"formulated in a relatively weak way,\"[178] which do not drive outcomes.

However, a central consultative body that facilitates cooperation could spark increases in cyber-diligence capacity. We turn to counter-terrorism for direction. The next subsection defines the similarities between cyberattacks and terrorism and argues that cyber-diligence should resemble Resolution 1373's counter-terrorism model of due diligence. Adoption of this model would be conditional on an event which heightens expectations of States' compliance with cyber-diligence obligations.\n196.

Prevention of Transnational Terrorism\n## 1. Introduction\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks share parallels. The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed.²⁰² We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\"²⁰³ A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.²⁰⁴\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats.²⁰⁵ These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law.²⁰⁶ They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory.²⁰⁷ Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n²⁰² Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear . . . to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.”²⁰⁸ A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.²⁰⁹\n## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison\nInternational law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network”²¹⁰ without a formal hierarchy.²¹¹ Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”.²¹² Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.²¹³\nAnonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.”²¹⁴ The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream,\n208. *Id.* at 114.\n209.

Its \"ops\" begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to \"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling \"anons\" into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites.²¹⁶ In 2012, \"anons\" initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline. \"Operation Anti-ACTA\" responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.²¹⁷ Anonymous proclaimed that the agreement \"[enslaves] the internet.\"²¹⁸ While the government website was down, Polish politicians opposed to the agreement wore Guy Fawkes masks (the symbol of the Anonymous movement) in Parliament.²¹⁹\nPrivate actors domiciled across different States accomplish Al-Qaeda and Anonymous' \"successes\". They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.\n215. D.C.

The obligation existed within custom and conventions well before 9/11.²²⁰ However, this paper focuses on the counter-terrorism standard of due diligence established within Resolution 1373.\nIn handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.”²²¹ States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.”²²² The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.²²³\nResolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations.²²⁴ States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation).²²⁵ These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security,²²⁶ which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.²²⁷\n²²⁰.

First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks.\n## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision\nResolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures.²³⁰ The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies,²³¹ and does not enforce sanctions on those who \"fail\" to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment.\nThe U.N. General Assembly has established the Group of Governmental Experts in Information Security (\"G.G.E.\"), signalling an intention to centralise cybersecurity efforts.²³² The Group outlines\nInternational Terrorism, in Bianchi &amp; Naqvi eds, supra note 26, at 83-92; see also SUNSTEIN, supra note 85, at 123.\n228.

The C.D.C's overall goal should be to assist (particularly developing) States building capacity to prevent cyberattacks. A gradual improvement in capacity throughout all 191 U.N. member States could decrease the frequency of cyberattacks, although this will take time, and requires ample financial resources.²³⁵\nThe C.D.C's specific functions should resemble those of the C.T.C.: appoint experts to advise States on cyber-diligence compliance,²³⁶ coordinate assistance between donors and donees,²³⁷ and elicit compulsory written reports on States' capacity building measures. A C.D.C. reduces the discretion of States to determine appropriate measures for cyber-diligence. Through reviews, the C.D.C. should implicitly set a due diligence standard for States to meet in acquiring capacity. A C.D.C. should stress the relative nature of cyber-diligence and not stretch the obligation into one of absolute prevention.²³⁸ (It should centralize responsibility for co-ordinating cyber-diligence efforts, but preserve due diligence as an obligation of conduct.)\n233.

It risks creating a disparity between States' reported capacity and their actual exercise of that capacity.²³⁹ Unresolved tensions include:\n1. whether the C.D.C. should impose effective enforcement mechanisms, or respect State decisions on internal social, economic, and political matters;²⁴⁰ and\n2. how the C.D.C. should determine which States: (i) do not have a genuine capacity to acquire or execute cyber-diligence (unable but willing), and; which States (ii) have the capacity (in reality) to exercise cyber-diligence, but decline to do so (able but unwilling).²⁴¹\nIn the counter-terrorism context, Tal Becker proposes that due diligence standards should apply to a State:\n1. acquiring the (legal, administrative, and resource) capacity to meet their due diligence obligations, and;\n2. “[employing] its capabilities with due diligence”.²⁴²\nBecker’s proposed standards should be incorporated into States’ cyber-diligence obligations. The C.D.C. should supervise States’ compliance with limb (1). States who fail to notify the C.D.C. of their capacity deficits should be disentitled from pleading a lack of capacity if a subsequent cyberattack implicates their networks.²⁴³ This approach limits the responsibility of unable but willing States for a particular cyberattack, provided they have fulfilled limb (1) to the extent of their capacity. Other domestic exigencies may militate against\n²³⁹. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128.\n²⁴⁰. U.N. Charter art. 2(7).\n²⁴¹.

However, difficulties arise where *able but unwilling* States exercise cyber-diligence “half-heartedly”. For instance, a State could neutralise a third of the total botnets emanating from their territory (when they have the capacity to terminate the entire cyberattack).²⁴⁵ To establish violation, the victim State ought to prove that the territorial State did not employ their full capacity to prevent the cyberattack.²⁴⁶\nThere is no “quick fix” to these tensions. Nonetheless, a C.D.C. should introduce an internationally calibrated strategy to capacity building in cyber-diligence. Far from being merely theoretical, 159 States have received counter-terrorism assistance as a result of the C.T.C.²⁴⁷ A C.D.C. realises the UN’s role of equipping States with the *capacity for* cyber-diligence,²⁴⁸ but not overstepping its intergovernmental character to intervene in States’ actual exercise of cyber-diligence.²⁴⁹\nThis section argues that the contents of a State’s cyber-diligence obligation should include: (1) the “cyber-polluter pays” principle; (2) implementing regulations for industry to secure infrastructure, and; (3) capacity-building via consultation with the C.D.C. But States ought to know what circumstances enliven their obligation to fulfil these contents. The following section considers the two key triggers of cyber-diligence obligations: knowledge and injury.\n244. TRAPP, *supra* note 63, at 79.\n245.

Does Actual or Constructive Knowledge Trigger Cyber-Diligence?\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, a sovereign's responsibility for their subjects' actions consists of \"forbearance\" and \"protection shewn to transgressions.\"²⁵⁰ The sovereign must: (1) know of the transgression and; (2) fail to prevent or punish the delinquency.\nKnowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility.²⁵¹ States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it.²⁵² Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury.²⁵³ There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion.²⁵⁴ A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.²⁵⁵\nThis paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:\n250.

A botnet is \"a network of compromised computers.\" \"The bots\" are remotely controlled by the \"botherder\" and conduct coordinated cyber operations. There is no limit on the number of bots that can be \"recruited\". See Schmitt ed., supra note 25, at 257; COMMITTEE ON OFFENSIVE INFORMATION WARFARE, supra note 25, at 89.\n254. But see, infra IV.3.b.\n255. Unless the state itself launched the cyberattack, a fact that is exceedingly difficult to prove.\n232\nLiu\n1. Actual knowledge: a State knows of a cyberattack (where a State organ conducts the cyberattack);\n2. Conniance: a State wilfully shuts their eyes to the obvious occurrence of a cyberattack (for example, after detecting the cyberattack or being notified of it);²⁵⁶\n3. Objective evidence leads to a logical conclusion that:\n- a State ought to have known of a cyberattack, or;\n- a State had information on a cyberattack, and was obliged to undertake further inquiries, but failed to do so;\n4. In the event a C.D.C. is adopted, States bear a heightened duty of vigilance to identify and eliminate threats within their territory.²⁵⁷ Constructive knowledge and an obligation to undertake further inquiries are built into this duty.\nCategories (1) – (2) constitute subjective knowledge, while categories (3) – (4) amount to constructive (objective) knowledge. First, we demonstrate that all four categories should suffice to trigger cyber-diligence. Second, we suggest an appropriate standard of proof to establish a territorial State’s knowledge before an international court or tribunal (“international tribunal”).\n## 1. Subjective Knowledge is Difficult to Establish\n### i. Categories 1 and 2\nSubjective knowledge is the highest degree of intent. A State either intended the cyberattack to cause serious injury, or endorsed the outcome. In judicial proceedings, victim States may struggle to establish a territorial State’s actual knowledge or connivance. The accused State’s sovereignty shrouds any evidence of subjective knowledge in secrecy. It is unthinkable that an accused State would surrender documents\n²⁵⁶.

Iran was \"fully aware . . . of the urgent need for action,\"²⁶⁰ given \"repeated calls for help\" to the Iranian Foreign Ministry.²⁶¹ Iran's inaction was \"due to more than mere negligence or lack of appropriate means.\"²⁶²\nHowever, victim States rarely notify territorial States of a cyberattack. Notification consumes time, does little to reduce injury, and tarnishes inter-State relations. Instead, a State will likely devote their resources to withstanding a cyberattack. In the Estonian incident, botnet infiltrations implicated computers in 178 countries.²⁶³ Estonia did not notify one territorial State. Instead, Estonia increased bandwidth capacity (so networks could handle increased traffic), filtered malicious transmissions, and engaged U.S. and N.A.T.O. assistance to terminate sources of the attack.²⁶⁴ Some territorial States voluntarily neutralized sources of attacks.²⁶⁵\nIn 2008, Georgia and Russia engaged in armed conflict over the South Ossetia region. Georgia suffered concurrent cyberattacks on their governmental, commercial and media networks, (supposedly) coordinated via Russian infrastructure.²⁶⁶ Georgia, a \"cyber-locked\" State, relied on neighbouring States' cyber infrastructure to facilitate\n258.

Victim States mitigate loss and boost defences when a cyberattack begins. Politically allied States disable attack sources and offer relief networks.²⁷² Victim States do not benefit from notification.\nThe knowledge threshold to trigger cyber-diligence should be lowered. Kimberley Trapp argues (in the counter-terrorism context): \"requiring proof of subjective knowledge would effectively act as a bar to any finding of responsibility for a failure to prevent.\"²⁷³ A territorial State's cyber-diligence obligation should be triggered if they \"ought to have known\" of a cyberattack.\n## 2. Constructive Knowledge Should Trigger Cyber-Diligence Obligations\n### i. Category 3\nInternational jurisprudence supports constructive knowledge triggering due diligence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J's majority judgment relied on a series of inferences to conclude that the minefield laying \"could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of Albania.\"²⁷⁴ The majority inferred Albania's knowledge according to objective standards.\n²⁶⁷.

Corfu Channel, supra note 44, at 19-20.\nLiu\nThe U.K. was not required to prove Albania knew (subjectively) of the mines' presence.²⁷⁵ Notably, two dissentients (Judge Azevedo and Judge Krylov) held Albania was under a continuous duty to inform itself of reasonably foreseeable threats in its territory,²⁷⁶ or, as Ian Brownlie argues, “[to] take reasonable care to discover activities of trespassers.”²⁷⁷\nIn the Bosnian Genocide case, the I.C.J. found that a State’s obligation to prevent the occurrence of genocide is engaged “at the instant that the State learns of, or should normally have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.”²⁷⁸ Engaging the obligation to prevent genocide is tantamount to triggering cyber-diligence if the State should have reasonably known of the attack’s occurrence.²⁷⁹\nIn Asian Agricultural Products, the Tribunal emphasized Sri Lanka bore a duty to exercise “[an] ‘objective’ standard of vigilance in assessing the required degree of protection and security . . . for foreign investors.”²⁸⁰ The language of these cases suggest that constructive knowledge should be established if the territorial State had information that a cyberattack might occur and failed to conduct further inquiries.\nElsewhere, some commentators argue constructive knowledge should be presumed when a cyberattack implicates a State’s exclusive governmental infrastructure.²⁸¹ The aggrieved State ought to establish that the attack travelled through the territorial State’s governmental infrastructure.²⁸² Constructive knowledge is prima facie established if the infrastructure was under direct State control and used only for\n275.

Indications of government infrastructure's involvement in a cyberattack can be deceiving. First, non-State hackers may compromise a government server.284 A cyberattack being mounted from government infrastructure does not in itself establish responsibility in the cyber context.285\nSecond, cyberattacks are often dressed with \"spoofing\" (identify manipulation) techniques. In the Estonian incident, spoofing clouded evidence which incriminated Moscow's exclusive infrastructure: unknown perpetrators could have adopted the veil of a Moscow government computer.286 Often, \"onion routing\" techniques are used to conceal perpetrators' identity.287 The majority of cyberattacks use such masquerading tactics.288 Even if network logs suggest a cyberattack exploited government infrastructure, the victim State should still be bound to adduce evidence to dismiss spoofing concerns.\nSome commentators stretch the presumption of constructive knowledge further. They advocate a reverse presumptio juris whenever a cyberattack is associated with government infrastructure,289 or when \"injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State.\"290 International tribunals would shift the burden of proof onto the territorial State, who must disprove their presumed constructive knowledge.291\n283.

Territorial control does not “[shift] the burden of proof . . . in relation to unlawful acts perpetrated therein.”²⁹³ In Pulp Mills, the I.C.J. stated “a preventive approach . . . does not [operate] as a reversal of the burden of proof.”²⁹⁴ It is not for the territorial State to prove its diligence. State control over governmental networks only gives rise to “abstract and immaterial knowledge” of a cyberattack, insufficient to presume State responsibility.²⁹⁵\nBut victim States may use the accused State's control over government infrastructure as evidence. Section IV.A.3. explains how a pattern of such evidence should establish constructive knowledge. But first, we examine how constructive knowledge would operate under category 4.\n## ii. Category 4\nWith reference to Section III.F.3., should a C.D.C. framework be established, a degree of constructive knowledge should be presumed. Territorial States would be held to a standard of vigilance in maintaining their cyber-territory, and constructive knowledge of an ongoing or imminent attack would be imputed to these States. States would have less latitude to plead a lack of capacity to discover a particular cyberattack.\nPresuming knowledge would reflect heightened expectations for State compliance with cyber-diligence obligations.²⁹⁶ The victim State still bears the burden of proof²⁹⁷ and should establish knowledge\n292.

Overcoming the Evidentiary Hurdle: Standard of Proof\nTypically, a failure in due diligence will be raised after the victim State (“applicant”) suffers injury. The issue turns to causation. How does the applicant gather sufficient evidence to establish that actual or constructive knowledge triggered the territorial State’s (“respondent”) cyber-diligence obligation?²⁹⁸ The applicant will struggle to establish their case absent the respondent’s assistance or at least consent to evidence collection.²⁹⁹\nThe I.C.J. acknowledges that victim States face evidentiary difficulties, allowing a “more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence . . . provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.”³⁰⁰ But the standard of proof in an international tribunal should not be lowered “simply because it is . . . difficult to reach.”³⁰¹ The standard “[protects] the respondent against false attribution . . . a particularly serious risk in the cyber context.”³⁰²\nThe applicant must produce reliable and neutral evidence to establish that the respondent at least ought to have known of the cyberattack.³⁰³ They could rely on experts to adduce logs of the respondent’s network behaviour during the cyberattack.³⁰⁴ An international tribunal may\nOF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE: A COMMENTARY 1245 (Andreas Zimmermann et al. eds, 2012).\n298.

It also incentivizes States to secure (at least) their governmental infrastructure. But the approach does not prejudice States who lack the capacity to safeguard their governmental infrastructure.³²⁰\nQuestions of a State's actual or constructive knowledge are contingent on a judicial forum's evidentiary standards. Together, they form the \"knowledge\" element to trigger cyber-diligence obligations. A threshold of constructive knowledge proven to a clear and convincing standard has been advanced. This paper now turns to the second trigger-element: injury.\n## B. What Level of Injury Engages A Cyber-Diligence Duty?\nInjury is not a pre-requisite to finding an internationally wrongful act under the laws of State responsibility.³²¹ Once a breach is attributed to a State, responsibility is potentially engaged, subject to application of the primary rule.³²² In the context of due diligence, however, damage is a condition to finding a violation of the primary rule.³²³ A State who failed to exercise cyber-diligence is only liable for breaching the primary rule after hostile acts, contrary to another State's legal rights, occur.³²⁴ When \"due diligence is violated, there is an attribution to the State . . . of the consequences of the acts of [private] persons.\"³²⁵\n³²⁰.

Cyber-diligence obligations \"re-establish the status quo erat.\"³²⁹ With that in mind, this section defines \"serious injury\" to trigger States' cyber-diligence obligations.\nThe Tallinn Manual defines an \"unlawful [cyber] act\" as \"all cyber activities from one State's territory that affect the rights of other States [producing] a negative effect.\"³³⁰ The definition covers any operation affecting \"sovereignty\": a lower level of injury compared to an act of interference³³¹ or armed force.³³²\nHowever, when is \"a negative effect\" of sufficient gravity to trigger cyber-diligence? Jurisprudence and the literature establish a context-dependent standard of serious injury. In *Trail Smelter*, the arbitral tribunal stated \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury . . . when the case is of serious consequence.\"³³³ Some commentators state that \"serious injury\" triggers the duty, without further explanation.³³⁴ The Tallinn Manual ambiguously concludes that \"physical damage to objects or injuries to\n³²⁶.

The concept does not define what measures a State should take during the occurrence of the injury. In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.³³⁶\nThis paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories.³³⁷ We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation. The types of injury listed are non-exhaustive, but represent differing levels of severity.\n## 1. Injury to Persons or Loss of Life; Physical Damage or Destruction of Objects\nCyberattacks which cause physical damage equivalent to conventional attacks could constitute armed force or armed attack (when launched by a State).³³⁸ While discussions of *jus ad bellum* are beyond this paper’s scope, several observations should be made.\nFirst, category 1 represents cyberattack injury of the highest severity. Any physical harm to persons or objects would trigger a territorial State’s cyber-diligence obligation.³³⁹ But it is very rare for a cyberattack to cause category 1 damage.

Some argue that attacks on critical national infrastructure (such as water supply and electricity grids) would likely lead to secondary consequences of physical injury to persons and objects.³⁴⁰ An attack on one critical network has a “synergistic effect,”³⁴¹ propagating injury to other connected physical infrastructures.\nSuch conclusions need to be balanced. The scale and duration of a cyberattack and the effectiveness of the target State’s response determines the likelihood of category 1 injuries. In 2015, for the first time, a cyberattack struck an electricity grid, in Ukraine. The attackers hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) systems in seven substations,³⁴² disconnecting power to 225,000 Ukrainians for three hours. Some had anticipated an “electronic Pearl Harbour” once a cyberattack hits an electric grid.³⁴³ This did not occur. The Ukrainian energy providers shifted to manual operations and restored electricity quickly. No physical damage to infrastructure occurred.³⁴⁴\nSecond, as yet, only State organs are equipped and motivated to inflict material injury using cyber-offensive capabilities.³⁴⁵ Such a cyberattack would automatically be considered an act of the State.³⁴⁶ Liability turns on attribution and the breach of an international\n340.

A State may forego invoking intermediary cyber-diligence breaches if the injury is serious, preferring to treat it instead as armed force or armed attack so as to enliven jus ad bellum. Non-State hacktivists rarely (if ever) cause physical injury. Hackers instead inundate networks with DDOS attacks or implant malware and extract information.[347]\nThird, no reported cyberattack has yet caused injury to persons or loss of life.[348] Some have come close: hackers infiltrated a hospital network and lethally altered a patient's dosages, only to be discovered by a nurse before the drug was administered.[349] Debate exists about whether the 2010 Stuxnet virus actually caused physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.[350] Stuxnet took control of SCADA networks, manipulated data and controlled the processing speed of centrifuges. One commentator argues that the injury suffered was a mere usurpation of the SCADA networks and not injury to the physical integrity of the centrifuges.[351] Apart from Stuxnet, to date, we have been unable to identify a single cyberattack which has caused physical damage to a network's physical components and not merely destroying data or incapacitating network functions.[352]\nCyberattacks overloaded and temporarily suspended networks in the Estonian and Georgian incidents.[353] But, despite social and economic disruptions, no network reportedly suffered destructive or permanent\n347.

A rigid requirement of physical damage or destruction (perhaps more suited to conventional attacks) $^{354}$  is inappropriate for cyber-diligence. The cyber-diligence obligation prevents injury to cyber networks and infrastructure. A lower level of damage should also trigger cyber-diligence. One commentator notes: \"the dependency of modern societies on [computer] networks has made it possible to incapacitate physical infrastructures without destroying them.\" $^{355}$\n# 2. Loss of Network Functionality $^{356}$\nMost cyberattack methods disrupt target networks. Cyberattacks could overwhelm a network with botnet requests, cause system malfunction, or otherwise degrade the quality of network services.[357] Herbert Lin distinguishes between a (destructive) \"cyberattack\" and a (non-destructive) \"cyber-exploitation\".[358] The former renders a network unavailable, or undermines the network's integrity, without destroying any physical components.[359] For instance, DDOS attacks on Estonian infrastructure temporarily reduced accessibility to crucial services in the financial, telecommunications, media, and government sectors.[360] The attack significantly hindered the ability to conduct financial transactions, resulting in losses to industry and Estonian citizens.[361]\nThis paper argues that once a cyberattack causes serious disruptions to a network's proper functioning, the cyberattack is then \"destructive\",\n354.

Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries.\nSecondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack.³⁶⁷ The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm.³⁶⁸ Due diligence standards change according to “new scientific or technological knowledge [and] risks involved in the activity.”³⁶⁹ Primary injury to\n362.

Cyber-Exploitations\nThe third category of \"injury\" results from stealthily executed cyber activities, unknown the victim. \"Cyber-exploitation\" describes an activity intended to clandestinely access and exploit a network's vulnerabilities without disturbing the network's operation.³⁷² Intelligence gathering operations most frequently cause this \"injury\".³⁷³ Hackers emplace malware into a network to collect information for economic or political purposes. Cyber-exploitations could also probe a network for vulnerabilities in preparation for future cyberattacks.³⁷⁴\nThe term \"injury\" is hesitantly used to refer to category (3). It is unclear what injury cyber-exploitation actually causes to a victim State. \"[An] infringement of rights or legally protected interests\" activates cyber-diligence obligations.³⁷⁵ The question turns on whether peacetime cyber-exploitation infringes a target State's territorial sovereignty.³⁷⁶\nArguably, covert cyber-exploitations which intrude on a network and extract data violate the \"honor, dignity or prestige of a State\"³⁷⁷\n370.

Cyber-Vandalism, Irritation and Computer Crime\nThe Tallinn Manual regards \"mere irritation or inconvenience\" as not of sufficient seriousness to trigger cyber-diligence.³⁸⁷ Low-intensity cyber-vandalism does not cause serious disruption to a State and is appropriately classified as a domestic cybercrime under the Budapest Convention.³⁸⁸ 85% to 97% of all cybercrimes are not revealed let alone prosecuted.³⁸⁹ Such laxity in enforcement demonstrates States' passive tolerance of low-intensity cybercrimes.³⁹⁰ To counter \"close to unlimited\" instances of cyber-vandalism,³⁹¹ States should improve domestic cybercrime regulation and dedicate cyber-diligence resources to preventing higher categories of injury.\nMarco Roscini argues that defacement alters computer data and should be characterized as a disruptive cyberattack (category 2\n385.

But unlike “destructive” cyberattacks, defacement merely causes superficial injuries to a network. Hacktivists intend to transmit unwanted political messages, not to overthrow a regime.³⁹⁴ *Oppenheim’s International Law* notes that due diligence obligations do not extend to “suppress[ing] criticism of, or propaganda directed against, other States or governments on the part of private persons.”³⁹⁵ Roscini himself recognizes that defacement is “relatively innocuous [and] psychological.”³⁹⁶ Cyber-diligence should not “imply an obligation to suppress all such conduct [inimical to] the regime or policy of a foreign State.”³⁹⁷\nDespite the difficulties of retrospectively evaluating “serious injury”, this threshold reflects States’ concerns about cyberattacks which disable infrastructural operations. Under our formulation, cyber-exploitation and defacement fall below the threshold. States would likely avoid burdensome cyber-diligence for cyber activity of low-intensity, largely tolerated internationally.\nThe final section outlines hypothetical cyberattack scenarios and explores whether best-practice exchanges could set an implicit standard of cyber-diligence.\n392.

ASSESSING BREACH OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\nThe preceding sections define the contents and triggers of cyber-diligence obligations. This paper now discusses violation of the primary obligation.\nBreach of the primary obligation fastens on a State's knowledge, capacity to prevent, and the level of injury caused. Pierre-Marie Dupuy states: \"the true breach of an obligation of conduct is the breach of an obligation to behave (in a legally defined way).\"³⁹⁸ The accusing State needs to establish that they would not have suffered injury, or would have suffered less injury, if the accused State exercised cyber-diligence. Injury is not the decisive element. Breach is evaluated according to whether, at the origin of the injury, a State failed to do all it could to prevent the end result.³⁹⁹ As soon as a territorial State does not take all appropriate measures to stop a cyberattack, the cyber-diligence obligation has been violated.⁴⁰⁰\nThe obligation, articulated in theory, does not capture the infinite scenarios which may arise in practice, including when:⁴⁰¹\n1. A lesser-able State puts their limited capacity to diligent use, doing all they can to stop a cyberattack.\n2. A State has sound cyber-capabilities in general, but is \"resource-poor\" at the time of the cyberattack. The State may have allocated intense resources to other priorities and is unable to terminate the cyberattack.\n3. A State with sound cyber-capabilities, both generally and at the time of a cyberattack, decides not to terminate the cyberattack.\n³⁹⁸. Dupuy, supra note 69, at 379.\n³⁹⁹.

BECKER, supra note 202, at 151-52.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n253\nLiu\nThese situations are highly abstract and all presuppose that a State has requisite knowledge and that the cyberattack causes serious injury. Variable factors across these situations determine breach. Assessment of breach ought to be “realistic and context-sensitive,”⁴⁰² particularized to the circumstances in question. Theoretically, the State in situation (1) has exercised cyber-diligence to the extent of their capabilities, satisfying the obligation. The State in situation (3) has, by contrast, failed to do all it could to stop the cyberattack, and breaches their obligation. Situation (2) is less clear: international law does not dictate States’ domestic resource-allocation.⁴⁰³\nIn reality, establishing responsibility is not straightforward. To evade responsibility, an accused State could claim:\n1. they exercised their best efforts, yet still failed to achieve a result in the face of new cyberattack methods;\n2. a lack of capacity at the time of a cyberattack, given other exigencies;⁴⁰⁴ or\n3. they lacked sufficient knowledge of the cyberattacks.\nThe accusing State then bears the unenviable burden of establishing breach.\nPredicting a breach of cyber-diligence with confidence is difficult. First, there is no minimum standard of cyber-diligence to measure compliance against.⁴⁰⁵ Second, a State’s acquiescence to a cyberattack is also likely to be covert and publicly denied.⁴⁰⁶ Third, cyber-diligence is a “moveable target”, constantly evolving as cyberspace technology develops.⁴⁰⁷\n402.

S.C. Resolution 1377 invited the C.T.C. to promote counter-terrorism best-practice and prepare model laws.⁴¹⁰ A C.D.C. could do the same, and implicitly define an expected standard of care for cyber-diligence between member States.\nBest Management Practices (\"BMPs\") in counter-piracy provide a useful example of the best-practices approach to solving problems. Devised by the International Marine Organisation and the shipping industry, the BMPs increased vessels' successful resistance to piracy by 25%.⁴¹¹ Adopting these self-help recommendations (including such matters as speed, security equipment, and watchkeeping) were in the vessels' best interests. Compliance minimized insurance premiums and decreased the probability of pirate capture.⁴¹²\nThere is no guarantee that adopting and disseminating best-practice will achieve these results for cyber-diligence. Cyber-powers or private industries must be willing to share their (actual) best-practices before any dialogue improves cyber-diligence capabilities.

Cyber-infrastructure now underpins many of the essential features of a modern society. Cyberspace pervades our lives and the dangers of its ill-use are publicly recognized. Citizens reap the benefits of cyber-technology, at the same time expecting governments to shield them from transnational cyber-threats.⁴¹⁹\nOn interconnected threats, the U.N. Secretary General has remarked: “we must found a new security consensus, the first article of which must be that . . . whatever threatens one threatens all.”⁴²⁰ Indeed, cyber-technology disregards political and cultural borders and grants unlimited reach to private actors. But there is no need to panic.\n415. Jason Fritz, *How China will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness*, 8 CULT. MANDALA 28 (2008).\n416. Czosseck, *supra* note 9, at 16.\n417.

It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an \"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\" of serious consequences from a cyberattack.⁴²² Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example.⁴²³ Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects. \"Serious attacks\" affecting network functionality are few and far between. But the Estonian and Georgian incidents demonstrate that they can occur.\nAt a minimum, to establish breaches of cyber-diligence, the victim\n⁴²¹. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 226.\n⁴²².

It is hoped that the framework matches States' concerns in practice and can guide their cybersecurity policies. Beijing and Washington, from our opening example, should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation in relation to defacement of each other's websites. Even if constructive knowledge can be established, the hacktivism did not cause injury of the requisite threshold to trigger the obligation.\nCyber-diligence will continue to be debated within academia before States employ relevant measures. It is hoped that this paper contributes a balanced response to the present scholarship.\nIV Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 191-260 (April 2017)\n258\nLiu\n# Footnotes from table in section III.D.\n1.

Live trackers record over 6 million cyberattacks daily. Information technology-dependent societies increasingly perceive cyber-threats as a destabilising force and citizens inevitably look to the State for protection. This paper concerns one form of State protection: whether States owe due diligence obligations in cyberspace under the laws of State responsibility. Specifically, it re-examines the contents of such an obligation and the circumstances which could trigger it in light of cyberattacks' peculiarities. A straightforward replication of due diligence models from international environmental law or law of the sea is not appropriate. But cyber-diligence should incorporate certain principles found within both models and channel ultimate responsibility for securing cyber-infrastructure onto private industry. Counter-terrorism obligations are the most useful body of law in which to seek an analogy. This paper argues that a State's cyber-diligence obligation is triggered, at a minimum, by: (1) constructive knowledge of a cyberattack, (2) which causes serious injury to an operating network. These contents and triggers define a cyber-diligence framework. Public pressure on the State and the market to intensify responses to transnational cyber-threats will drive the adoption of such principles.\nKeywords: Information Technology Law, Non-State Actors, Cyber War, National Security, Internet Governance.\nThis paper was initially written in partial fulfilment of my LLB at Monash University.

CASE STUDY: “PATRIOTIC” HACKTIVISTS\nIn April 2001, a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet collide over the South China Sea. The Chinese F-8 crashes, killing its pilot. Meanwhile, the U.S. plane makes an emergency landing on Hainan Island. China detains twenty-four U.S. crew members for eleven days in a military base.\nA Sino-U.S. “cyber-war” commences. U.S. hackers retaliate against the crew’s detention, defacing Chinese websites with messages including: “first you China men try and take our plane and crew . . . what is next? Our home land? Our freedom?” In response, “patriotic” Chinese hacktivists strike back. In a self-branded “cyber-operation defending our country,” hacktivists deface U.S. “.gov” and “.com” websites, leaving messages, including: “long live Chinese nationality!” Notably, the hacktivists on both sides were private actors, who rationalized their actions as legitimate patriotic demonstrations. This fact has led some to speculate that the Chinese government’s information warfare strategy includes “sponsoring” Chinese hacktivists. The terminology\n1.

But attribution is only one possible test of State responsibility.\nWhat is a State's responsibility for its own actions or inaction during these cyberattacks? A due diligence obligation in cyberspace (\"cyber-diligence\"), if established, would offer victim States alternative legal recourse for a territorial State's breach of a primary obligation. Subject to the contents and triggers of the obligation defined below, China and the U.S. could invoke one another's responsibility for failing to prevent hacktivism within their territories. The failure could constitute an internationally wrongful act, which would then enable either State to seek reparations.\nThe present paper uses hacktivism as its opening case study to canvass the issue of State responsibility in cyberattacks. We now turn to examine, starting from first principles, the merits of including a cyber-diligence obligation as part of the State responsibility framework.\n10.

Introduction\nCyberspace has “developed from [networks] of academic researchers into a mainstream communications mechanism.” Unfortunately, enhanced information flow results in the medium’s misuse. States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction.\nMany States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure. Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements. “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence” all work against custom crystallizing. Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity\n16.

Obliging each State to take all available measures to stop cyberattacks which emanate from their territories would improve the security of interconnected networks globally.\nArguably, to date, no cyberattack has risen to the level of a use of force. Aggrieved States have not invoked State responsibility for a failure to prevent injurious cyberattacks. Yet, live trackers record over six million cyberattacks daily, and fear of cyber insecurity has gripped the world. States increasingly invest in cyber capabilities to protect against escalations in cyberattack severity, with cyberspace militarisation widely forecasted. Some commentators opine that cyber weapons are the next “weapon of choice” for terrorism. This kind of event could propel a global uptake and strict application of cyber-diligence.

It aims to comprehensively define the contents and triggers of a cyber-diligence obligation, and offer reasoned conclusions which States could implement in practice. The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void.\nThe present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to \"peacetime\" cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack. These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers. Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State.\nFirst, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty. Cyber-diligence should be classified as an obligation of conduct. As the International Court of Justice (\"I.C.J.\") states: \"the obligation of States [is] to [employ] all means reasonably available to them\" to prevent injurious activity. But a State does not\n27. Thomas M. Franck, What Happens Now? The United Nations after Iraq, 97 AM. J. INT.

However, States should implement the polluter pays principle. Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts.\nThird, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network.\nFourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation. An objective standard of due diligence, defined through best-practice exchanges, could provide a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of States’ compliance.

States also have different capabilities to intervene in cyberspace. As a result, their capacity should limit their responsibility.\nCyberattacks transcend exclusive territorial control. But the threat does not necessitate a reinvention of international law. The proposed cyber-diligence framework preserves State-centric responsibility in cyberspace, extending post-Westphalian sovereignty to a relatively Hobbesian environment (which is barely 20 years old). The author is hopeful that the present paper can contribute to international law as a project of imposing and maintaining “order through words, whether at sea or on land . . . or indeed in cyberspace.”\n34.

THE PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF DUE DILIGENCE IN STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## A. Due Diligence derives from Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nDue diligence is a corollary of States’ equal sovereignty. States enjoy plenary jurisdiction to control objects and subjects within their territory, but must also “respect . . . the territorial sovereignty and political integrity” of others. Flowing from States’ reciprocal respect, the I.C.J. famously articulated the due diligence obligation: “it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” Due diligence, accordingly, has developed into a general principle of international law.\n40.

States should exercise cyber-diligence over cyber activity within their “legal or regulatory control.” It is the concept of territorial sovereignty which underpins all due diligence obligations. But what is “territory” in cyberspace, when the realm has no physical boundaries?\nReferences to cyberspace in this paper adopt a dualistic character: the virtual domain which facilitates internet communications and the physical hardware sustaining the domain’s operation. Cyberspace, as an intangible medium, can only exist inside tangible infrastructure. It operates via “networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures” located within a State’s territory.\nWithin their territory, States enjoy exclusive legal authority over: (1) cyber-infrastructure; (2) cyber-activity associated with their cyberinfrastructure, and; (3) persons engaged in cyber activity. States should also bear a primary due diligence obligation to ensure that their infrastructure is not used to harm the equal sovereignty of other States. A State’s failure to exercise due diligence should constitute an internationally wrongful act.\n46. Memorandum from the U.S. Dep’t. of Defense, supra note 12.\n47.

But States ought to be informed of what positive actions fulfil the obligation (Section III) and when these actions should be undertaken (Section IV). First, this paper explores a characteristic of due diligence obligations: strong in adaptability but weak in enforcement.\n# III. CONTENTS OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\n## A. Obligation of Conduct versus Obligation of Result58\nDue diligence is a \"relative, not absolute,\"59 obligation of conduct. States have the discretion to adopt any feasible measures to prevent cyberattacks injuring other States,60 \"without warranting that the [attacks] will not occur.\"61 Breach of the obligation turns on whether a territorial State took all appropriate measures to protect the victim\nTY: THE GENERAL PART 227 (2013).\n56.

Whether the territorial State had “genuine capacity to avert the threat” in the circumstances informs the assessment.\nDue diligence obligations differ from obligations of result, which require that a State must prevent the occurrence of a cyberattack, regardless of the means employed. These obligations represent a State’s absolute guarantee to reach a precise outcome. Imposing an obligation of result in cyber-diligence would likely require States to adopt burdensome practices. Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.\n## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty\nObligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States. The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States. In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence . . . into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”\n.

INT’L L. 371, 375 (1999).\n\nHowever, an obligation of conduct's elasticity has deficiencies. First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks. Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation. Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.” As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises. The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”\nCyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”, establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained . . . the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”\nThis paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature. But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework.\n.

Cyber-Diligence should not adopt the Preventive Principle\nWe begin our examination with the preventive principle, a significant element within established due diligence models. The principle requires States to take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of transboundary damage where the risk is known.78 Preventive cyber-diligence would oblige States to create and maintain a clean infrastructural environment, in advance of any cyberattacks.79 We will not address the precautionary principle, which applies in the absence of scientific certainty that a risk will cause harm.80 It is settled that cyberattacks could cause serious injury.81\nSome commentators82—and a U.N. Working Group83—posit that States should undertake preventive cyber-diligence.84 The suggestions include:85\n78.

Monitoring suspicious activity.\nA number of these procedural steps constitute custom in international environmental law.[87] While these measures could obviate transboundary harm, they would do little to suppress ongoing or imminent cyberattacks. For instance, risk assessment identifies vulnerable networks. States could secure these networks, improve long-term network health, and make future cyberattacks harder to execute.[88] But risk assessment would do little to reduce injuries from a cyberattack that is underway. Hacktivists can launch attacks from infrastructure in States with lower cybersecurity,[89] diverting the source but not the effect of the eventual injury.[90] Another preventive measure could be to destroy malicious software (\"malware\") capable of being \"weaponized\" in a cyberattack. But nearly 200,000 new malware codes are identified daily.[91] The negligible effects of \"search and destroy\" operations do not warrant State expenditure.[92]\nPreventive measures are of minimal use when cyberattacks penetrate computer networks and cause instant injury. The territorial State should assist instead in the \"rescue effort\". They should engage skilled experts\nINCIDENTS: LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 60-61 (2010).\n86. See infra, III.B.3.\n87.

We shall demonstrate that a State's preventive duties should be confined to the circumstances in which it arose, transboundary environmental harm.\n## C. International Environmental Law\nThis subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence.\nScholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of \"noxious activity\" and prevention of \"information pollution.\" The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the \"no harm\" principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas). States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State. In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed: \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory . . . to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another . . .\n.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of \"natural resources ... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the \"neighbouring State\" concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103\nWe dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State. A cyberattack can be directed from any distant location connected to the internet and traverse\n98. Trail Smelter (U.S. v. Can.), 3 R.I.A.A. 1905, 1950 (Mixed Claims Comm'n 1938, 1941).\n99.

Id.\n\nnumerous States before it harms a network.\nSecond, the I.C.J.'s jurisprudential promotion of the preventive principle aims to secure the environment's long term sustainability and avoid disturbance to its ecological balance. Environmental damage cannot easily be undone. The harm's irreversibility underpins societies' willingness to adopt aggressive steps to control the perceived risk. This rationale is not transferable to cyberspace. Cyberspace, still in its infancy, has seemingly infinite resources. Permanent cyberspace degradation is not an issue: servers can be restored after attacks and security breaches can be repaired. At worst, physical infrastructure and data destroyed in a cyberattack still would not affect the overall functioning of the cyberspace domain.\nStates have no impetus to restrict private actors from \"polluting\" cyberspace. The \"tragedy of the commons\" theory reasons that \"we are locked into a system of fouling our own nest\". This is because the cost of the waste \"[a person] discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying [her] wastes.\" We do not foul the cyberspace \"nest\" because no amount of \"cyberwaste\" can (currently) overload and inhibit cyberspace functions. The medium fosters independent gain without fear of endangering the cyberspace platform.\nThe \"polluter pays\" principle should be applied to shift the duty of prevention onto private industry. (This should sit alongside States criminalising cyber-offences for individual liability.) As Alan Boyle suggests, \"it may be simpler, quicker, and economically more efficient to make polluters . . . pay rather than States.\" State regulations should\n.

International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 9 I.L.M.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nIn cyberspace, the polluter's \"payment\" should expand beyond monetary compensation (damages or taxes) to individual civil and criminal liability. The \"cyber-polluter\" should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable.\nSecond, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to \"threat intelligence\" companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence, \"cyber-pollution\" should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126]\nDirecting a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for \"cyber-pollution\" incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability. Consumer perception of network owners' cyber vulnerability could result in reputational and stock-price hits. The\n45, entered into force May 30, 1996.\n121.

State regulation should reinforce economic deterrence: “unclean” network owners should not receive government tenders and private contracts.\nBut emphasising private law reparations would have downsides. First, a private liability regime could dilute State responsibility, moving questions of cyber-diligence from public international law into private international law. The principle risks “exonerating certain subjects of international law from their share of responsibility for damage” caused by cyberattacks.\nSecond, civil liability does “not always [guarantee] real compensation for the damage caused to the environment.” A compensation scheme does not rectify the damage already caused to networks. To counter this inadequacy, States ought to take positive steps to terminate cyberattacks that are in progress and mitigate injury as far as possible. They should also bear cooperation duties to help restore injured networks post-cyberattack.\nIn limited State practice, victim States readily initiate prosecution under domestic criminal laws after they ascertain a hacker’s identity. In 2007, cyberattacks targeted Estonia’s government websites, e-services, and information infrastructure after Estonia removed a Soviet-era memorial. Attack methods included denial of service (“DOS”),\n. Tyler Moore, *Introducing the Economics of Cybersecurity: Principles and Policy Options, in NAT'L RES.

After the onslaught, Estonia sought to subject alleged hackers to computer sabotage crimes in their Penal Code. The U.S. has also prosecuted five Chinese hackers under their criminal code, despite the hackers being identified as members of the Chinese military, and by extension, carrying out official State organ functions.\nBut successful investigation and prosecution requires “dual criminality” of the cyberattack offence in both the victim State and the perpetrator’s domicile State. If the domicile State has not criminalized cyberattacks, they are unlikely to extradite their national for prosecution. Gathering sufficient evidence to prosecute would also be difficult: the victim State needs to access information held by the domicile State. For example, Russia refused to assist Estonia to identify hackers with Russian IP addresses. This occurred despite their bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.\nThis subsection demonstrates that the preventive principle should not be adopted in States’ cyber-diligence. Rather, despite its shortcomings, States should use the polluter pays principle to pressure industry to improve cybersecurity. States should implement the principle into domestic law as part of their cyber-diligence obligation.\nHaving established that the due diligence obligation in\n135.

As is taken up later, cyberspace, unlike the high seas, is not a res communis. An analogy with the marine environment also impractically extends the scope of cyber-diligence obligations to nationals outside territorial control. But it provides guidance for an adequate regulatory framework in cyber-diligence.\n## D. International Law of the Sea\nPart XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"UNCLOS\") enshrines States' due diligence obligations within the marine environment. Article 192 establishes the general obligation to \"protect and preserve the marine environment.\" Under Article 193, States enjoy the sovereign right to exploit natural resources, but must also take measures to prevent pollution to the marine environment.\nSeveral differences arise when applying due diligence obligations in the marine environment compared to cyberspace. First, due diligence obligations under UNCLOS do not exclusively attach to sovereignty. Vessels may operate in areas where States enjoy mutual rights. Articles 192 and 193 oblige flag States to ensure conservation of living resources, including in the exclusive economic zones of other States. To discharge this obligation, flag States ought to ensure vessels within their jurisdiction and control \"do not undermine [their] obligations . . . to protect and preserve the marine environment.\" The arbitral\n.

China knowingly tolerated “the propeller chopping method” exploiting living reefs across the Spratlys within their jurisdiction and control. China knew that their flagged vessels poached endangered species outside of their territorial control, which “[inflicted] significant damage on rare or fragile ecosystems.”\nAttaching due diligence obligations to the conduct of nationals would simply not work in the same way in cyberspace. A State’s cyber-diligence obligation should not extend to terminating a cyberattack initiated by a national abroad. In the sea, a flag vessel’s physical location is identifiable. A State’s due diligence obligation follows their flag vessels’ chartered territory. In cyberspace, a State exercises authority over infrastructure within their exclusive control both in their territory and extraterritorially. But a State’s jurisdictional control of their nationals assumes different characteristics. The operations of transnational non-State actors (and their data trails) are often borderless, simultaneously residing in multiple jurisdictions.\n.

Id. rule 2 cmt para. 3.\n\nConsider the diagram: a national of State A, physically located in State B, usurps networks in States C and D to launch attacks. For State A to terminate the cyberattacks, it needs to access networks in States C and D (constituting prohibited interference, $^{155}$  unless States C and D grant consent). In this situation, besides a duty of cooperation to assist a victim State's investigations of their national, State A should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation to terminate the cyberattack.\nSeparately, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea's (\"ITLOS\") Seabed Disputes Advisory Opinion articulates internal laws and regulations which States ought to adopt to fulfil due diligence obligations.[156] UNCLOS places due diligence obligations on States who engage contractors for projects within international waters (sponsoring States).[157] Sponsoring States are required to \"[adopt] laws\n155.

See infra, III.C.\n\n|  Extracted Principles | Cyber-Diligence Application  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (1) To fulfil due diligence obligations, sponsoring States must enact laws, regulations, and administrative measures enforcing the obligations of contractors.1 Contractual arrangements are insufficient.2 | Territorial States should: (1) criminalise cyberattacks causing serious injury in foreign territory and; (2) incentivise network owners to secure infrastructure.  |\n|  (2) “[The obligations] may include [establishing] enforcement mechanisms for active supervision of the activities of the sponsored contractor.”3 | States should:○ In grants and tenders, prioritise corporations with clean “track records” or those diligently securing their networks. These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases.  |\n|  (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity.  |\nLiu\nThese measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State, and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity.\nCyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured.\nInternational cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked.\n## E. An Assessment of International Cooperation in Cyberspace\nCurrently, two trends in cybersecurity cooperation can be observed:\n1. States engage in multilateral cooperation efforts within regional or political alliances.\n2. States implement cybersecurity cooperation between the public and private sectors, who share intelligence and coordinate\n. Seabed Mining, supra note 70, para. 218.\n.

As most networks are privately owned or managed, States coordinate use of the acquired expertise in situation (2).\nCybersecurity cooperation boosts cybersecurity in the long term, but does not enforce cooperative duties during and after particular cyberattacks. Political expediency presents an obstacle to cyberattack cooperation. For example, a bilateral agreement between Russia and Estonia enshrined “obligations” to transfer evidence, assist in investigations, and extradite alleged perpetrators of criminal offences. In spite of this, Russia refused to assist Estonia’s investigations after the 2007 cyberattacks. Russia’s interpretation of the treaty excluded surveillance measures identifying a perpetrator’s physical location. A restrictive interpretation conceals, perhaps, a lack of cooperative will. Some States possibly favour a poorly regulated cyberspace. States can leverage assistance to gain traction with allies, or refuse\nTY PLANNING (2016), http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Security-Planning/; EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY, EUROPEAN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENCE (EP3R) (2009) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies; German Federal Office for Information Security, IT-Grundschutz (2016), https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/; Shackleford, supra note 20, at 29.\n.

Conversely, States may not seek or provide assistance for fear of exposing their cyber vulnerabilities or cyber-technology.[173]\nCooperative duties nonetheless need to be \"clear, useful, and doable.\"[174] To complement current regimes, they ought to immediately contain a cyberattack. States should commission cybersecurity experts,[175] and:\n1. deploy their experts to secure critical (and vulnerable) networks domestically, reducing the risk of cyberattacks emanating from their territory; and\n2. in the event of an ongoing cyberattack, mobilize these experts in real-time to instantly upgrade network security.\nExperts could be exchanged between contracting agencies within cooperating States.[176] Each State could mobilize experts from multiple jurisdictions if cyberattacks occurred or if their private sector demanded increased protection. States with cyber-monitoring capabilities may warn others, in advance, of increased malicious traffic indicating imminent cyberattack(s).[177] A target State can then boost network capacity in anticipation. In ongoing cyberattacks, assisting States may host servers, transfer bandwidth, and eliminate botnet traffic.\nBut these suggestions remain aspirational. First, duties to co-operate are obligations of conduct \"formulated in a relatively weak way,\"[178] which do not drive outcomes. In Southern Bluefin Tuna, a treaty obligation required parties to \"consult, [and] resolve the dispute by negotiation or other peaceful means of their own choice.\"[179] The parties were only\n173.

A unilateral referral of the dispute to judicial settlement or arbitration was ineffective. Indeed, as the Estonia-Russia Treaty illustrates, States exercise discretion in their adherence to a cooperation treaty.\nSecond, some commentators stress that States bear a legal obligation to cooperate in reducing cyber threats, as cyberspace integrity is relevant to international security. Katharina Ziolkowski argues: “the internet presents another global resource [which is] in the common interest of the international community.” We ought to exercise caution before suggesting cooperative duties that have arisen within the natural environment or the seabed apply to cyberspace.\nUnlike the high seas, or outer space, cyberspace is not a “common concern of humankind” (res communis).

Cyberspace is not a natural, indivisible asset. Each State is encouraged to invest in cyberspace to reap economic, political, and social benefits.\nStates currently have no incentive to agree on a common regulatory regime in cyberspace. Doing so would decrease their margin of appreciation to set cyberspace priorities. Any common interests in cyberspace fasten on ensuring the platform's development, so that each State can advance their private interest. States increasingly “[establish sovereign control] in the virtual world in the name of security and economic sustainability.”\nThird, cooperative efforts will likely be limited to agreements between politically aligned States. The European Union has initiated best-practice and cyber-intelligence exchanges. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology collaborates with “the U.K., Japan, Korea, Estonia, Israel and Germany” to spread best practice in domestic cybersecurity.\nPerhaps this paper’s assessment of international cooperation appears overly negative. Initially, the above passages may indicate international law is epiphenomenal, allowing powerful States to grant their cooperation at will.

Prevention of Transnational Terrorism\n## 1. Introduction\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks share parallels. The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed. We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\" A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats. These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law. They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory. Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear . . . to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.” A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.\n## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison\nInternational law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network” without a formal hierarchy. Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”. Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.\nAnonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.” The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream,\n208. *Id.* at 114.\n209.

Its \"ops\" begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to \"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling \"anons\" into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites. In 2012, \"anons\" initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline. \"Operation Anti-ACTA\" responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.

They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.\n215. D.C.

Coleman, supra note 217.\n\n# 3. Incorporating the Counter-Terrorism Model of Due Diligence\nStates bear an obligation to prevent the terrorist conduct of non-State actors. The obligation existed within custom and conventions well before 9/11. However, this paper focuses on the counter-terrorism standard of due diligence established within Resolution 1373.\nIn handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.” States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.” The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.\nResolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations. States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation). These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security, which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.\n.

SAUL, supra note 202, at 21; Bardo Fassbender, The U.N. Security Council and\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nResolution 1373 established the Counter-Terrorism Committee (\"C.T.C.\") and required \"all States to report to the Committee . . . on the steps they have taken to implement this resolution.\"\nThe C.T.C. initiated a transnational \"capacity building blitz\". The S.C. should similarly establish a Cyber-Diligence Committee (\"C.D.C.\"). First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks.\n## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision\nResolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures. The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies, and does not enforce sanctions on those who \"fail\" to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment.\nThe U.N. General Assembly has established the Group of Governmental Experts in Information Security (\"G.G.E.\"), signalling an intention to centralise cybersecurity efforts.

The C.D.C's overall goal should be to assist (particularly developing) States building capacity to prevent cyberattacks. A gradual improvement in capacity throughout all 191 U.N. member States could decrease the frequency of cyberattacks, although this will take time, and requires ample financial resources.\nThe C.D.C's specific functions should resemble those of the C.T.C.: appoint experts to advise States on cyber-diligence compliance, coordinate assistance between donors and donees, and elicit compulsory written reports on States' capacity building measures. A C.D.C. reduces the discretion of States to determine appropriate measures for cyber-diligence. Through reviews, the C.D.C. should implicitly set a due diligence standard for States to meet in acquiring capacity. A C.D.C. should stress the relative nature of cyber-diligence and not stretch the obligation into one of absolute prevention. (It should centralize responsibility for co-ordinating cyber-diligence efforts, but preserve due diligence as an obligation of conduct.)\n233.

PROULX, supra note 212, at 79; BECKER, supra note 202, at 145.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nHowever, a capacity-building focus has limitations. It risks creating a disparity between States' reported capacity and their actual exercise of that capacity. Unresolved tensions include:\n1. whether the C.D.C. should impose effective enforcement mechanisms, or respect State decisions on internal social, economic, and political matters; and\n2. how the C.D.C. should determine which States: (i) do not have a genuine capacity to acquire or execute cyber-diligence (unable but willing), and; which States (ii) have the capacity (in reality) to exercise cyber-diligence, but decline to do so (able but unwilling).\nIn the counter-terrorism context, Tal Becker proposes that due diligence standards should apply to a State:\n1. acquiring the (legal, administrative, and resource) capacity to meet their due diligence obligations, and;\n2. “[employing] its capabilities with due diligence”.\nBecker’s proposed standards should be incorporated into States’ cyber-diligence obligations. The C.D.C. should supervise States’ compliance with limb (1). States who fail to notify the C.D.C. of their capacity deficits should be disentitled from pleading a lack of capacity if a subsequent cyberattack implicates their networks. This approach limits the responsibility of unable but willing States for a particular cyberattack, provided they have fulfilled limb (1) to the extent of their capacity. Other domestic exigencies may militate against\n. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128.\n. U.N. Charter art. 2(7).\n. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128; BARNIDGE JR., supra note 212, at 140-41; see also TRAPP, supra note 63, at 70-80.\n. BECKER, supra note 202, at 144-145; PROULX, supra note 212, at 17.\n. BECKER, supra note 209, at 146.\n\nLiu\na State's exercise of cyber-diligence capabilities. If so, a State should not be held in violation of limb (2), taking into account the particular circumstances at the time of the cyberattack.\nIf *able but unwilling* States simply ignore limb (2), establishing a failure to exercise cyber-diligence would be relatively straightforward. However, difficulties arise where *able but unwilling* States exercise cyber-diligence “half-heartedly”. For instance, a State could neutralise a third of the total botnets emanating from their territory (when they have the capacity to terminate the entire cyberattack). To establish violation, the victim State ought to prove that the territorial State did not employ their full capacity to prevent the cyberattack.\nThere is no “quick fix” to these tensions. Nonetheless, a C.D.C. should introduce an internationally calibrated strategy to capacity building in cyber-diligence. Far from being merely theoretical, 159 States have received counter-terrorism assistance as a result of the C.T.C. A C.D.C. realises the UN’s role of equipping States with the *capacity for* cyber-diligence, but not overstepping its intergovernmental character to intervene in States’ actual exercise of cyber-diligence.\nThis section argues that the contents of a State’s cyber-diligence obligation should include: (1) the “cyber-polluter pays” principle; (2) implementing regulations for industry to secure infrastructure, and; (3) capacity-building via consultation with the C.D.C. But States ought to know what circumstances enliven their obligation to fulfil these contents. The following section considers the two key triggers of cyber-diligence obligations: knowledge and injury.\n244. TRAPP, *supra* note 63, at 79.\n245.

Does Actual or Constructive Knowledge Trigger Cyber-Diligence?\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, a sovereign's responsibility for their subjects' actions consists of \"forbearance\" and \"protection shewn to transgressions.\" The sovereign must: (1) know of the transgression and; (2) fail to prevent or punish the delinquency.\nKnowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility. States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it. Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury. There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion. A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.\nThis paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:\n250.

A botnet is \"a network of compromised computers.\" \"The bots\" are remotely controlled by the \"botherder\" and conduct coordinated cyber operations. There is no limit on the number of bots that can be \"recruited\". See Schmitt ed., supra note 25, at 257; COMMITTEE ON OFFENSIVE INFORMATION WARFARE, supra note 25, at 89.\n254. But see, infra IV.3.b.\n255. Unless the state itself launched the cyberattack, a fact that is exceedingly difficult to prove.\n\n1. Actual knowledge: a State knows of a cyberattack (where a State organ conducts the cyberattack);\n2. Conniance: a State wilfully shuts their eyes to the obvious occurrence of a cyberattack (for example, after detecting the cyberattack or being notified of it);\n3. Objective evidence leads to a logical conclusion that:\n- a State ought to have known of a cyberattack, or;\n- a State had information on a cyberattack, and was obliged to undertake further inquiries, but failed to do so;\n4. In the event a C.D.C. is adopted, States bear a heightened duty of vigilance to identify and eliminate threats within their territory. Constructive knowledge and an obligation to undertake further inquiries are built into this duty.\nCategories (1) – (2) constitute subjective knowledge, while categories (3) – (4) amount to constructive (objective) knowledge. First, we demonstrate that all four categories should suffice to trigger cyber-diligence. Second, we suggest an appropriate standard of proof to establish a territorial State’s knowledge before an international court or tribunal (“international tribunal”).\n## 1. Subjective Knowledge is Difficult to Establish\n### i. Categories 1 and 2\nSubjective knowledge is the highest degree of intent. A State either intended the cyberattack to cause serious injury, or endorsed the outcome. In judicial proceedings, victim States may struggle to establish a territorial State’s actual knowledge or connivance. The accused State’s sovereignty shrouds any evidence of subjective knowledge in secrecy. It is unthinkable that an accused State would surrender documents\n.

Alb.), 1949 I.C.J.

In Tehran Hostages, the I.C.J. relied on notification to infer Iran's actual knowledge of militant raids. Iran was \"fully aware . . . of the urgent need for action,\" given \"repeated calls for help\" to the Iranian Foreign Ministry. Iran's inaction was \"due to more than mere negligence or lack of appropriate means.\"\nHowever, victim States rarely notify territorial States of a cyberattack. Notification consumes time, does little to reduce injury, and tarnishes inter-State relations. Instead, a State will likely devote their resources to withstanding a cyberattack. In the Estonian incident, botnet infiltrations implicated computers in 178 countries. Estonia did not notify one territorial State. Instead, Estonia increased bandwidth capacity (so networks could handle increased traffic), filtered malicious transmissions, and engaged U.S. and N.A.T.O. assistance to terminate sources of the attack. Some territorial States voluntarily neutralized sources of attacks.\nIn 2008, Georgia and Russia engaged in armed conflict over the South Ossetia region. Georgia suffered concurrent cyberattacks on their governmental, commercial and media networks, (supposedly) coordinated via Russian infrastructure. Georgia, a \"cyber-locked\" State, relied on neighbouring States' cyber infrastructure to facilitate\n258. Tribunals have questioned the veracity of leaked documents. Prosecutor v.

Georgia did not notify Russia of the cyberattacks, instead relocating important servers to the U.S. Google's secure servers temporarily hosted a news portal, and NATO also secured Georgian networks.\nIf only notification could enliven knowledge, then no cyber-diligence could ever be triggered in incidents like the cyberattacks on Estonia and Georgia. Victim States mitigate loss and boost defences when a cyberattack begins. Politically allied States disable attack sources and offer relief networks. Victim States do not benefit from notification.\nThe knowledge threshold to trigger cyber-diligence should be lowered. Kimberley Trapp argues (in the counter-terrorism context): \"requiring proof of subjective knowledge would effectively act as a bar to any finding of responsibility for a failure to prevent.\" A territorial State's cyber-diligence obligation should be triggered if they \"ought to have known\" of a cyberattack.\n## 2. Constructive Knowledge Should Trigger Cyber-Diligence Obligations\n### i. Category 3\nInternational jurisprudence supports constructive knowledge triggering due diligence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J's majority judgment relied on a series of inferences to conclude that the minefield laying \"could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of Albania.\" The majority inferred Albania's knowledge according to objective standards.\n.

Corfu Channel, supra note 44, at 19-20.\nLiu\nThe U.K. was not required to prove Albania knew (subjectively) of the mines' presence. Notably, two dissentients (Judge Azevedo and Judge Krylov) held Albania was under a continuous duty to inform itself of reasonably foreseeable threats in its territory, or, as Ian Brownlie argues, “[to] take reasonable care to discover activities of trespassers.”\nIn the Bosnian Genocide case, the I.C.J. found that a State’s obligation to prevent the occurrence of genocide is engaged “at the instant that the State learns of, or should normally have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.” Engaging the obligation to prevent genocide is tantamount to triggering cyber-diligence if the State should have reasonably known of the attack’s occurrence.\nIn Asian Agricultural Products, the Tribunal emphasized Sri Lanka bore a duty to exercise “[an] ‘objective’ standard of vigilance in assessing the required degree of protection and security . . . for foreign investors.” The language of these cases suggest that constructive knowledge should be established if the territorial State had information that a cyberattack might occur and failed to conduct further inquiries.\nElsewhere, some commentators argue constructive knowledge should be presumed when a cyberattack implicates a State’s exclusive governmental infrastructure. The aggrieved State ought to establish that the attack travelled through the territorial State’s governmental infrastructure. Constructive knowledge is prima facie established if the infrastructure was under direct State control and used only for\n275. Id.; TRAPP, supra note 63, at 69; BECKER, supra note 202, at 134.\n276.

Many states lack the technical expertise to collect and analyse such evidence, so outsourcing is likely required.\n\npublic purposes.283\nThis approach should be tempered. Indications of government infrastructure's involvement in a cyberattack can be deceiving. First, non-State hackers may compromise a government server.284 A cyberattack being mounted from government infrastructure does not in itself establish responsibility in the cyber context.285\nSecond, cyberattacks are often dressed with \"spoofing\" (identify manipulation) techniques. In the Estonian incident, spoofing clouded evidence which incriminated Moscow's exclusive infrastructure: unknown perpetrators could have adopted the veil of a Moscow government computer.286 Often, \"onion routing\" techniques are used to conceal perpetrators' identity.287 The majority of cyberattacks use such masquerading tactics.288 Even if network logs suggest a cyberattack exploited government infrastructure, the victim State should still be bound to adduce evidence to dismiss spoofing concerns.\nSome commentators stretch the presumption of constructive knowledge further. They advocate a reverse presumptio juris whenever a cyberattack is associated with government infrastructure,289 or when \"injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State.\"290 International tribunals would shift the burden of proof onto the territorial State, who must disprove their presumed constructive knowledge.291\n283.

Ryan et al., supra note 289.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nReversal of the burden of proof conflicts with I.C.J. jurisprudence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J. did not infer Albania's constructive knowledge of injurious activity purely based on their exclusive territorial control. Territorial control does not “[shift] the burden of proof . . . in relation to unlawful acts perpetrated therein.” In Pulp Mills, the I.C.J. stated “a preventive approach . . . does not [operate] as a reversal of the burden of proof.” It is not for the territorial State to prove its diligence. State control over governmental networks only gives rise to “abstract and immaterial knowledge” of a cyberattack, insufficient to presume State responsibility.\nBut victim States may use the accused State's control over government infrastructure as evidence. Section IV.A.3. explains how a pattern of such evidence should establish constructive knowledge. But first, we examine how constructive knowledge would operate under category 4.\n## ii. Category 4\nWith reference to Section III.F.3., should a C.D.C. framework be established, a degree of constructive knowledge should be presumed. Territorial States would be held to a standard of vigilance in maintaining their cyber-territory, and constructive knowledge of an ongoing or imminent attack would be imputed to these States. States would have less latitude to plead a lack of capacity to discover a particular cyberattack.\nPresuming knowledge would reflect heightened expectations for State compliance with cyber-diligence obligations. The victim State still bears the burden of proof and should establish knowledge\n292.

Overcoming the Evidentiary Hurdle: Standard of Proof\nTypically, a failure in due diligence will be raised after the victim State (“applicant”) suffers injury. The issue turns to causation. How does the applicant gather sufficient evidence to establish that actual or constructive knowledge triggered the territorial State’s (“respondent”) cyber-diligence obligation? The applicant will struggle to establish their case absent the respondent’s assistance or at least consent to evidence collection.\nThe I.C.J. acknowledges that victim States face evidentiary difficulties, allowing a “more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence . . . provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.” But the standard of proof in an international tribunal should not be lowered “simply because it is . . . difficult to reach.” The standard “[protects] the respondent against false attribution . . . a particularly serious risk in the cyber context.”\nThe applicant must produce reliable and neutral evidence to establish that the respondent at least ought to have known of the cyberattack. They could rely on experts to adduce logs of the respondent’s network behaviour during the cyberattack.

The applicant may also produce documentary data and press reports to establish the respondent had sufficient information to make further inquiries into the cyberattack, but failed to do so.\nSome commentators advocate for a “very liberal approach to evidence [in cyberspace].” They contrast the anonymity of cyberattacks against kinetic threats, which are physically traceable, before, during, and after the attack.\nHowever, the primary rule invoked in a matter determines the standard of proof. International tribunals should not adopt a low standard of proof in due diligence matters. As Durward Sandifer argues: “in dealing with sovereign States . . . it cannot lightly be presumed that one of the parties to the litigation is guilty of negligence.” Doing so may result in evidence of low probative value establishing a breach of due diligence, which would undercut the presumption that States observe international law. Conversely, the standard of proof should not be so “unduly exacting” that it becomes impossible to meet.\nRep. 2014 (Mar. 31), p. 226, 237 paras 18-20, 255-57 paras 73-82, 283 paras 188-90, 290-93 paras 217-227; The South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of Philippines v.

It also incentivizes States to secure (at least) their governmental infrastructure. But the approach does not prejudice States who lack the capacity to safeguard their governmental infrastructure.\nQuestions of a State's actual or constructive knowledge are contingent on a judicial forum's evidentiary standards. Together, they form the \"knowledge\" element to trigger cyber-diligence obligations. A threshold of constructive knowledge proven to a clear and convincing standard has been advanced. This paper now turns to the second trigger-element: injury.\n## B. What Level of Injury Engages A Cyber-Diligence Duty?\nInjury is not a pre-requisite to finding an internationally wrongful act under the laws of State responsibility. Once a breach is attributed to a State, responsibility is potentially engaged, subject to application of the primary rule. In the context of due diligence, however, damage is a condition to finding a violation of the primary rule. A State who failed to exercise cyber-diligence is only liable for breaching the primary rule after hostile acts, contrary to another State's legal rights, occur. When \"due diligence is violated, there is an attribution to the State . . . of the consequences of the acts of [private] persons.\"\n. See infra, V.\n.

States must exercise cyber-diligence to disable cyberattacks which detrimentally affect the legal rights of other States. Responsibility attaches when a cyberattack infracts the \"theoretical inviolability\" of a national legal order. Cyber-diligence obligations \"re-establish the status quo erat.\" With that in mind, this section defines \"serious injury\" to trigger States' cyber-diligence obligations.\nThe Tallinn Manual defines an \"unlawful [cyber] act\" as \"all cyber activities from one State's territory that affect the rights of other States [producing] a negative effect.\" The definition covers any operation affecting \"sovereignty\": a lower level of injury compared to an act of interference or armed force.\nHowever, when is \"a negative effect\" of sufficient gravity to trigger cyber-diligence? Jurisprudence and the literature establish a context-dependent standard of serious injury. In *Trail Smelter*, the arbitral tribunal stated \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury . . . when the case is of serious consequence.\" Some commentators state that \"serious injury\" triggers the duty, without further explanation. The Tallinn Manual ambiguously concludes that \"physical damage to objects or injuries to\n. See infra, III.B.\n.

The concept does not define what measures a State should take during the occurrence of the injury. In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.\nThis paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories. We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation. The types of injury listed are non-exhaustive, but represent differing levels of severity.\n## 1. Injury to Persons or Loss of Life; Physical Damage or Destruction of Objects\nCyberattacks which cause physical damage equivalent to conventional attacks could constitute armed force or armed attack (when launched by a State). While discussions of *jus ad bellum* are beyond this paper’s scope, several observations should be made.\nFirst, category 1 represents cyberattack injury of the highest severity. Any physical harm to persons or objects would trigger a territorial State’s cyber-diligence obligation. But it is very rare for a cyberattack to cause category 1 damage.

Some argue that attacks on critical national infrastructure (such as water supply and electricity grids) would likely lead to secondary consequences of physical injury to persons and objects. An attack on one critical network has a “synergistic effect,” propagating injury to other connected physical infrastructures.\nSuch conclusions need to be balanced. The scale and duration of a cyberattack and the effectiveness of the target State’s response determines the likelihood of category 1 injuries. In 2015, for the first time, a cyberattack struck an electricity grid, in Ukraine. The attackers hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) systems in seven substations, disconnecting power to 225,000 Ukrainians for three hours. Some had anticipated an “electronic Pearl Harbour” once a cyberattack hits an electric grid. This did not occur. The Ukrainian energy providers shifted to manual operations and restored electricity quickly. No physical damage to infrastructure occurred.\nSecond, as yet, only State organs are equipped and motivated to inflict material injury using cyber-offensive capabilities. Such a cyberattack would automatically be considered an act of the State. Liability turns on attribution and the breach of an international\n340.

A State may forego invoking intermediary cyber-diligence breaches if the injury is serious, preferring to treat it instead as armed force or armed attack so as to enliven jus ad bellum. Non-State hacktivists rarely (if ever) cause physical injury. Hackers instead inundate networks with DDOS attacks or implant malware and extract information.[347]\nThird, no reported cyberattack has yet caused injury to persons or loss of life.[348] Some have come close: hackers infiltrated a hospital network and lethally altered a patient's dosages, only to be discovered by a nurse before the drug was administered.[349] Debate exists about whether the 2010 Stuxnet virus actually caused physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.[350] Stuxnet took control of SCADA networks, manipulated data and controlled the processing speed of centrifuges. One commentator argues that the injury suffered was a mere usurpation of the SCADA networks and not injury to the physical integrity of the centrifuges.[351] Apart from Stuxnet, to date, we have been unable to identify a single cyberattack which has caused physical damage to a network's physical components and not merely destroying data or incapacitating network functions.[352]\nCyberattacks overloaded and temporarily suspended networks in the Estonian and Georgian incidents.[353] But, despite social and economic disruptions, no network reportedly suffered destructive or permanent\n347.

A rigid requirement of physical damage or destruction (perhaps more suited to conventional attacks) $^{354}$  is inappropriate for cyber-diligence. The cyber-diligence obligation prevents injury to cyber networks and infrastructure. A lower level of damage should also trigger cyber-diligence. One commentator notes: \"the dependency of modern societies on [computer] networks has made it possible to incapacitate physical infrastructures without destroying them.\" $^{355}$\n# 2. Loss of Network Functionality $^{356}$\nMost cyberattack methods disrupt target networks. Cyberattacks could overwhelm a network with botnet requests, cause system malfunction, or otherwise degrade the quality of network services.[357] Herbert Lin distinguishes between a (destructive) \"cyberattack\" and a (non-destructive) \"cyber-exploitation\".[358] The former renders a network unavailable, or undermines the network's integrity, without destroying any physical components.[359] For instance, DDOS attacks on Estonian infrastructure temporarily reduced accessibility to crucial services in the financial, telecommunications, media, and government sectors.[360] The attack significantly hindered the ability to conduct financial transactions, resulting in losses to industry and Estonian citizens.[361]\nThis paper argues that once a cyberattack causes serious disruptions to a network's proper functioning, the cyberattack is then \"destructive\",\n354.

Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries.\nSecondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack. The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm. Due diligence standards change according to “new scientific or technological knowledge [and] risks involved in the activity.” Primary injury to\n362.

If predictions of cyberattacks on health systems or transportation infrastructure materialise, the standard of cyber-diligence should rise to correspond to the increased risk. States should be obligated, with reference to the primary infrastructure affected, to take proportionate action to prevent or reduce secondary injuries (to the extent possible).\n## 3. Cyber-Exploitations\nThe third category of \"injury\" results from stealthily executed cyber activities, unknown the victim. \"Cyber-exploitation\" describes an activity intended to clandestinely access and exploit a network's vulnerabilities without disturbing the network's operation. Intelligence gathering operations most frequently cause this \"injury\". Hackers emplace malware into a network to collect information for economic or political purposes. Cyber-exploitations could also probe a network for vulnerabilities in preparation for future cyberattacks.\nThe term \"injury\" is hesitantly used to refer to category (3). It is unclear what injury cyber-exploitation actually causes to a victim State. \"[An] infringement of rights or legally protected interests\" activates cyber-diligence obligations. The question turns on whether peacetime cyber-exploitation infringes a target State's territorial sovereignty.\nArguably, covert cyber-exploitations which intrude on a network and extract data violate the \"honor, dignity or prestige of a State\"\n370.

Data collection programs including Ghostnet, PRISM and Tempora continue, implicitly tolerated by States, who \"will not want to deprive themselves of this tool.\" There is no clear answer as to whether cyber-exploitations constitute \"serious injury\" for cyber-diligence purposes. Invoking another State's failure to prevent cyber-exploitation will likely be perceived as hypocritical.\nThe Committee on Offensive Information Warfare notes that \"the distinction between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation may be very hard to draw from a technical standpoint and may lie primarily in the intent of the user.\" Indeed, a single cyberattack can cause category (2) and (3) effects.

The two infiltrations complement each other: the software assesses the network's vulnerabilities and determines a \"sweet spot\" to trigger the logic bomb, so as to cause the most injury. The (initially) non-destructive operation can mature, in real time, into a destructive cyberattack.\nSuccessful cyber-exploitation, which operates within a network, normally goes unnoticed. Cyber-diligence cannot be triggered without sufficient knowledge and should only be triggered when destructive effects materialise.\n## 4. Cyber-Vandalism, Irritation and Computer Crime\nThe Tallinn Manual regards \"mere irritation or inconvenience\" as not of sufficient seriousness to trigger cyber-diligence. Low-intensity cyber-vandalism does not cause serious disruption to a State and is appropriately classified as a domestic cybercrime under the Budapest Convention. 85% to 97% of all cybercrimes are not revealed let alone prosecuted. Such laxity in enforcement demonstrates States' passive tolerance of low-intensity cybercrimes. To counter \"close to unlimited\" instances of cyber-vandalism, States should improve domestic cybercrime regulation and dedicate cyber-diligence resources to preventing higher categories of injury.\nMarco Roscini argues that defacement alters computer data and should be characterized as a disruptive cyberattack (category 2\n385. Goodman, supra note 363; Kamal, supra note 343, at 40-41.

But it is difficult to see how defacement and propaganda goes beyond “visual corruption of public webpages”. Defacement may be considered offensive or even slanderous, depending on the target State’s political orientation. But unlike “destructive” cyberattacks, defacement merely causes superficial injuries to a network. Hacktivists intend to transmit unwanted political messages, not to overthrow a regime. *Oppenheim’s International Law* notes that due diligence obligations do not extend to “suppress[ing] criticism of, or propaganda directed against, other States or governments on the part of private persons.” Roscini himself recognizes that defacement is “relatively innocuous [and] psychological.” Cyber-diligence should not “imply an obligation to suppress all such conduct [inimical to] the regime or policy of a foreign State.”\nDespite the difficulties of retrospectively evaluating “serious injury”, this threshold reflects States’ concerns about cyberattacks which disable infrastructural operations. Under our formulation, cyber-exploitation and defacement fall below the threshold. States would likely avoid burdensome cyber-diligence for cyber activity of low-intensity, largely tolerated internationally.\nThe final section outlines hypothetical cyberattack scenarios and explores whether best-practice exchanges could set an implicit standard of cyber-diligence.\n392.

ASSESSING BREACH OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\nThe preceding sections define the contents and triggers of cyber-diligence obligations. This paper now discusses violation of the primary obligation.\nBreach of the primary obligation fastens on a State's knowledge, capacity to prevent, and the level of injury caused. Pierre-Marie Dupuy states: \"the true breach of an obligation of conduct is the breach of an obligation to behave (in a legally defined way).\" The accusing State needs to establish that they would not have suffered injury, or would have suffered less injury, if the accused State exercised cyber-diligence. Injury is not the decisive element. Breach is evaluated according to whether, at the origin of the injury, a State failed to do all it could to prevent the end result. As soon as a territorial State does not take all appropriate measures to stop a cyberattack, the cyber-diligence obligation has been violated.\nThe obligation, articulated in theory, does not capture the infinite scenarios which may arise in practice, including when:\n1. A lesser-able State puts their limited capacity to diligent use, doing all they can to stop a cyberattack.\n2. A State has sound cyber-capabilities in general, but is \"resource-poor\" at the time of the cyberattack. The State may have allocated intense resources to other priorities and is unable to terminate the cyberattack.\n3. A State with sound cyber-capabilities, both generally and at the time of a cyberattack, decides not to terminate the cyberattack.\n. Dupuy, supra note 69, at 379.\n.

BECKER, supra note 202, at 151-52.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nThese situations are highly abstract and all presuppose that a State has requisite knowledge and that the cyberattack causes serious injury. Variable factors across these situations determine breach. Assessment of breach ought to be “realistic and context-sensitive,” particularized to the circumstances in question. Theoretically, the State in situation (1) has exercised cyber-diligence to the extent of their capabilities, satisfying the obligation. The State in situation (3) has, by contrast, failed to do all it could to stop the cyberattack, and breaches their obligation. Situation (2) is less clear: international law does not dictate States’ domestic resource-allocation.\nIn reality, establishing responsibility is not straightforward. To evade responsibility, an accused State could claim:\n1. they exercised their best efforts, yet still failed to achieve a result in the face of new cyberattack methods;\n2. a lack of capacity at the time of a cyberattack, given other exigencies; or\n3. they lacked sufficient knowledge of the cyberattacks.\nThe accusing State then bears the unenviable burden of establishing breach.\nPredicting a breach of cyber-diligence with confidence is difficult. First, there is no minimum standard of cyber-diligence to measure compliance against. Second, a State’s acquiescence to a cyberattack is also likely to be covert and publicly denied. Third, cyber-diligence is a “moveable target”, constantly evolving as cyberspace technology develops.\n402.

Seabed Mining, Advisory Opinion, supra note 70, para. 117.\nLiu\nThe 2015 G.G.E. report recommended that the U.N. \"consider initiatives for international dialogue and exchange on ICT security issues.\" A C.D.C. which encompasses \"U.N. agencies, the private sector, academia and civil society organisations\" could facilitate best-practice exchanges. S.C. Resolution 1377 invited the C.T.C. to promote counter-terrorism best-practice and prepare model laws. A C.D.C. could do the same, and implicitly define an expected standard of care for cyber-diligence between member States.\nBest Management Practices (\"BMPs\") in counter-piracy provide a useful example of the best-practices approach to solving problems. Devised by the International Marine Organisation and the shipping industry, the BMPs increased vessels' successful resistance to piracy by 25%. Adopting these self-help recommendations (including such matters as speed, security equipment, and watchkeeping) were in the vessels' best interests. Compliance minimized insurance premiums and decreased the probability of pirate capture.\nThere is no guarantee that adopting and disseminating best-practice will achieve these results for cyber-diligence. Cyber-powers or private industries must be willing to share their (actual) best-practices before any dialogue improves cyber-diligence capabilities. Private industry could monetise cyberattack prevention capabilities and offer their services to the highest bidder. There is limited transparency in cybersecurity efforts: States and industry are unlikely to openly disclose the full extent of their technical capacity. Improving cyber-diligence may not be favourable to the geopolitical agendas of some\n408. Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications, U.N. Doc.

It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an \"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\" of serious consequences from a cyberattack. Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example. Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects. \"Serious attacks\" affecting network functionality are few and far between. But the Estonian and Georgian incidents demonstrate that they can occur.\nAt a minimum, to establish breaches of cyber-diligence, the victim\n. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 226.\n. Id. at 39; SUNSTEIN, supra note 80, at 120.\n. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 45.\nLiu\nState must produce clear and convincing evidence:\n1. of the territorial State's constructive knowledge, and;\n2. that the cyberattack caused category (1) (physical destruction) or category 2 (incapacitation) injury to objects or subjects within their territory.\nThe above elements establish a cyber-diligence framework. It is hoped that the framework matches States' concerns in practice and can guide their cybersecurity policies. Beijing and Washington, from our opening example, should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation in relation to defacement of each other's websites. Even if constructive knowledge can be established, the hacktivism did not cause injury of the requisite threshold to trigger the obligation.\nCyber-diligence will continue to be debated within academia before States employ relevant measures. It is hoped that this paper contributes a balanced response to the present scholarship.\nIV Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 191-260 (April 2017)\n\n# Footnotes from table in section III.D.\n1.

Live trackers record over 6 million cyberattacks daily. Information technology-dependent societies increasingly perceive cyber-threats as a destabilising force and citizens inevitably look to the State for protection. This paper concerns one form of State protection: whether States owe due diligence obligations in cyberspace under the laws of State responsibility. Specifically, it re-examines the contents of such an obligation and the circumstances which could trigger it in light of cyberattacks' peculiarities. A straightforward replication of due diligence models from international environmental law or law of the sea is not appropriate. But cyber-diligence should incorporate certain principles found within both models and channel ultimate responsibility for securing cyber-infrastructure onto private industry. Counter-terrorism obligations are the most useful body of law in which to seek an analogy. This paper argues that a State's cyber-diligence obligation is triggered, at a minimum, by: (1) constructive knowledge of a cyberattack, (2) which causes serious injury to an operating network. These contents and triggers define a cyber-diligence framework. Public pressure on the State and the market to intensify responses to transnational cyber-threats will drive the adoption of such principles.\nKeywords: Information Technology Law, Non-State Actors, Cyber War, National Security, Internet Governance.\nThis paper was initially written in partial fulfilment of my LLB at Monash University.

CASE STUDY: “PATRIOTIC” HACKTIVISTS¹ In April 2001, a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet collide over the South China Sea. The Chinese F-8 crashes, killing its pilot. Meanwhile, the U.S. plane makes an emergency landing on Hainan Island. China detains twenty-four U.S. crew members for eleven days in a military base.² A Sino-U.S. “cyber-war” commences.³ U.S. hackers retaliate against the crew’s detention, defacing Chinese websites with messages including: “first you China men try and take our plane and crew... what is next? Our home land? Our freedom?”⁴ In response, “patriotic” Chinese hacktivists strike back. In a self-branded “cyber-operation defending our country,”⁵ hacktivists deface U.S. “.gov” and “.com” websites,⁶ leaving messages, including: “long live Chinese nationality!”⁷ Notably, the hacktivists on both sides were private actors, who rationalized their actions as legitimate patriotic demonstrations.⁸ This fact has led some to speculate that the Chinese government’s information warfare strategy includes “sponsoring” Chinese hacktivists.⁹ The terminology Liu of\"sponsoring\"implies a form of state responsibility and insinuates that hacktivism may be attributed to China under the relevant tests in general international law.¹⁰ But attribution is only one possible test of State responsibility.\nWhat is a State's responsibility for its own actions or inaction during these cyberattacks?¹¹ A due diligence obligation in cyberspace¹² (\"cyber-diligence\"), if established, would offer victim States alternative legal recourse for a territorial State's breach of a primary obligation.¹³ Subject to the contents and triggers of the obligation defined below, China and the U.S. could invoke one another's responsibility for failing to prevent hacktivism within their territories.¹⁴ The failure could constitute an internationally wrongful act, which would then enable either State to seek reparations.¹⁵ The present paper uses hacktivism as its opening case study to canvass the issue of State responsibility in cyberattacks. We now turn to examine, starting from first principles, the merits of including a cyber-diligence obligation as part of the State responsibility framework.\n# A. Introduction\nCyberspace has “developed from [networks] of academic researchers into a mainstream communications mechanism.”¹⁶ Unfortunately, enhanced information flow results in the medium’s misuse. States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction.\nMany States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure.¹⁷ Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements.¹⁸ “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence”¹⁹ all work against custom crystallizing.²⁰ Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity\ncollaboration. Obliging each State to take all available measures to stop cyberattacks which emanate from their territories would improve the security of interconnected networks globally.²¹ Arguably, to date, no cyberattack has risen to the level of a use of force. Aggrieved States have not invoked State responsibility for a failure to prevent injurious cyberattacks. Yet, live trackers record over six million cyberattacks daily,²² and fear of cyber insecurity has gripped the world.²³ States increasingly invest in cyber capabilities to protect against escalations in cyberattack severity,²⁴ with cyberspace militarisation widely forecasted.²⁵ Some commentators opine that cyber weapons are the next “weapon of choice” for terrorism.²⁶ This kind of event could propel a global uptake and strict application of cyber-diligence. This paper evaluates the cyber-diligence discourse Liu in advance of such an event.²⁷ It aims to comprehensively define the contents and triggers of a cyber-diligence obligation, and offer reasoned conclusions which States could implement in practice. The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void.\nThe present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to\"peacetime\"cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack.²⁸ These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers.²⁹ Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State.\nFirst, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty. Cyber-diligence should be classified as an obligation of conduct. As the International Court of Justice (\"I.C.J.\") states:\"the obligation of States [is] to [employ] all means reasonably available to them\"³⁰ to prevent injurious activity. But a State does not incur responsibility “because the desired result is not achieved.”³¹ Second, we define the content of States’ cyber-diligence obligations, which should be distinct from due diligence obligations in environmental law.³² However, States should implement the polluter pays principle. Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts.\nThird, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network.\nFourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation. An objective standard of due diligence, defined through best-practice exchanges, could provide a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of States’ compliance.³³ But many States may not be ³¹ Id.; James Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N.

States also have different capabilities to intervene in cyberspace. As a result, their capacity should limit their responsibility.³⁴ Cyberattacks transcend exclusive territorial control.³⁵ But the threat does not necessitate a reinvention of international law.³⁶ The proposed cyber-diligence framework preserves State-centric responsibility in cyberspace,³⁷ extending post-Westphalian sovereignty to a relatively Hobbesian environment (which is barely 20 years old).³⁸ The author is hopeful that the present paper can contribute to international law as a project of imposing and maintaining “order through words, whether at sea or on land... or indeed in cyberspace.”³⁹\n# II. THE PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF DUE DILIGENCE IN STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## A. Due Diligence derives from Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace⁴⁰\nDue diligence is a corollary of States’ equal sovereignty.⁴¹ States enjoy plenary jurisdiction to control objects and subjects within their territory,⁴² but must also “respect . . . the territorial sovereignty and political integrity” of others.⁴³ Flowing from States’ reciprocal respect, the I.C.J. famously articulated the due diligence obligation: “it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴ Due diligence, accordingly, has developed into a general principle of international law.⁴⁵\nCyber-diligence applies the due diligence obligation to cyberspace specifically.⁴⁶ States should exercise cyber-diligence over cyber activity within their “legal or regulatory control.”⁴⁷ It is the concept of territorial sovereignty which underpins all due diligence obligations.⁴⁸ But what is “territory” in cyberspace, when the realm has no physical boundaries?\nReferences to cyberspace in this paper adopt a dualistic character: the virtual domain which facilitates internet communications and the physical hardware sustaining the domain’s operation.⁴⁹ Cyberspace, as an intangible medium, can only exist inside tangible infrastructure.⁵⁰ It operates via “networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures”⁵¹ located within a State’s territory.⁵² Within their territory, States enjoy exclusive legal authority over: (1) cyber-infrastructure; (2) cyber-activity associated with their cyberinfrastructure, and; (3) persons engaged in cyber activity.⁵³ States should also bear a primary due diligence obligation to ensure that their infrastructure is not used to harm the equal sovereignty of other States.⁵⁴ A State’s failure to exercise due diligence should constitute an internationally wrongful act.⁵⁵ Some States resist the idea of cyber-diligence obligations, avoiding additional burdens on their resources and perceived overregulation of cyberspace.56 Others firewall domestic internet, creating a\"closed national network\"averse to foreign influence.57 Cyber-diligence's current generality renders it extant in theory, but an afterthought in practice.\nThis section identifies the source of cyber-diligence obligations. But States ought to be informed of what positive actions fulfil the obligation (Section III) and when these actions should be undertaken (Section IV). First, this paper explores a characteristic of due diligence obligations: strong in adaptability but weak in enforcement.\n# III. CONTENTS OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION ## A. Obligation of Conduct versus Obligation of Result58 Due diligence is a\"relative, not absolute,\"59 obligation of conduct. States have the discretion to adopt any feasible measures to prevent cyberattacks injuring other States,60\"without warranting that the [attacks] will not occur.\"61 Breach of the obligation turns on whether a territorial State took all appropriate measures to protect the victim TY: THE GENERAL PART 227 (2013).\nLiu State from attack.⁶² Whether the territorial State had “genuine capacity to avert the threat” in the circumstances informs the assessment.⁶³ Due diligence obligations differ from obligations of result, which require that a State must prevent the occurrence of a cyberattack, regardless of the means employed.⁶⁴ These obligations represent a State’s absolute guarantee to reach a precise outcome.⁶⁵ Imposing an obligation of result in cyber-diligence would likely require States to adopt burdensome practices. Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.⁶⁶ ## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty Obligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States.⁶⁷ The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States.⁶⁸ In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence... into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”⁶⁹ ⁶².

Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Reviewing the Difficulties of Codification: On Ago’s Classification of Obligations of Means and Obligations of Result in Relation to State Responsibility, 10 EUR. J. INT’L L. 371, 375 (1999).\nHowever, an obligation of conduct's elasticity has deficiencies. First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks.⁷⁰ Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation.⁷¹ Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.”⁷² As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises.⁷³ The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”⁷⁴ Cyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”,⁷⁵ establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained... the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”⁷⁶ This paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature.⁷⁷ But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework.\n⁷⁰.

Cyber-Diligence should not adopt the Preventive Principle We begin our examination with the preventive principle, a significant element within established due diligence models. The principle requires States to take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of transboundary damage where the risk is known.78 Preventive cyber-diligence would oblige States to create and maintain a clean infrastructural environment, in advance of any cyberattacks.79 We will not address the precautionary principle, which applies in the absence of scientific certainty that a risk will cause harm.80 It is settled that cyberattacks could cause serious injury.81 Some commentators82—and a U.N. Working Group83—posit that States should undertake preventive cyber-diligence.84 The suggestions include:85\nLiu\nA number of these procedural steps constitute custom in international environmental law.[87] While these measures could obviate transboundary harm, they would do little to suppress ongoing or imminent cyberattacks. For instance, risk assessment identifies vulnerable networks. States could secure these networks, improve long-term network health, and make future cyberattacks harder to execute.[88] But risk assessment would do little to reduce injuries from a cyberattack that is underway. Hacktivists can launch attacks from infrastructure in States with lower cybersecurity,[89] diverting the source but not the effect of the eventual injury.[90] Another preventive measure could be to destroy malicious software (\"malware\") capable of being\"weaponized\"in a cyberattack. But nearly 200,000 new malware codes are identified daily.[91] The negligible effects of\"search and destroy\"operations do not warrant State expenditure.[92] Preventive measures are of minimal use when cyberattacks penetrate computer networks and cause instant injury. The territorial State should assist instead in the\"rescue effort\". They should engage skilled experts INCIDENTS: LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 60-61 (2010).\nLiu to alleviate bandwidth limitations, isolate the malicious data causing actual injury in the victim State, and cooperate in investigations.⁹³ Below, we revisit the preventive principle's origins in international environmental law. We shall demonstrate that a State's preventive duties should be confined to the circumstances in which it arose, transboundary environmental harm.⁹⁴ ## C. International Environmental Law This subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence.\nScholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of\"noxious activity\"and prevention of\"information pollution.\"⁹⁵ The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the\"no harm\"principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas).⁹⁶ States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State.⁹⁷ In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed:\"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory... to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another...\n⁹³.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of\"natural resources... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the\"neighbouring State\"concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103 We dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State. A cyberattack can be directed from any distant location connected to the internet and traverse numerous States before it harms a network.¹⁰⁵ Second, the I.C.J.'s jurisprudential promotion of the preventive principle aims to secure the environment's long term sustainability and avoid disturbance to its ecological balance.¹⁰⁶ Environmental damage cannot easily be undone.¹⁰⁷ The harm's irreversibility underpins societies' willingness to adopt aggressive steps to control the perceived risk.¹⁰⁸ This rationale is not transferable to cyberspace. Cyberspace, still in its infancy, has seemingly infinite resources.¹⁰⁹ Permanent cyberspace degradation is not an issue: servers can be restored after attacks and security breaches can be repaired. At worst, physical infrastructure and data destroyed in a cyberattack still would not affect the overall functioning of the cyberspace domain.\nStates have no impetus to restrict private actors from\"polluting\"cyberspace. The\"tragedy of the commons\"theory reasons that\"we are locked into a system of fouling our own nest\".¹¹⁰ This is because the cost of the waste\"[a person] discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying [her] wastes.\"¹¹¹ We do not foul the cyberspace\"nest\"because no amount of\"cyberwaste\"can (currently) overload and inhibit cyberspace functions. The medium fosters independent gain without fear of endangering the cyberspace platform.\nThe\"polluter pays\"principle should be applied to shift the duty of prevention onto private industry. (This should sit alongside States criminalising cyber-offences for individual liability.) As Alan Boyle suggests,\"it may be simpler, quicker, and economically more efficient to make polluters... pay rather than States.\"¹¹² State regulations should ¹⁰⁵.

The\"Polluter Pays\"Principle Should Be Adopted The Rio Declaration defines the polluter pays principle:\"national authorities should endeavour to promote the internalisation of environmental costs... the polluter should, in principle, bear the costs of pollution.\"Municipal law and State responsibility should jointly account for injuries from cyberattacks. States' cyber-diligence obligations should include implementing domestic criminal and civil liability. This would harmonize the interests of territorial States (to avoid full liability) and victim States (to access legal redress at the domestic and international levels).\nFirst, States should identify the cyber-polluter(s) to which liability attaches. In environmental law, liability attaches to the operator causing pollution, but also\"on other people specifically identified as being at the origin of the damage.\"Civilly liable persons include, for example, the carrier of dangerous goods contaminating the environment, and the owner of a ship from which polluting oil escaped.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\nIn cyberspace, the polluter's\"payment\"should expand beyond monetary compensation (damages or taxes) to individual civil and criminal liability. The\"cyber-polluter\"should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable.\nSecond, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to\"threat intelligence\"companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence,\"cyber-pollution\"should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126] Directing a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for\"cyber-pollution\"incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability. Consumer perception of network owners' cyber vulnerability could result in reputational and stock-price hits. The 45, entered into force May 30, 1996.\nmarket itself incentivises network owners to adopt cybersecurity.¹²⁷ State regulation should reinforce economic deterrence: “unclean” network owners should not receive government tenders and private contracts.¹²⁸ But emphasising private law reparations would have downsides. First, a private liability regime could dilute State responsibility, moving questions of cyber-diligence from public international law into private international law.¹²⁹ The principle risks “exonerating certain subjects of international law from their share of responsibility for damage” caused by cyberattacks.¹³⁰ Second, civil liability does “not always [guarantee] real compensation for the damage caused to the environment.”¹³¹ A compensation scheme does not rectify the damage already caused to networks. To counter this inadequacy, States ought to take positive steps to terminate cyberattacks that are in progress and mitigate injury as far as possible. They should also bear cooperation duties to help restore injured networks post-cyberattack.¹³² In limited State practice, victim States readily initiate prosecution under domestic criminal laws after they ascertain a hacker’s identity. In 2007, cyberattacks targeted Estonia’s government websites, e-services, and information infrastructure after Estonia removed a Soviet-era memorial.¹³³ Attack methods included denial of service (“DOS”),¹³⁴ ¹²⁷.

After the onslaught, Estonia sought to subject alleged hackers to computer sabotage crimes in their Penal Code.¹³⁶ The U.S. has also prosecuted five Chinese hackers under their criminal code, despite the hackers being identified as members of the Chinese military,¹³⁷ and by extension, carrying out official State organ functions.¹³⁸ But successful investigation and prosecution requires “dual criminality” of the cyberattack offence in both the victim State and the perpetrator’s domicile State.¹³⁹ If the domicile State has not criminalized cyberattacks, they are unlikely to extradite their national for prosecution.¹⁴⁰ Gathering sufficient evidence to prosecute would also be difficult: the victim State needs to access information held by the domicile State.¹⁴¹ For example, Russia refused to assist Estonia to identify hackers with Russian IP addresses.¹⁴² This occurred despite their bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.¹⁴³ This subsection demonstrates that the preventive principle should not be adopted in States’ cyber-diligence. Rather, despite its shortcomings, States should use the polluter pays principle to pressure industry to improve cybersecurity. States should implement the principle into domestic law as part of their cyber-diligence obligation.\nHaving established that the due diligence obligation in environmental law does not fit with cyberspace, we visit another possible analogy for cyber-diligence: due diligence in the marine environment. As is taken up later, cyberspace, unlike the high seas, is not a res communis. An analogy with the marine environment also impractically extends the scope of cyber-diligence obligations to nationals outside territorial control. But it provides guidance for an adequate regulatory framework in cyber-diligence.\n## D. International Law of the Sea Part XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"UNCLOS\") enshrines States' due diligence obligations within the marine environment. Article 192 establishes the general obligation to\"protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁴ Under Article 193, States enjoy the sovereign right to exploit natural resources, but must also take measures to prevent pollution to the marine environment.¹⁴⁵ Several differences arise when applying due diligence obligations in the marine environment compared to cyberspace. First, due diligence obligations under UNCLOS do not exclusively attach to sovereignty.¹⁴⁶ Vessels may operate in areas where States enjoy mutual rights. Articles 192 and 193 oblige flag States to ensure conservation of living resources, including in the exclusive economic zones of other States.¹⁴⁷ To discharge this obligation, flag States ought to ensure vessels within their jurisdiction and control\"do not undermine [their] obligations... to protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁸ The arbitral ¹⁴⁴.

A State’s cyber-diligence obligation should not extend to terminating a cyberattack initiated by a national abroad.¹⁵² In the sea, a flag vessel’s physical location is identifiable. A State’s due diligence obligation follows their flag vessels’ chartered territory. In cyberspace, a State exercises authority over infrastructure within their exclusive control both in their territory and extraterritorially.¹⁵³ But a State’s jurisdictional control of their nationals assumes different characteristics. The operations of transnational non-State actors (and their data trails) are often borderless, simultaneously residing in multiple jurisdictions.¹⁵⁴ ¹⁴⁹.

Id. rule 2 cmt para. 3.\nConsider the diagram: a national of State A, physically located in State B, usurps networks in States C and D to launch attacks. For State A to terminate the cyberattacks, it needs to access networks in States C and D (constituting prohibited interference, unless States C and D grant consent). In this situation, besides a duty of cooperation to assist a victim State's investigations of their national, State A should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation to terminate the cyberattack.\nSeparately, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea's (\"ITLOS\") Seabed Disputes Advisory Opinion articulates internal laws and regulations which States ought to adopt to fulfil due diligence obligations.[156] UNCLOS places due diligence obligations on States who engage contractors for projects within international waters (sponsoring States).[157] Sponsoring States are required to\"[adopt] laws Liu and regulations and [take] administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction.”¹⁵⁸ The following table distils principles from ITLOS’ advisory opinion, summarising how they may be applied to cyber-diligence.¹⁵⁹ These suggestions should be read in light of the “cyber-polluter pays” argument.¹⁶⁰ The same due diligence principles apply under UNCLOS and environmental law, demonstrating their uniformity.\nvisory Opinion, supra note 70, paras 124-50; Southern Bluefin Tuna, supra note 100, para. 77; see infra, III.C. and V.\n¹⁵⁸.

See infra, III.C.\n|  Extracted Principles | Cyber-Diligence Application  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (1) To fulfil due diligence obligations, sponsoring States must enact laws, regulations, and administrative measures enforcing the obligations of contractors.1 Contractual arrangements are insufficient.2 | Territorial States should: (1) criminalise cyberattacks causing serious injury in foreign territory and; (2) incentivise network owners to secure infrastructure.  |\n|  (2) “[The obligations] may include [establishing] enforcement mechanisms for active supervision of the activities of the sponsored contractor.”3 | States should:○ In grants and tenders, prioritise corporations with clean “track records” or those diligently securing their networks. These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases.  |\n|  (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity.  |\nLiu\nThese measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State,¹⁶¹ and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity.\nCyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured.\nInternational cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked.\n## E.

For example, a bilateral agreement between Russia and Estonia enshrined “obligations” to transfer evidence, assist in investigations, and extradite alleged perpetrators of criminal offences.¹⁶⁹ In spite of this, Russia refused to assist Estonia’s investigations after the 2007 cyberattacks. Russia’s interpretation of the treaty excluded surveillance measures identifying a perpetrator’s physical location.¹⁷⁰ A restrictive interpretation conceals, perhaps, a lack of cooperative will.¹⁷¹ Some States possibly favour a poorly regulated cyberspace.¹⁷² States can leverage assistance to gain traction with allies, or refuse TY PLANNING (2016), http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Security-Planning/; EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY, EUROPEAN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENCE (EP3R) (2009) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies; German Federal Office for Information Security, IT-Grundschutz (2016), https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/; Shackleford, supra note 20, at 29.\n¹⁶⁵.

Conversely, States may not seek or provide assistance for fear of exposing their cyber vulnerabilities or cyber-technology.[173] Cooperative duties nonetheless need to be\"clear, useful, and doable.\"[174] To complement current regimes, they ought to immediately contain a cyberattack. States should commission cybersecurity experts,[175] and: Experts could be exchanged between contracting agencies within cooperating States.[176] Each State could mobilize experts from multiple jurisdictions if cyberattacks occurred or if their private sector demanded increased protection. States with cyber-monitoring capabilities may warn others, in advance, of increased malicious traffic indicating imminent cyberattack(s).[177] A target State can then boost network capacity in anticipation. In ongoing cyberattacks, assisting States may host servers, transfer bandwidth, and eliminate botnet traffic.\nBut these suggestions remain aspirational. First, duties to co-operate are obligations of conduct\"formulated in a relatively weak way,\"[178] which do not drive outcomes. In Southern Bluefin Tuna, a treaty obligation required parties to\"consult, [and] resolve the dispute by negotiation or other peaceful means of their own choice.\"[179] The parties were only Liu obliged to continue to seek settlement through negotiation, rather than coming to an actual settlement.¹⁸⁰ A unilateral referral of the dispute to judicial settlement or arbitration was ineffective.¹⁸¹ Indeed, as the Estonia-Russia Treaty illustrates, States exercise discretion in their adherence to a cooperation treaty.¹⁸² Second, some commentators stress that States bear a legal obligation to cooperate in reducing cyber threats, as cyberspace integrity is relevant to international security.¹⁸³ Katharina Ziolkowski argues: “the internet presents another global resource [which is] in the common interest of the international community.”¹⁸⁴ We ought to exercise caution before suggesting cooperative duties that have arisen within the natural environment or the seabed¹⁸⁵ apply to cyberspace.\nUnlike the high seas,¹⁸⁶ or outer space,¹⁸⁷ cyberspace is not a “common concern of humankind” (res communis).¹⁸⁸ States recognize a res communis when: (1) exploitation of accumulated resources benefits each State; and (2) collective governance serves greater utility compared Tuna (N.Z. v. Japan; Austl. v. Japan), 38 I.L.M. 1624, 1647 (Judge ad hoc Shearer).\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\nto dividing the space into smaller parts.¹⁸⁹ Cyberspace is not a natural, indivisible asset. Each State is encouraged to invest in cyberspace to reap economic, political, and social benefits.¹⁹⁰ States currently have no incentive to agree on a common regulatory regime in cyberspace. Doing so would decrease their margin of appreciation to set cyberspace priorities. Any common interests in cyberspace fasten on ensuring the platform's development, so that each State can advance their private interest. States increasingly “[establish sovereign control] in the virtual world in the name of security and economic sustainability.”¹⁹¹ Third, cooperative efforts will likely be limited to agreements between politically aligned States. The European Union has initiated best-practice and cyber-intelligence exchanges.¹⁹² The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology collaborates with “the U.K., Japan, Korea, Estonia, Israel and Germany” to spread best practice in domestic cybersecurity.¹⁹³ Perhaps this paper’s assessment of international cooperation appears overly negative. Initially, the above passages may indicate international law is epiphenomenal, allowing powerful States to grant their cooperation at will.¹⁹⁴ However, we do not endorse a realist perspective which refutes the normative value of *pacta sunt servanda*.¹⁹⁵ Our critique questions whether current cooperation regimes are effective in the face of a particular cyberattack. Expecting obligations of cooperation to bring utopian cybersecurity will inevitably disappoint. But the value of regional and multilateral cooperation schemes to improving cybersecurity cannot be ignored.^[196]^ As the Estonian incident demonstrates,^[197]^ the effectiveness of multilateral conventions in a cyberattack depends on a signatory's willingness to assist under those circumstances. Failure to assist incurs no enforceable sanction,^[198]^ but these conventions could spur domestic cybersecurity adoption.^[199]^ The fact that some States already cooperate through treaties demonstrates the effect of international law.^[200]^ As James Crawford states,\"like good coffee, international law has to be brewed.\"^[201]^ The cybersecurity coffee is yet percolating.\nCooperative duties are process-driven, limiting their ability to achieve outcomes. However, a central consultative body that facilitates cooperation could spark increases in cyber-diligence capacity. We turn to counter-terrorism for direction. The next subsection defines the similarities between cyberattacks and terrorism and argues that cyber-diligence should resemble Resolution 1373's counter-terrorism model of due diligence. Adoption of this model would be conditional on an event which heightens expectations of States' compliance with cyber-diligence obligations.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n# F.

The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed.²⁰² We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\"²⁰³ A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.²⁰⁴\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats.²⁰⁵ These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law.²⁰⁶ They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory.²⁰⁷ Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n²⁰² Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear... to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.”²⁰⁸ A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.²⁰⁹ ## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison International law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network”²¹⁰ without a formal hierarchy.²¹¹ Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”.²¹² Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.²¹³ Anonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.”²¹⁴ The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream, Liu political correctness.²¹⁵ Like Al-Qaeda, Anonymous has a decentralized command system. Its\"ops\"begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to\"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling\"anons\"into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites.²¹⁶ In 2012,\"anons\"initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline.\"Operation Anti-ACTA\"responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.²¹⁷ Anonymous proclaimed that the agreement\"[enslaves] the internet.\"²¹⁸ While the government website was down, Polish politicians opposed to the agreement wore Guy Fawkes masks (the symbol of the Anonymous movement) in Parliament.²¹⁹ Private actors domiciled across different States accomplish Al-Qaeda and Anonymous'\"successes\". They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.",
    "# 3. Incorporating the Counter-Terrorism Model of Due Diligence": "States bear an obligation to prevent the terrorist conduct of non-State actors. The obligation existed within custom and conventions well before 9/11.²²⁰ However, this paper focuses on the counter-terrorism standard of due diligence established within Resolution 1373.\nIn handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.”²²¹ States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.”²²² The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.²²³\nResolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations.²²⁴ States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation).²²⁵ These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security,²²⁶ which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.²²⁷\n²²⁰.

Security Council and\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\nResolution 1373 established the Counter-Terrorism Committee (\"C.T.C.\") and required\"all States to report to the Committee... on the steps they have taken to implement this resolution.\"²²⁸ The C.T.C. initiated a transnational\"capacity building blitz\".²²⁹ The S.C. should similarly establish a Cyber-Diligence Committee (\"C.D.C.\"). First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks.\n## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision Resolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures.²³⁰ The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies,²³¹ and does not enforce sanctions on those who\"fail\"to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment.\nThe U.N. General Assembly has established the Group of Governmental Experts in Information Security (\"G.G.E.\"), signalling an intention to centralise cybersecurity efforts.²³² The Group outlines International Terrorism, in Bianchi &amp; Naqvi eds, supra note 26, at 83-92; see also SUNSTEIN, supra note 85, at 123.\nthat:\"States... should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit [internationally wrongful acts] using ICTs.\"²³³ As a result, 25 States have tabled reports on their internal cybersecurity policies.²³⁴ The U.N. should go beyond inviting open-ended cybersecurity reports and establish a C.D.C. to regulate international capacity building efforts for cyber-diligence. The C.D.C's overall goal should be to assist (particularly developing) States building capacity to prevent cyberattacks. A gradual improvement in capacity throughout all 191 U.N. member States could decrease the frequency of cyberattacks, although this will take time, and requires ample financial resources.²³⁵ The C.D.C's specific functions should resemble those of the C.T.C.: appoint experts to advise States on cyber-diligence compliance,²³⁶ coordinate assistance between donors and donees,²³⁷ and elicit compulsory written reports on States' capacity building measures. A C.D.C. reduces the discretion of States to determine appropriate measures for cyber-diligence. Through reviews, the C.D.C. should implicitly set a due diligence standard for States to meet in acquiring capacity. A C.D.C. should stress the relative nature of cyber-diligence and not stretch the obligation into one of absolute prevention.²³⁸ (It should centralize responsibility for co-ordinating cyber-diligence efforts, but preserve due diligence as an obligation of conduct.)\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\nHowever, a capacity-building focus has limitations. It risks creating a disparity between States' reported capacity and their actual exercise of that capacity.²³⁹ Unresolved tensions include: In the counter-terrorism context, Tal Becker proposes that due diligence standards should apply to a State: Becker’s proposed standards should be incorporated into States’ cyber-diligence obligations. The C.D.C. should supervise States’ compliance with limb (1). States who fail to notify the C.D.C. of their capacity deficits should be disentitled from pleading a lack of capacity if a subsequent cyberattack implicates their networks.²⁴³ This approach limits the responsibility of unable but willing States for a particular cyberattack, provided they have fulfilled limb (1) to the extent of their capacity. Other domestic exigencies may militate against ²³⁹. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128.\n²⁴⁰. U.N. Charter art. 2(7).\n²⁴¹.

BECKER, supra note 209, at 146.\n²³⁰ Liu a State's exercise of cyber-diligence capabilities.²⁴⁴ If so, a State should not be held in violation of limb (2), taking into account the particular circumstances at the time of the cyberattack.\nIf *able but unwilling* States simply ignore limb (2), establishing a failure to exercise cyber-diligence would be relatively straightforward. However, difficulties arise where *able but unwilling* States exercise cyber-diligence “half-heartedly”. For instance, a State could neutralise a third of the total botnets emanating from their territory (when they have the capacity to terminate the entire cyberattack).²⁴⁵ To establish violation, the victim State ought to prove that the territorial State did not employ their full capacity to prevent the cyberattack.²⁴⁶ There is no “quick fix” to these tensions. Nonetheless, a C.D.C. should introduce an internationally calibrated strategy to capacity building in cyber-diligence. Far from being merely theoretical, 159 States have received counter-terrorism assistance as a result of the C.T.C.²⁴⁷ A C.D.C. realises the UN’s role of equipping States with the *capacity for* cyber-diligence,²⁴⁸ but not overstepping its intergovernmental character to intervene in States’ actual exercise of cyber-diligence.²⁴⁹ This section argues that the contents of a State’s cyber-diligence obligation should include: (1) the “cyber-polluter pays” principle; (2) implementing regulations for industry to secure infrastructure, and; (3) capacity-building via consultation with the C.D.C. But States ought to know what circumstances enliven their obligation to fulfil these contents. The following section considers the two key triggers of cyber-diligence obligations: knowledge and injury.",
    "# IV. TRIGGERING THE DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE": "A. Does Actual or Constructive Knowledge Trigger Cyber-Diligence?\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, a sovereign's responsibility for their subjects' actions consists of \"forbearance\" and \"protection shewn to transgressions.\"²⁵⁰ The sovereign must: (1) know of the transgression and; (2) fail to prevent or punish the delinquency.\nKnowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility.²⁵¹ States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it.²⁵² Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury.²⁵³ There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion.²⁵⁴ A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.²⁵⁵\nThis paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:\n- a State ought to have known of a cyberattack, or; - a State had information on a cyberattack, and was obliged to undertake further inquiries, but failed to do so; Categories (1) – (2) constitute subjective knowledge, while categories (3) – (4) amount to constructive (objective) knowledge. First, we demonstrate that all four categories should suffice to trigger cyber-diligence. Second, we suggest an appropriate standard of proof to establish a territorial State’s knowledge before an international court or tribunal (“international tribunal”).\n## 1. Subjective Knowledge is Difficult to Establish ### i. Categories 1 and 2 Subjective knowledge is the highest degree of intent. A State either intended the cyberattack to cause serious injury, or endorsed the outcome. In judicial proceedings, victim States may struggle to establish a territorial State’s actual knowledge or connivance. The accused State’s sovereignty shrouds any evidence of subjective knowledge in secrecy. It is unthinkable that an accused State would surrender documents ²⁵⁶. Constantine Antonopoulos, *State Responsibility in Cyberspace*, in *Tsagourias &amp; Buchan eds*, supra note 35, at 69.\n²⁵⁷. BROWNLIE, supra note 252, at 45, 152-53; Corfu Channel (U.K. v. Alb.), 1949 I.C.J. Rep. 4, para. 85 (Apr. 9) (Judge Azevedo).\nLiu revealing internal decisions,²⁵⁸ especially given the lack of discovery procedures in State-on-State litigation.\nSome commentators posit that knowledge only arises when victim States notify territorial States of cyberattacks.²⁵⁹ In Tehran Hostages, the I.C.J. relied on notification to infer Iran's actual knowledge of militant raids. Iran was\"fully aware... of the urgent need for action,\"²⁶⁰ given\"repeated calls for help\"to the Iranian Foreign Ministry.²⁶¹ Iran's inaction was\"due to more than mere negligence or lack of appropriate means.\"²⁶² However, victim States rarely notify territorial States of a cyberattack. Notification consumes time, does little to reduce injury, and tarnishes inter-State relations. Instead, a State will likely devote their resources to withstanding a cyberattack. In the Estonian incident, botnet infiltrations implicated computers in 178 countries.²⁶³ Estonia did not notify one territorial State. Instead, Estonia increased bandwidth capacity (so networks could handle increased traffic), filtered malicious transmissions, and engaged U.S. and N.A.T.O. assistance to terminate sources of the attack.²⁶⁴ Some territorial States voluntarily neutralized sources of attacks.²⁶⁵ In 2008, Georgia and Russia engaged in armed conflict over the South Ossetia region. Georgia suffered concurrent cyberattacks on their governmental, commercial and media networks, (supposedly) coordinated via Russian infrastructure.²⁶⁶ Georgia, a\"cyber-locked\"State, relied on neighbouring States' cyber infrastructure to facilitate their internal traffic.²⁶⁷ The primary channel for Georgia's internet connectivity flowed through Russia.²⁶⁸ Georgia did not notify Russia of the cyberattacks, instead relocating important servers to the U.S.²⁶⁹ Google's secure servers temporarily hosted a news portal,²⁷⁰ and NATO also secured Georgian networks.²⁷¹ If only notification could enliven knowledge, then no cyber-diligence could ever be triggered in incidents like the cyberattacks on Estonia and Georgia. Victim States mitigate loss and boost defences when a cyberattack begins. Politically allied States disable attack sources and offer relief networks.²⁷² Victim States do not benefit from notification.\nThe knowledge threshold to trigger cyber-diligence should be lowered. Kimberley Trapp argues (in the counter-terrorism context):\"requiring proof of subjective knowledge would effectively act as a bar to any finding of responsibility for a failure to prevent.\"²⁷³ A territorial State's cyber-diligence obligation should be triggered if they\"ought to have known\"of a cyberattack.\n## 2. Constructive Knowledge Should Trigger Cyber-Diligence Obligations ### i. Category 3 International jurisprudence supports constructive knowledge triggering due diligence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J's majority judgment relied on a series of inferences to conclude that the minefield laying\"could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of Albania.\"²⁷⁴ The majority inferred Albania's knowledge according to objective standards.\n²⁶⁷.

Corfu Channel, supra note 44, at 19-20.\nLiu The U.K. was not required to prove Albania knew (subjectively) of the mines' presence.²⁷⁵ Notably, two dissentients (Judge Azevedo and Judge Krylov) held Albania was under a continuous duty to inform itself of reasonably foreseeable threats in its territory,²⁷⁶ or, as Ian Brownlie argues, “[to] take reasonable care to discover activities of trespassers.”²⁷⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the I.C.J. found that a State’s obligation to prevent the occurrence of genocide is engaged “at the instant that the State learns of, or should normally have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.”²⁷⁸ Engaging the obligation to prevent genocide is tantamount to triggering cyber-diligence if the State should have reasonably known of the attack’s occurrence.²⁷⁹ In Asian Agricultural Products, the Tribunal emphasized Sri Lanka bore a duty to exercise “[an] ‘objective’ standard of vigilance in assessing the required degree of protection and security... for foreign investors.”²⁸⁰ The language of these cases suggest that constructive knowledge should be established if the territorial State had information that a cyberattack might occur and failed to conduct further inquiries.\nElsewhere, some commentators argue constructive knowledge should be presumed when a cyberattack implicates a State’s exclusive governmental infrastructure.²⁸¹ The aggrieved State ought to establish that the attack travelled through the territorial State’s governmental infrastructure.²⁸² Constructive knowledge is prima facie established if the infrastructure was under direct State control and used only for public purposes.283 This approach should be tempered. Indications of government infrastructure's involvement in a cyberattack can be deceiving. First, non-State hackers may compromise a government server.284 A cyberattack being mounted from government infrastructure does not in itself establish responsibility in the cyber context.285 Second, cyberattacks are often dressed with\"spoofing\"(identify manipulation) techniques. In the Estonian incident, spoofing clouded evidence which incriminated Moscow's exclusive infrastructure: unknown perpetrators could have adopted the veil of a Moscow government computer.286 Often,\"onion routing\"techniques are used to conceal perpetrators' identity.287 The majority of cyberattacks use such masquerading tactics.288 Even if network logs suggest a cyberattack exploited government infrastructure, the victim State should still be bound to adduce evidence to dismiss spoofing concerns.\nSome commentators stretch the presumption of constructive knowledge further. They advocate a reverse presumptio juris whenever a cyberattack is associated with government infrastructure,289 or when\"injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State.\"290 International tribunals would shift the burden of proof onto the territorial State, who must disprove their presumed constructive knowledge.291\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\nReversal of the burden of proof conflicts with I.C.J. jurisprudence.²⁹² In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J. did not infer Albania's constructive knowledge of injurious activity purely based on their exclusive territorial control. Territorial control does not “[shift] the burden of proof... in relation to unlawful acts perpetrated therein.”²⁹³ In Pulp Mills, the I.C.J. stated “a preventive approach... does not [operate] as a reversal of the burden of proof.”²⁹⁴ It is not for the territorial State to prove its diligence. State control over governmental networks only gives rise to “abstract and immaterial knowledge” of a cyberattack, insufficient to presume State responsibility.²⁹⁵ But victim States may use the accused State's control over government infrastructure as evidence. Section IV.A.3. explains how a pattern of such evidence should establish constructive knowledge. But first, we examine how constructive knowledge would operate under category 4.\n## ii. Category 4 With reference to Section III.F.3., should a C.D.C. framework be established, a degree of constructive knowledge should be presumed. Territorial States would be held to a standard of vigilance in maintaining their cyber-territory, and constructive knowledge of an ongoing or imminent attack would be imputed to these States. States would have less latitude to plead a lack of capacity to discover a particular cyberattack.\nPresuming knowledge would reflect heightened expectations for State compliance with cyber-diligence obligations.²⁹⁶ The victim State still bears the burden of proof²⁹⁷ and should establish knowledge to a clear and convincing standard to discharge their burden in an international tribunal.\n## 3. Overcoming the Evidentiary Hurdle: Standard of Proof Typically, a failure in due diligence will be raised after the victim State (“applicant”) suffers injury. The issue turns to causation. How does the applicant gather sufficient evidence to establish that actual or constructive knowledge triggered the territorial State’s (“respondent”) cyber-diligence obligation?²⁹⁸ The applicant will struggle to establish their case absent the respondent’s assistance or at least consent to evidence collection.²⁹⁹ The I.C.J. acknowledges that victim States face evidentiary difficulties, allowing a “more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence... provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.”³⁰⁰ But the standard of proof in an international tribunal should not be lowered “simply because it is... difficult to reach.”³⁰¹ The standard “[protects] the respondent against false attribution... a particularly serious risk in the cyber context.”³⁰² The applicant must produce reliable and neutral evidence to establish that the respondent at least ought to have known of the cyberattack.³⁰³ They could rely on experts to adduce logs of the respondent’s network behaviour during the cyberattack.³⁰⁴ An international tribunal may OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE: A COMMENTARY 1245 (Andreas Zimmermann et al. eds, 2012).\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\ncommission its own experts to evaluate the reliability of such evidence.³⁰⁵ The applicant may also produce documentary data and press reports³⁰⁶ to establish the respondent had sufficient information to make further inquiries into the cyberattack, but failed to do so.\nSome commentators advocate for a “very liberal approach to evidence [in cyberspace].”³⁰⁷ They contrast the anonymity of cyberattacks against kinetic threats, which are physically traceable, before, during, and after the attack.³⁰⁸ However, the primary rule invoked in a matter determines the standard of proof.³⁰⁹ International tribunals should not adopt a low standard of proof in due diligence matters. As Durward Sandifer argues: “in dealing with sovereign States... it cannot lightly be presumed that one of the parties to the litigation is guilty of negligence.”³¹⁰ Doing so may result in evidence of low probative value establishing a breach of due diligence, which would undercut the presumption that States observe international law.³¹¹ Conversely, the standard of proof should not be so “unduly exacting” that it becomes impossible to meet.³¹² Rep. 2014 (Mar. 31), p. 226, 237 paras 18-20, 255-57 paras 73-82, 283 paras 188-90, 290-93 paras 217-227; The South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of Philippines v.

The applicant ought to produce\"sufficiently clear\"³¹³ and weighty evidence to meet the standard.³¹⁴ The applicant could realistically gather sufficient evidence to establish a reasonable inference of the respondent's constructive knowledge.³¹⁵ The standard also precludes international tribunals finding violations of international law based on unconvincing evidence,³¹⁶ especially given these proceedings rarely have appeal mechanisms.³¹⁷ However, cyberattacks may regularly implicate governmental cyber-infrastructure in particular States.³¹⁸ This paper argues that an applicant establishes constructive knowledge to a clear and convincing standard if it adduces evidence of: Greenwood).\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\nPropensity then assists an applicant to overcome a lack of probative evidence if confronted with an uncooperative territorial State. It also incentivizes States to secure (at least) their governmental infrastructure. But the approach does not prejudice States who lack the capacity to safeguard their governmental infrastructure.³²⁰ Questions of a State's actual or constructive knowledge are contingent on a judicial forum's evidentiary standards. Together, they form the\"knowledge\"element to trigger cyber-diligence obligations. A threshold of constructive knowledge proven to a clear and convincing standard has been advanced. This paper now turns to the second trigger-element: injury.\n## B. What Level of Injury Engages A Cyber-Diligence Duty?\nInjury is not a pre-requisite to finding an internationally wrongful act under the laws of State responsibility.³²¹ Once a breach is attributed to a State, responsibility is potentially engaged, subject to application of the primary rule.³²² In the context of due diligence, however, damage is a condition to finding a violation of the primary rule.³²³ A State who failed to exercise cyber-diligence is only liable for breaching the primary rule after hostile acts, contrary to another State's legal rights, occur.³²⁴ When\"due diligence is violated, there is an attribution to the State... of the consequences of the acts of [private] persons.\"³²⁵ ³²⁰.

The concept does not define what measures a State should take during the occurrence of the injury. In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.³³⁶ This paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories.³³⁷ We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation. The types of injury listed are non-exhaustive, but represent differing levels of severity.\n## 1. Injury to Persons or Loss of Life; Physical Damage or Destruction of Objects Cyberattacks which cause physical damage equivalent to conventional attacks could constitute armed force or armed attack (when launched by a State).³³⁸ While discussions of *jus ad bellum* are beyond this paper’s scope, several observations should be made.\nFirst, category 1 represents cyberattack injury of the highest severity. Any physical harm to persons or objects would trigger a territorial State’s cyber-diligence obligation.³³⁹ But it is very rare for a cyberattack to cause category 1 damage. Predictions of cyberattacks which cause ³³⁵. Schmitt ed., *supra* note 25, rule 1 cmt para. 6, rule 5 cmt para. 5; Schmitt &amp; Watts, *supra* note 152, at 4-5.\n³³⁶.

Schmitt ed., *supra* note 25, rule 5 cmt para. 5.\nLiu chaos by shutting down air-traffic control, dams or transportation infrastructure remain hypothetical. Some argue that attacks on critical national infrastructure (such as water supply and electricity grids) would likely lead to secondary consequences of physical injury to persons and objects.³⁴⁰ An attack on one critical network has a “synergistic effect,”³⁴¹ propagating injury to other connected physical infrastructures.\nSuch conclusions need to be balanced. The scale and duration of a cyberattack and the effectiveness of the target State’s response determines the likelihood of category 1 injuries. In 2015, for the first time, a cyberattack struck an electricity grid, in Ukraine. The attackers hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) systems in seven substations,³⁴² disconnecting power to 225,000 Ukrainians for three hours. Some had anticipated an “electronic Pearl Harbour” once a cyberattack hits an electric grid.³⁴³ This did not occur. The Ukrainian energy providers shifted to manual operations and restored electricity quickly. No physical damage to infrastructure occurred.³⁴⁴ Second, as yet, only State organs are equipped and motivated to inflict material injury using cyber-offensive capabilities.³⁴⁵ Such a cyberattack would automatically be considered an act of the State.³⁴⁶ Liability turns on attribution and the breach of an international Liu obligation. Questions of whether a State failed to prevent the injury emanating from their territory become immaterial. A State may forego invoking intermediary cyber-diligence breaches if the injury is serious, preferring to treat it instead as armed force or armed attack so as to enliven jus ad bellum. Non-State hacktivists rarely (if ever) cause physical injury. Hackers instead inundate networks with DDOS attacks or implant malware and extract information.[347] Third, no reported cyberattack has yet caused injury to persons or loss of life.[348] Some have come close: hackers infiltrated a hospital network and lethally altered a patient's dosages, only to be discovered by a nurse before the drug was administered.[349] Debate exists about whether the 2010 Stuxnet virus actually caused physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.[350] Stuxnet took control of SCADA networks, manipulated data and controlled the processing speed of centrifuges. One commentator argues that the injury suffered was a mere usurpation of the SCADA networks and not injury to the physical integrity of the centrifuges.[351] Apart from Stuxnet, to date, we have been unable to identify a single cyberattack which has caused physical damage to a network's physical components and not merely destroying data or incapacitating network functions.[352] Cyberattacks overloaded and temporarily suspended networks in the Estonian and Georgian incidents.[353] But, despite social and economic disruptions, no network reportedly suffered destructive or permanent injuries. A rigid requirement of physical damage or destruction (perhaps more suited to conventional attacks) is inappropriate for cyber-diligence. The cyber-diligence obligation prevents injury to cyber networks and infrastructure. A lower level of damage should also trigger cyber-diligence. One commentator notes:\"the dependency of modern societies on [computer] networks has made it possible to incapacitate physical infrastructures without destroying them.\"# 2. Loss of Network Functionality Most cyberattack methods disrupt target networks. Cyberattacks could overwhelm a network with botnet requests, cause system malfunction, or otherwise degrade the quality of network services.[357] Herbert Lin distinguishes between a (destructive)\"cyberattack\"and a (non-destructive)\"cyber-exploitation\".[358] The former renders a network unavailable, or undermines the network's integrity, without destroying any physical components.[359] For instance, DDOS attacks on Estonian infrastructure temporarily reduced accessibility to crucial services in the financial, telecommunications, media, and government sectors.[360] The attack significantly hindered the ability to conduct financial transactions, resulting in losses to industry and Estonian citizens.[361] This paper argues that once a cyberattack causes serious disruptions to a network's proper functioning, the cyberattack is then\"destructive\", Liu and constitutes “serious injury.”³⁶² Cyber-diligence obligations should be triggered as soon as the primary injury incapacitates a network, rising to the level of “destructiveness.”³⁶³ The disruption should not simply be inconvenient, but should have a substantially detrimental effect “on the ability of the owner or operator to use the system, or communicate with other systems.”³⁶⁴ The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”) defines system interference as “the serious hindering... of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.”³⁶⁵ This definition could be applied to determine whether a cyberattack is “destructive”.³⁶⁶ A progressive interpretation of “destructive” should extend beyond damage which mirrors that of a kinetic attack. Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries.\nSecondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack.³⁶⁷ The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm.³⁶⁸ Due diligence standards change according to “new scientific or technological knowledge [and] risks involved in the activity.”³⁶⁹ Primary injury to certain infrastructures could disrupt downstream access to essential service(s) for a protracted period.³⁷⁰ If predictions of cyberattacks on health systems or transportation infrastructure materialise, the standard of cyber-diligence should rise to correspond to the increased risk. States should be obligated, with reference to the primary infrastructure affected, to take proportionate action to prevent or reduce secondary injuries (to the extent possible).³⁷¹ ## 3. Cyber-Exploitations The third category of\"injury\"results from stealthily executed cyber activities, unknown the victim.\"Cyber-exploitation\"describes an activity intended to clandestinely access and exploit a network's vulnerabilities without disturbing the network's operation.³⁷² Intelligence gathering operations most frequently cause this\"injury\".³⁷³ Hackers emplace malware into a network to collect information for economic or political purposes. Cyber-exploitations could also probe a network for vulnerabilities in preparation for future cyberattacks.³⁷⁴ The term\"injury\"is hesitantly used to refer to category (3). It is unclear what injury cyber-exploitation actually causes to a victim State.\"[An] infringement of rights or legally protected interests\"activates cyber-diligence obligations.³⁷⁵ The question turns on whether peacetime cyber-exploitation infringes a target State's territorial sovereignty.³⁷⁶ Arguably, covert cyber-exploitations which intrude on a network and extract data violate the\"honor, dignity or prestige of a State\"³⁷⁷ Liu constituting injury\"of a moral, political and legal nature.\"³⁷⁸ Some commentators argue that cyber-espionage\"can result in harm to the country at least as severe as a physical attack.\"³⁷⁹ Nonetheless, the legality of peacetime cyber-espionage is highly disputed.³⁸⁰ Data collection programs including Ghostnet, PRISM and Tempora continue,³⁸¹ implicitly tolerated by States, who\"will not want to deprive themselves of this tool.\"³⁸² There is no clear answer as to whether cyber-exploitations constitute\"serious injury\"for cyber-diligence purposes. Invoking another State's failure to prevent cyber-exploitation will likely be perceived as hypocritical.³⁸³ The Committee on Offensive Information Warfare notes that\"the distinction between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation may be very hard to draw from a technical standpoint and may lie primarily in the intent of the user.\"³⁸⁴ Indeed, a single cyberattack can cause category (2) and (3) effects. A hacktivist might plant monitoring software and or Application of Two Agreements, Concluded on 9 July 1986 between the Two States and which Related to the Problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affairs (N.Z. v. Fr.) (1990) 20 RIAA 215, 266-267 paras 107-09 (hereinafter\"Rainbow Warrior\").\na\"logic bomb\"into a system at the same time.³⁸⁵ The two infiltrations complement each other: the software assesses the network's vulnerabilities and determines a\"sweet spot\"to trigger the logic bomb, so as to cause the most injury. The (initially) non-destructive operation can mature, in real time, into a destructive cyberattack.\nSuccessful cyber-exploitation, which operates within a network, normally goes unnoticed.³⁸⁶ Cyber-diligence cannot be triggered without sufficient knowledge and should only be triggered when destructive effects materialise.\n## 4. Cyber-Vandalism, Irritation and Computer Crime The Tallinn Manual regards\"mere irritation or inconvenience\"as not of sufficient seriousness to trigger cyber-diligence.³⁸⁷ Low-intensity cyber-vandalism does not cause serious disruption to a State and is appropriately classified as a domestic cybercrime under the Budapest Convention.³⁸⁸ 85% to 97% of all cybercrimes are not revealed let alone prosecuted.³⁸⁹ Such laxity in enforcement demonstrates States' passive tolerance of low-intensity cybercrimes.³⁹⁰ To counter\"close to unlimited\"instances of cyber-vandalism,³⁹¹ States should improve domestic cybercrime regulation and dedicate cyber-diligence resources to preventing higher categories of injury.\nMarco Roscini argues that defacement alters computer data and should be characterized as a disruptive cyberattack (category 2\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\ninjury).³⁹² But it is difficult to see how defacement and propaganda goes beyond “visual corruption of public webpages”.³⁹³ Defacement may be considered offensive or even slanderous, depending on the target State’s political orientation. But unlike “destructive” cyberattacks, defacement merely causes superficial injuries to a network. Hacktivists intend to transmit unwanted political messages, not to overthrow a regime.³⁹⁴ *Oppenheim’s International Law* notes that due diligence obligations do not extend to “suppress[ing] criticism of, or propaganda directed against, other States or governments on the part of private persons.”³⁹⁵ Roscini himself recognizes that defacement is “relatively innocuous [and] psychological.”³⁹⁶ Cyber-diligence should not “imply an obligation to suppress all such conduct [inimical to] the regime or policy of a foreign State.”³⁹⁷ Despite the difficulties of retrospectively evaluating “serious injury”, this threshold reflects States’ concerns about cyberattacks which disable infrastructural operations. Under our formulation, cyber-exploitation and defacement fall below the threshold. States would likely avoid burdensome cyber-diligence for cyber activity of low-intensity, largely tolerated internationally.\nThe final section outlines hypothetical cyberattack scenarios and explores whether best-practice exchanges could set an implicit standard of cyber-diligence.",
    "# V. ASSESSING BREACH OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION": "The preceding sections define the contents and triggers of cyber-diligence obligations. This paper now discusses violation of the primary obligation.\nBreach of the primary obligation fastens on a State's knowledge, capacity to prevent, and the level of injury caused. Pierre-Marie Dupuy states: \"the true breach of an obligation of conduct is the breach of an obligation to behave (in a legally defined way).\"³⁹⁸ The accusing State needs to establish that they would not have suffered injury, or would have suffered less injury, if the accused State exercised cyber-diligence. Injury is not the decisive element. Breach is evaluated according to whether, at the origin of the injury, a State failed to do all it could to prevent the end result.³⁹⁹ As soon as a territorial State does not take all appropriate measures to stop a cyberattack, the cyber-diligence obligation has been violated.⁴⁰⁰\nThe obligation, articulated in theory, does not capture the infinite scenarios which may arise in practice, including when:⁴⁰¹\n³⁹⁸. Dupuy, supra note 69, at 379.\n³⁹⁹. Id.; Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/498, 28 [86]; cf. Crawford, supra note 201, at 310.\n⁴⁰⁰. Economides, supra note 60, at 377.\n⁴⁰¹. BECKER, supra note 202, at 151-52.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations These situations are highly abstract and all presuppose that a State has requisite knowledge and that the cyberattack causes serious injury. Variable factors across these situations determine breach. Assessment of breach ought to be “realistic and context-sensitive,”⁴⁰² particularized to the circumstances in question. Theoretically, the State in situation (1) has exercised cyber-diligence to the extent of their capabilities, satisfying the obligation. The State in situation (3) has, by contrast, failed to do all it could to stop the cyberattack, and breaches their obligation. Situation (2) is less clear: international law does not dictate States’ domestic resource-allocation.⁴⁰³ In reality, establishing responsibility is not straightforward. To evade responsibility, an accused State could claim: The accusing State then bears the unenviable burden of establishing breach.\nPredicting a breach of cyber-diligence with confidence is difficult. First, there is no minimum standard of cyber-diligence to measure compliance against.⁴⁰⁵ Second, a State’s acquiescence to a cyberattack is also likely to be covert and publicly denied.⁴⁰⁶ Third, cyber-diligence is a “moveable target”, constantly evolving as cyberspace technology develops.⁴⁰⁷ Liu The 2015 G.G.E. report recommended that the U.N.\"consider initiatives for international dialogue and exchange on ICT security issues.\"⁴⁰⁸ A C.D.C. which encompasses\"U.N. agencies, the private sector, academia and civil society organisations\"⁴⁰⁹ could facilitate best-practice exchanges. S.C. Resolution 1377 invited the C.T.C. to promote counter-terrorism best-practice and prepare model laws.⁴¹⁰ A C.D.C. could do the same, and implicitly define an expected standard of care for cyber-diligence between member States.\nBest Management Practices (\"BMPs\") in counter-piracy provide a useful example of the best-practices approach to solving problems. Devised by the International Marine Organisation and the shipping industry, the BMPs increased vessels' successful resistance to piracy by 25%.⁴¹¹ Adopting these self-help recommendations (including such matters as speed, security equipment, and watchkeeping) were in the vessels' best interests. Compliance minimized insurance premiums and decreased the probability of pirate capture.⁴¹² There is no guarantee that adopting and disseminating best-practice will achieve these results for cyber-diligence. Cyber-powers or private industries must be willing to share their (actual) best-practices before any dialogue improves cyber-diligence capabilities. Private industry could monetise cyberattack prevention capabilities and offer their services to the highest bidder. There is limited transparency in cybersecurity efforts:⁴¹³ States and industry are unlikely to openly disclose the full extent of their technical capacity.⁴¹⁴ Improving cyber-diligence may not be favourable to the geopolitical agendas of some Liu States;⁴¹⁵ an unregulated cyberspace “gives [States] more room to explore new ways of projecting power.”⁴¹⁶ Despite these barriers, a number of States have submitted voluntary reports on domestic cybersecurity practices in 2015⁴¹⁷ and 2016.⁴¹⁸ We hope that cyber-defence technology matures and is shared through best-practice dialogue. It remains unclear whether best-practice compliance will become attractive to States.",
    "# VI. CONCLUSIONS Our world is increasingly digital. Cyber-infrastructure now underpins many of the essential features of a modern society. Cyberspace pervades our lives and the dangers of its ill-use are publicly recognized. Citizens reap the benefits of cyber-technology, at the same time expecting governments to shield them from transnational cyber-threats.⁴¹⁹ On interconnected threats, the U.N. Secretary General has remarked: “we must found a new security consensus, the first article of which must be that... whatever threatens one threatens all.”⁴²⁰ Indeed, cyber-technology disregards political and cultural borders and grants unlimited reach to private actors. But there is no need to panic.": "Liu Governments, in Cass Sunstein's words, should\"take careful steps to ensure that laws and policies reduce, and do not replicate, the errors to which fearful people are prone.\"⁴²¹ The same applies for international law.\nThis paper assesses cyber-diligence practically, pre-empting how States may respond to a range of cyberattack outcomes. It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an\"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\"of serious consequences from a cyberattack.⁴²² Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example.⁴²³ Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects.\"Serious attacks\"affecting network functionality are few and far between. But the Estonian and Georgian incidents demonstrate that they can occur.\nAt a minimum, to establish breaches of cyber-diligence, the victim ⁴²¹. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 226.\n⁴²². Id. at 39; SUNSTEIN, supra note 80, at 120.\n⁴²³. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 45.\nLiu State must produce clear and convincing evidence: The above elements establish a cyber-diligence framework. It is hoped that the framework matches States' concerns in practice and can guide their cybersecurity policies. Beijing and Washington, from our opening example, should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation in relation to defacement of each other's websites. Even if constructive knowledge can be established, the hacktivism did not cause injury of the requisite threshold to trigger the obligation.\nCyber-diligence will continue to be debated within academia before States employ relevant measures. It is hoped that this paper contributes a balanced response to the present scholarship.\nIV Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 191-260 (April 2017)",

Live trackers record over 6 million cyberattacks daily. Information technology-dependent societies increasingly perceive cyber-threats as a destabilising force and citizens inevitably look to the State for protection. This paper concerns one form of State protection: whether States owe due diligence obligations in cyberspace under the laws of State responsibility. Specifically, it re-examines the contents of such an obligation and the circumstances which could trigger it in light of cyberattacks' peculiarities. A straightforward replication of due diligence models from international environmental law or law of the sea is not appropriate. But cyber-diligence should incorporate certain principles found within both models and channel ultimate responsibility for securing cyber-infrastructure onto private industry. Counter-terrorism obligations are the most useful body of law in which to seek an analogy. This paper argues that a State's cyber-diligence obligation is triggered, at a minimum, by: (1) constructive knowledge of a cyberattack, (2) which causes serious injury to an operating network. These contents and triggers define a cyber-diligence framework. Public pressure on the State and the market to intensify responses to transnational cyber-threats will drive the adoption of such principles.\nKeywords: Information Technology Law, Non-State Actors, Cyber War, National Security, Internet Governance.\nThis paper was initially written in partial fulfilment of my LLB at Monash University.

CASE STUDY: “PATRIOTIC” HACKTIVISTS\nIn April 2001, a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet collide over the South China Sea. The Chinese F-8 crashes, killing its pilot. Meanwhile, the U.S. plane makes an emergency landing on Hainan Island. China detains twenty-four U.S. crew members for eleven days in a military base.\nA Sino-U.S. “cyber-war” commences. U.S. hackers retaliate against the crew’s detention, defacing Chinese websites with messages including: “first you China men try and take our plane and crew . . . what is next? Our home land? Our freedom?” In response, “patriotic” Chinese hacktivists strike back. In a self-branded “cyber-operation defending our country,” hacktivists deface U.S. “.gov” and “.com” websites, leaving messages, including: “long live Chinese nationality!” Notably, the hacktivists on both sides were private actors, who rationalized their actions as legitimate patriotic demonstrations. This fact has led some to speculate that the Chinese government’s information warfare strategy includes “sponsoring” Chinese hacktivists. The terminology\n1.

But attribution is only one possible test of State responsibility.\nWhat is a State's responsibility for its own actions or inaction during these cyberattacks? A due diligence obligation in cyberspace (\"cyber-diligence\"), if established, would offer victim States alternative legal recourse for a territorial State's breach of a primary obligation. Subject to the contents and triggers of the obligation defined below, China and the U.S. could invoke one another's responsibility for failing to prevent hacktivism within their territories. The failure could constitute an internationally wrongful act, which would then enable either State to seek reparations.\nThe present paper uses hacktivism as its opening case study to canvass the issue of State responsibility in cyberattacks. We now turn to examine, starting from first principles, the merits of including a cyber-diligence obligation as part of the State responsibility framework.\n10.

Introduction\nCyberspace has “developed from [networks] of academic researchers into a mainstream communications mechanism.” Unfortunately, enhanced information flow results in the medium’s misuse. States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction.\nMany States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure. Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements. “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence” all work against custom crystallizing. Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity\n16.

Obliging each State to take all available measures to stop cyberattacks which emanate from their territories would improve the security of interconnected networks globally.\nArguably, to date, no cyberattack has risen to the level of a use of force. Aggrieved States have not invoked State responsibility for a failure to prevent injurious cyberattacks. Yet, live trackers record over six million cyberattacks daily, and fear of cyber insecurity has gripped the world. States increasingly invest in cyber capabilities to protect against escalations in cyberattack severity, with cyberspace militarisation widely forecasted. Some commentators opine that cyber weapons are the next “weapon of choice” for terrorism. This kind of event could propel a global uptake and strict application of cyber-diligence.

It aims to comprehensively define the contents and triggers of a cyber-diligence obligation, and offer reasoned conclusions which States could implement in practice. The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void.\nThe present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to \"peacetime\" cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack. These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers. Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State.\nFirst, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty. Cyber-diligence should be classified as an obligation of conduct. As the International Court of Justice (\"I.C.J.\") states: \"the obligation of States [is] to [employ] all means reasonably available to them\" to prevent injurious activity. But a State does not\n27. Thomas M. Franck, What Happens Now? The United Nations after Iraq, 97 AM. J. INT.

However, States should implement the polluter pays principle. Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts.\nThird, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network.\nFourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation. An objective standard of due diligence, defined through best-practice exchanges, could provide a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of States’ compliance.

States also have different capabilities to intervene in cyberspace. As a result, their capacity should limit their responsibility.\nCyberattacks transcend exclusive territorial control. But the threat does not necessitate a reinvention of international law. The proposed cyber-diligence framework preserves State-centric responsibility in cyberspace, extending post-Westphalian sovereignty to a relatively Hobbesian environment (which is barely 20 years old).

THE PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF DUE DILIGENCE IN STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## A. Due Diligence derives from Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nDue diligence is a corollary of States’ equal sovereignty. States enjoy plenary jurisdiction to control objects and subjects within their territory, but must also “respect . . . the territorial sovereignty and political integrity” of others. Flowing from States’ reciprocal respect, the I.C.J. famously articulated the due diligence obligation: “it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” Due diligence, accordingly, has developed into a general principle of international law.\n40.

Arb. 1941).\n\nCyber-diligence applies the due diligence obligation to cyberspace specifically. States should exercise cyber-diligence over cyber activity within their “legal or regulatory control.” It is the concept of territorial sovereignty which underpins all due diligence obligations. But what is “territory” in cyberspace, when the realm has no physical boundaries?\nReferences to cyberspace in this paper adopt a dualistic character: the virtual domain which facilitates internet communications and the physical hardware sustaining the domain’s operation. Cyberspace, as an intangible medium, can only exist inside tangible infrastructure. It operates via “networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures” located within a State’s territory.\nWithin their territory, States enjoy exclusive legal authority over: (1) cyber-infrastructure; (2) cyber-activity associated with their cyberinfrastructure, and; (3) persons engaged in cyber activity. States should also bear a primary due diligence obligation to ensure that their infrastructure is not used to harm the equal sovereignty of other States. A State’s failure to exercise due diligence should constitute an internationally wrongful act.\n46. Memorandum from the U.S. Dep’t. of Defense, supra note 12.\n47.

But States ought to be informed of what positive actions fulfil the obligation (Section III) and when these actions should be undertaken (Section IV). First, this paper explores a characteristic of due diligence obligations: strong in adaptability but weak in enforcement.\n# III. CONTENTS OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\n## A. Obligation of Conduct versus Obligation of Result58\nDue diligence is a \"relative, not absolute,\"59 obligation of conduct. States have the discretion to adopt any feasible measures to prevent cyberattacks injuring other States,60 \"without warranting that the [attacks] will not occur.\"61 Breach of the obligation turns on whether a territorial State took all appropriate measures to protect the victim\nTY: THE GENERAL PART 227 (2013).\n56.

Whether the territorial State had “genuine capacity to avert the threat” in the circumstances informs the assessment.\nDue diligence obligations differ from obligations of result, which require that a State must prevent the occurrence of a cyberattack, regardless of the means employed. These obligations represent a State’s absolute guarantee to reach a precise outcome. Imposing an obligation of result in cyber-diligence would likely require States to adopt burdensome practices. Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.\n## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty\nObligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States. The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States. In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence . . . into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”\n.

INT’L L. 371, 375 (1999).\n\nHowever, an obligation of conduct's elasticity has deficiencies. First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks. Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation. Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.” As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises. The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”\nCyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”, establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained . . . the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”\nThis paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature. But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework.\n.

Cyber-Diligence should not adopt the Preventive Principle\nWe begin our examination with the preventive principle, a significant element within established due diligence models. The principle requires States to take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of transboundary damage where the risk is known.78 Preventive cyber-diligence would oblige States to create and maintain a clean infrastructural environment, in advance of any cyberattacks.79 We will not address the precautionary principle, which applies in the absence of scientific certainty that a risk will cause harm.80 It is settled that cyberattacks could cause serious injury.81\nSome commentators82—and a U.N. Working Group83—posit that States should undertake preventive cyber-diligence.84 The suggestions include:85\n78.

Consultations on preventive measures with \"interested\" States;\n3. International cybersecurity cooperation, and;\n4. Monitoring suspicious activity.\nA number of these procedural steps constitute custom in international environmental law.[87] While these measures could obviate transboundary harm, they would do little to suppress ongoing or imminent cyberattacks. For instance, risk assessment identifies vulnerable networks. States could secure these networks, improve long-term network health, and make future cyberattacks harder to execute.[88] But risk assessment would do little to reduce injuries from a cyberattack that is underway. Hacktivists can launch attacks from infrastructure in States with lower cybersecurity,[89] diverting the source but not the effect of the eventual injury.[90] Another preventive measure could be to destroy malicious software (\"malware\") capable of being \"weaponized\" in a cyberattack. But nearly 200,000 new malware codes are identified daily.[91] The negligible effects of \"search and destroy\" operations do not warrant State expenditure.[92]\nPreventive measures are of minimal use when cyberattacks penetrate computer networks and cause instant injury. The territorial State should assist instead in the \"rescue effort\". They should engage skilled experts\nINCIDENTS: LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 60-61 (2010).\n86. See infra, III.B.3.\n87.

We shall demonstrate that a State's preventive duties should be confined to the circumstances in which it arose, transboundary environmental harm.\n## C. International Environmental Law\nThis subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence.\nScholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of \"noxious activity\" and prevention of \"information pollution.\" The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the \"no harm\" principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas). States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State. In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed: \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory . . . to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another . . .\n.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of \"natural resources ... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the \"neighbouring State\" concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103\nWe dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State. A cyberattack can be directed from any distant location connected to the internet and traverse\n98. Trail Smelter (U.S. v. Can.), 3 R.I.A.A. 1905, 1950 (Mixed Claims Comm'n 1938, 1941).\n99.

Id.\n\nnumerous States before it harms a network.\nSecond, the I.C.J.'s jurisprudential promotion of the preventive principle aims to secure the environment's long term sustainability and avoid disturbance to its ecological balance. Environmental damage cannot easily be undone. The harm's irreversibility underpins societies' willingness to adopt aggressive steps to control the perceived risk. This rationale is not transferable to cyberspace. Cyberspace, still in its infancy, has seemingly infinite resources. Permanent cyberspace degradation is not an issue: servers can be restored after attacks and security breaches can be repaired. At worst, physical infrastructure and data destroyed in a cyberattack still would not affect the overall functioning of the cyberspace domain.\nStates have no impetus to restrict private actors from \"polluting\" cyberspace. The \"tragedy of the commons\" theory reasons that \"we are locked into a system of fouling our own nest\". This is because the cost of the waste \"[a person] discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying [her] wastes.\" We do not foul the cyberspace \"nest\" because no amount of \"cyberwaste\" can (currently) overload and inhibit cyberspace functions. The medium fosters independent gain without fear of endangering the cyberspace platform.\nThe \"polluter pays\" principle should be applied to shift the duty of prevention onto private industry. (This should sit alongside States criminalising cyber-offences for individual liability.) As Alan Boyle suggests, \"it may be simpler, quicker, and economically more efficient to make polluters . . . pay rather than States.\" State regulations should\n.

States' cyber-diligence obligations should include implementing domestic criminal and civil liability.$^{115}$ This would harmonize the interests of territorial States (to avoid full liability) and victim States (to access legal redress at the domestic and international levels).$^{116}$\nFirst, States should identify the cyber-polluter(s) to which liability attaches.$^{117}$ In environmental law, liability attaches to the operator causing pollution, but also \"on other people specifically identified as being at the origin of the damage.\"$^{118}$ Civilly liable persons include, for example, the carrier of dangerous goods contaminating the environment,$^{119}$ and the owner of a ship from which polluting oil escaped.$^{120}$\n113.

International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 9 I.L.M.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nIn cyberspace, the polluter's \"payment\" should expand beyond monetary compensation (damages or taxes) to individual civil and criminal liability. The \"cyber-polluter\" should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable.\nSecond, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to \"threat intelligence\" companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence, \"cyber-pollution\" should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126]\nDirecting a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for \"cyber-pollution\" incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability. Consumer perception of network owners' cyber vulnerability could result in reputational and stock-price hits. The\n45, entered into force May 30, 1996.\n121.

State regulation should reinforce economic deterrence: “unclean” network owners should not receive government tenders and private contracts.\nBut emphasising private law reparations would have downsides. First, a private liability regime could dilute State responsibility, moving questions of cyber-diligence from public international law into private international law. The principle risks “exonerating certain subjects of international law from their share of responsibility for damage” caused by cyberattacks.\nSecond, civil liability does “not always [guarantee] real compensation for the damage caused to the environment.” A compensation scheme does not rectify the damage already caused to networks. To counter this inadequacy, States ought to take positive steps to terminate cyberattacks that are in progress and mitigate injury as far as possible. They should also bear cooperation duties to help restore injured networks post-cyberattack.\nIn limited State practice, victim States readily initiate prosecution under domestic criminal laws after they ascertain a hacker’s identity. In 2007, cyberattacks targeted Estonia’s government websites, e-services, and information infrastructure after Estonia removed a Soviet-era memorial. Attack methods included denial of service (“DOS”),\n. Tyler Moore, *Introducing the Economics of Cybersecurity: Principles and Policy Options, in NAT'L RES.

After the onslaught, Estonia sought to subject alleged hackers to computer sabotage crimes in their Penal Code. The U.S. has also prosecuted five Chinese hackers under their criminal code, despite the hackers being identified as members of the Chinese military, and by extension, carrying out official State organ functions.\nBut successful investigation and prosecution requires “dual criminality” of the cyberattack offence in both the victim State and the perpetrator’s domicile State. If the domicile State has not criminalized cyberattacks, they are unlikely to extradite their national for prosecution. Gathering sufficient evidence to prosecute would also be difficult: the victim State needs to access information held by the domicile State. For example, Russia refused to assist Estonia to identify hackers with Russian IP addresses. This occurred despite their bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.\nThis subsection demonstrates that the preventive principle should not be adopted in States’ cyber-diligence. Rather, despite its shortcomings, States should use the polluter pays principle to pressure industry to improve cybersecurity. States should implement the principle into domestic law as part of their cyber-diligence obligation.\nHaving established that the due diligence obligation in\n135.

As is taken up later, cyberspace, unlike the high seas, is not a res communis. An analogy with the marine environment also impractically extends the scope of cyber-diligence obligations to nationals outside territorial control. But it provides guidance for an adequate regulatory framework in cyber-diligence.\n## D. International Law of the Sea\nPart XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"UNCLOS\") enshrines States' due diligence obligations within the marine environment. Article 192 establishes the general obligation to \"protect and preserve the marine environment.\" Under Article 193, States enjoy the sovereign right to exploit natural resources, but must also take measures to prevent pollution to the marine environment.\nSeveral differences arise when applying due diligence obligations in the marine environment compared to cyberspace. First, due diligence obligations under UNCLOS do not exclusively attach to sovereignty. Vessels may operate in areas where States enjoy mutual rights. Articles 192 and 193 oblige flag States to ensure conservation of living resources, including in the exclusive economic zones of other States. To discharge this obligation, flag States ought to ensure vessels within their jurisdiction and control \"do not undermine [their] obligations . . . to protect and preserve the marine environment.\" The arbitral\n.

China knowingly tolerated “the propeller chopping method” exploiting living reefs across the Spratlys within their jurisdiction and control. China knew that their flagged vessels poached endangered species outside of their territorial control, which “[inflicted] significant damage on rare or fragile ecosystems.”\nAttaching due diligence obligations to the conduct of nationals would simply not work in the same way in cyberspace. A State’s cyber-diligence obligation should not extend to terminating a cyberattack initiated by a national abroad. In the sea, a flag vessel’s physical location is identifiable. A State’s due diligence obligation follows their flag vessels’ chartered territory. In cyberspace, a State exercises authority over infrastructure within their exclusive control both in their territory and extraterritorially. But a State’s jurisdictional control of their nationals assumes different characteristics. The operations of transnational non-State actors (and their data trails) are often borderless, simultaneously residing in multiple jurisdictions.\n.

Id. rule 2 cmt para. 3.\n\nConsider the diagram: a national of State A, physically located in State B, usurps networks in States C and D to launch attacks. For State A to terminate the cyberattacks, it needs to access networks in States C and D (constituting prohibited interference, $^{155}$  unless States C and D grant consent). In this situation, besides a duty of cooperation to assist a victim State's investigations of their national, State A should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation to terminate the cyberattack.\nSeparately, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea's (\"ITLOS\") Seabed Disputes Advisory Opinion articulates internal laws and regulations which States ought to adopt to fulfil due diligence obligations.[156] UNCLOS places due diligence obligations on States who engage contractors for projects within international waters (sponsoring States).[157] Sponsoring States are required to \"[adopt] laws\n155.

These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases.  |\n|  (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity.  |\nLiu\nThese measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State, and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity.\nCyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured.\nInternational cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked.\n## E. An Assessment of International Cooperation in Cyberspace\nCurrently, two trends in cybersecurity cooperation can be observed:\n1. States engage in multilateral cooperation efforts within regional or political alliances.\n2.

As most networks are privately owned or managed, States coordinate use of the acquired expertise in situation (2).\nCybersecurity cooperation boosts cybersecurity in the long term, but does not enforce cooperative duties during and after particular cyberattacks. Political expediency presents an obstacle to cyberattack cooperation. For example, a bilateral agreement between Russia and Estonia enshrined “obligations” to transfer evidence, assist in investigations, and extradite alleged perpetrators of criminal offences. In spite of this, Russia refused to assist Estonia’s investigations after the 2007 cyberattacks. Russia’s interpretation of the treaty excluded surveillance measures identifying a perpetrator’s physical location. A restrictive interpretation conceals, perhaps, a lack of cooperative will. Some States possibly favour a poorly regulated cyberspace.

Conversely, States may not seek or provide assistance for fear of exposing their cyber vulnerabilities or cyber-technology.[173]\nCooperative duties nonetheless need to be \"clear, useful, and doable.\"[174] To complement current regimes, they ought to immediately contain a cyberattack. States should commission cybersecurity experts,[175] and:\n1. deploy their experts to secure critical (and vulnerable) networks domestically, reducing the risk of cyberattacks emanating from their territory; and\n2. in the event of an ongoing cyberattack, mobilize these experts in real-time to instantly upgrade network security.\nExperts could be exchanged between contracting agencies within cooperating States.[176] Each State could mobilize experts from multiple jurisdictions if cyberattacks occurred or if their private sector demanded increased protection. States with cyber-monitoring capabilities may warn others, in advance, of increased malicious traffic indicating imminent cyberattack(s).[177] A target State can then boost network capacity in anticipation. In ongoing cyberattacks, assisting States may host servers, transfer bandwidth, and eliminate botnet traffic.\nBut these suggestions remain aspirational. First, duties to co-operate are obligations of conduct \"formulated in a relatively weak way,\"[178] which do not drive outcomes.

A unilateral referral of the dispute to judicial settlement or arbitration was ineffective. Indeed, as the Estonia-Russia Treaty illustrates, States exercise discretion in their adherence to a cooperation treaty.\nSecond, some commentators stress that States bear a legal obligation to cooperate in reducing cyber threats, as cyberspace integrity is relevant to international security.

Cyberspace is not a natural, indivisible asset. Each State is encouraged to invest in cyberspace to reap economic, political, and social benefits.\nStates currently have no incentive to agree on a common regulatory regime in cyberspace. Doing so would decrease their margin of appreciation to set cyberspace priorities. Any common interests in cyberspace fasten on ensuring the platform's development, so that each State can advance their private interest. States increasingly “[establish sovereign control] in the virtual world in the name of security and economic sustainability.”\nThird, cooperative efforts will likely be limited to agreements between politically aligned States.

Prevention of Transnational Terrorism\n## 1. Introduction\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks share parallels. The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed. We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\" A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats. These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law. They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory. Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear . . . to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.” A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.\n## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison\nInternational law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network” without a formal hierarchy. Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”. Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.\nAnonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.” The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream,\n208. *Id.* at 114.\n209.

Its \"ops\" begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to \"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling \"anons\" into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites. In 2012, \"anons\" initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline. \"Operation Anti-ACTA\" responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation. Anonymous proclaimed that the agreement \"[enslaves] the internet.\" While the government website was down, Polish politicians opposed to the agreement wore Guy Fawkes masks (the symbol of the Anonymous movement) in Parliament.\nPrivate actors domiciled across different States accomplish Al-Qaeda and Anonymous' \"successes\". They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.\n215. D.C.

The obligation existed within custom and conventions well before 9/11. However, this paper focuses on the counter-terrorism standard of due diligence established within Resolution 1373.\nIn handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.” States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.” The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.\nResolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations. States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation). These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security, which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.\n.

SAUL, supra note 202, at 21; Bardo Fassbender, The U.N. Security Council and\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nResolution 1373 established the Counter-Terrorism Committee (\"C.T.C.\") and required \"all States to report to the Committee . . . on the steps they have taken to implement this resolution.\"\nThe C.T.C. initiated a transnational \"capacity building blitz\". The S.C. should similarly establish a Cyber-Diligence Committee (\"C.D.C.\"). First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks.\n## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision\nResolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures. The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies, and does not enforce sanctions on those who \"fail\" to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment.\nThe U.N. General Assembly has established the Group of Governmental Experts in Information Security (\"G.G.E.\"), signalling an intention to centralise cybersecurity efforts. The Group outlines\nInternational Terrorism, in Bianchi &amp; Naqvi eds, supra note 26, at 83-92; see also SUNSTEIN, supra note 85, at 123.\n228. Resolution 1373, supra note 222, para. 6.\n229.

The C.D.C's overall goal should be to assist (particularly developing) States building capacity to prevent cyberattacks. A gradual improvement in capacity throughout all 191 U.N. member States could decrease the frequency of cyberattacks, although this will take time, and requires ample financial resources.\nThe C.D.C's specific functions should resemble those of the C.T.C.: appoint experts to advise States on cyber-diligence compliance, coordinate assistance between donors and donees, and elicit compulsory written reports on States' capacity building measures. A C.D.C. reduces the discretion of States to determine appropriate measures for cyber-diligence. Through reviews, the C.D.C. should implicitly set a due diligence standard for States to meet in acquiring capacity. A C.D.C. should stress the relative nature of cyber-diligence and not stretch the obligation into one of absolute prevention. (It should centralize responsibility for co-ordinating cyber-diligence efforts, but preserve due diligence as an obligation of conduct.)\n233.

PROULX, supra note 212, at 79; BECKER, supra note 202, at 145.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nHowever, a capacity-building focus has limitations. It risks creating a disparity between States' reported capacity and their actual exercise of that capacity. Unresolved tensions include:\n1. whether the C.D.C. should impose effective enforcement mechanisms, or respect State decisions on internal social, economic, and political matters; and\n2. how the C.D.C. should determine which States: (i) do not have a genuine capacity to acquire or execute cyber-diligence (unable but willing), and; which States (ii) have the capacity (in reality) to exercise cyber-diligence, but decline to do so (able but unwilling).\nIn the counter-terrorism context, Tal Becker proposes that due diligence standards should apply to a State:\n1. acquiring the (legal, administrative, and resource) capacity to meet their due diligence obligations, and;\n2. “[employing] its capabilities with due diligence”.\nBecker’s proposed standards should be incorporated into States’ cyber-diligence obligations. The C.D.C. should supervise States’ compliance with limb (1). States who fail to notify the C.D.C. of their capacity deficits should be disentitled from pleading a lack of capacity if a subsequent cyberattack implicates their networks. This approach limits the responsibility of unable but willing States for a particular cyberattack, provided they have fulfilled limb (1) to the extent of their capacity. Other domestic exigencies may militate against\n. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128.\n. U.N. Charter art. 2(7).\n.

BECKER, supra note 209, at 146.\n\nLiu\na State's exercise of cyber-diligence capabilities. If so, a State should not be held in violation of limb (2), taking into account the particular circumstances at the time of the cyberattack.\nIf *able but unwilling* States simply ignore limb (2), establishing a failure to exercise cyber-diligence would be relatively straightforward. However, difficulties arise where *able but unwilling* States exercise cyber-diligence “half-heartedly”. For instance, a State could neutralise a third of the total botnets emanating from their territory (when they have the capacity to terminate the entire cyberattack). To establish violation, the victim State ought to prove that the territorial State did not employ their full capacity to prevent the cyberattack.\nThere is no “quick fix” to these tensions. Nonetheless, a C.D.C. should introduce an internationally calibrated strategy to capacity building in cyber-diligence. Far from being merely theoretical, 159 States have received counter-terrorism assistance as a result of the C.T.C. A C.D.C. realises the UN’s role of equipping States with the *capacity for* cyber-diligence, but not overstepping its intergovernmental character to intervene in States’ actual exercise of cyber-diligence.\nThis section argues that the contents of a State’s cyber-diligence obligation should include: (1) the “cyber-polluter pays” principle; (2) implementing regulations for industry to secure infrastructure, and; (3) capacity-building via consultation with the C.D.C. But States ought to know what circumstances enliven their obligation to fulfil these contents. The following section considers the two key triggers of cyber-diligence obligations: knowledge and injury.\n244. TRAPP, *supra* note 63, at 79.\n245.

Does Actual or Constructive Knowledge Trigger Cyber-Diligence?\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, a sovereign's responsibility for their subjects' actions consists of \"forbearance\" and \"protection shewn to transgressions.\" The sovereign must: (1) know of the transgression and; (2) fail to prevent or punish the delinquency.\nKnowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility. States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it. Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury. There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion. A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.\nThis paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:\n250.

A botnet is \"a network of compromised computers.\" \"The bots\" are remotely controlled by the \"botherder\" and conduct coordinated cyber operations. There is no limit on the number of bots that can be \"recruited\". See Schmitt ed., supra note 25, at 257; COMMITTEE ON OFFENSIVE INFORMATION WARFARE, supra note 25, at 89.\n254. But see, infra IV.3.b.\n255. Unless the state itself launched the cyberattack, a fact that is exceedingly difficult to prove.\n\n1. Actual knowledge: a State knows of a cyberattack (where a State organ conducts the cyberattack);\n2. Conniance: a State wilfully shuts their eyes to the obvious occurrence of a cyberattack (for example, after detecting the cyberattack or being notified of it);\n3. Objective evidence leads to a logical conclusion that:\n- a State ought to have known of a cyberattack, or;\n- a State had information on a cyberattack, and was obliged to undertake further inquiries, but failed to do so;\n4. In the event a C.D.C. is adopted, States bear a heightened duty of vigilance to identify and eliminate threats within their territory. Constructive knowledge and an obligation to undertake further inquiries are built into this duty.\nCategories (1) – (2) constitute subjective knowledge, while categories (3) – (4) amount to constructive (objective) knowledge. First, we demonstrate that all four categories should suffice to trigger cyber-diligence. Second, we suggest an appropriate standard of proof to establish a territorial State’s knowledge before an international court or tribunal (“international tribunal”).\n## 1. Subjective Knowledge is Difficult to Establish\n### i. Categories 1 and 2\nSubjective knowledge is the highest degree of intent. A State either intended the cyberattack to cause serious injury, or endorsed the outcome. In judicial proceedings, victim States may struggle to establish a territorial State’s actual knowledge or connivance. The accused State’s sovereignty shrouds any evidence of subjective knowledge in secrecy. It is unthinkable that an accused State would surrender documents\n.

In Tehran Hostages, the I.C.J. relied on notification to infer Iran's actual knowledge of militant raids. Iran was \"fully aware . . . of the urgent need for action,\" given \"repeated calls for help\" to the Iranian Foreign Ministry. Iran's inaction was \"due to more than mere negligence or lack of appropriate means.\"\nHowever, victim States rarely notify territorial States of a cyberattack. Notification consumes time, does little to reduce injury, and tarnishes inter-State relations. Instead, a State will likely devote their resources to withstanding a cyberattack. In the Estonian incident, botnet infiltrations implicated computers in 178 countries. Estonia did not notify one territorial State. Instead, Estonia increased bandwidth capacity (so networks could handle increased traffic), filtered malicious transmissions, and engaged U.S. and N.A.T.O. assistance to terminate sources of the attack. Some territorial States voluntarily neutralized sources of attacks.\nIn 2008, Georgia and Russia engaged in armed conflict over the South Ossetia region. Georgia suffered concurrent cyberattacks on their governmental, commercial and media networks, (supposedly) coordinated via Russian infrastructure. Georgia, a \"cyber-locked\" State, relied on neighbouring States' cyber infrastructure to facilitate\n258. Tribunals have questioned the veracity of leaked documents. Prosecutor v.

Georgia did not notify Russia of the cyberattacks, instead relocating important servers to the U.S. Google's secure servers temporarily hosted a news portal, and NATO also secured Georgian networks.\nIf only notification could enliven knowledge, then no cyber-diligence could ever be triggered in incidents like the cyberattacks on Estonia and Georgia. Victim States mitigate loss and boost defences when a cyberattack begins. Politically allied States disable attack sources and offer relief networks. Victim States do not benefit from notification.\nThe knowledge threshold to trigger cyber-diligence should be lowered. Kimberley Trapp argues (in the counter-terrorism context): \"requiring proof of subjective knowledge would effectively act as a bar to any finding of responsibility for a failure to prevent.\" A territorial State's cyber-diligence obligation should be triggered if they \"ought to have known\" of a cyberattack.\n## 2. Constructive Knowledge Should Trigger Cyber-Diligence Obligations\n### i. Category 3\nInternational jurisprudence supports constructive knowledge triggering due diligence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J's majority judgment relied on a series of inferences to conclude that the minefield laying \"could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of Albania.\" The majority inferred Albania's knowledge according to objective standards.\n.

Notably, two dissentients (Judge Azevedo and Judge Krylov) held Albania was under a continuous duty to inform itself of reasonably foreseeable threats in its territory, or, as Ian Brownlie argues, “[to] take reasonable care to discover activities of trespassers.”\nIn the Bosnian Genocide case, the I.C.J. found that a State’s obligation to prevent the occurrence of genocide is engaged “at the instant that the State learns of, or should normally have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.” Engaging the obligation to prevent genocide is tantamount to triggering cyber-diligence if the State should have reasonably known of the attack’s occurrence.\nIn Asian Agricultural Products, the Tribunal emphasized Sri Lanka bore a duty to exercise “[an] ‘objective’ standard of vigilance in assessing the required degree of protection and security . . . for foreign investors.” The language of these cases suggest that constructive knowledge should be established if the territorial State had information that a cyberattack might occur and failed to conduct further inquiries.\nElsewhere, some commentators argue constructive knowledge should be presumed when a cyberattack implicates a State’s exclusive governmental infrastructure. The aggrieved State ought to establish that the attack travelled through the territorial State’s governmental infrastructure. Constructive knowledge is prima facie established if the infrastructure was under direct State control and used only for\n275. Id.; TRAPP, supra note 63, at 69; BECKER, supra note 202, at 134.\n276.

Indications of government infrastructure's involvement in a cyberattack can be deceiving. First, non-State hackers may compromise a government server.284 A cyberattack being mounted from government infrastructure does not in itself establish responsibility in the cyber context.285\nSecond, cyberattacks are often dressed with \"spoofing\" (identify manipulation) techniques. In the Estonian incident, spoofing clouded evidence which incriminated Moscow's exclusive infrastructure: unknown perpetrators could have adopted the veil of a Moscow government computer.286 Often, \"onion routing\" techniques are used to conceal perpetrators' identity.287 The majority of cyberattacks use such masquerading tactics.288 Even if network logs suggest a cyberattack exploited government infrastructure, the victim State should still be bound to adduce evidence to dismiss spoofing concerns.\nSome commentators stretch the presumption of constructive knowledge further. They advocate a reverse presumptio juris whenever a cyberattack is associated with government infrastructure,289 or when \"injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State.\"290 International tribunals would shift the burden of proof onto the territorial State, who must disprove their presumed constructive knowledge.291\n283.

Ryan et al., supra note 289.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nReversal of the burden of proof conflicts with I.C.J. jurisprudence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J. did not infer Albania's constructive knowledge of injurious activity purely based on their exclusive territorial control. Territorial control does not “[shift] the burden of proof . . . in relation to unlawful acts perpetrated therein.” In Pulp Mills, the I.C.J. stated “a preventive approach . . . does not [operate] as a reversal of the burden of proof.” It is not for the territorial State to prove its diligence. State control over governmental networks only gives rise to “abstract and immaterial knowledge” of a cyberattack, insufficient to presume State responsibility.\nBut victim States may use the accused State's control over government infrastructure as evidence. Section IV.A.3. explains how a pattern of such evidence should establish constructive knowledge. But first, we examine how constructive knowledge would operate under category 4.\n## ii. Category 4\nWith reference to Section III.F.3., should a C.D.C. framework be established, a degree of constructive knowledge should be presumed. Territorial States would be held to a standard of vigilance in maintaining their cyber-territory, and constructive knowledge of an ongoing or imminent attack would be imputed to these States. States would have less latitude to plead a lack of capacity to discover a particular cyberattack.\nPresuming knowledge would reflect heightened expectations for State compliance with cyber-diligence obligations. The victim State still bears the burden of proof and should establish knowledge\n292.

Overcoming the Evidentiary Hurdle: Standard of Proof\nTypically, a failure in due diligence will be raised after the victim State (“applicant”) suffers injury. The issue turns to causation. How does the applicant gather sufficient evidence to establish that actual or constructive knowledge triggered the territorial State’s (“respondent”) cyber-diligence obligation? The applicant will struggle to establish their case absent the respondent’s assistance or at least consent to evidence collection.\nThe I.C.J. acknowledges that victim States face evidentiary difficulties, allowing a “more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence . . . provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.” But the standard of proof in an international tribunal should not be lowered “simply because it is . . . difficult to reach.” The standard “[protects] the respondent against false attribution . . . a particularly serious risk in the cyber context.”\nThe applicant must produce reliable and neutral evidence to establish that the respondent at least ought to have known of the cyberattack. They could rely on experts to adduce logs of the respondent’s network behaviour during the cyberattack.

The applicant may also produce documentary data and press reports to establish the respondent had sufficient information to make further inquiries into the cyberattack, but failed to do so.\nSome commentators advocate for a “very liberal approach to evidence [in cyberspace].” They contrast the anonymity of cyberattacks against kinetic threats, which are physically traceable, before, during, and after the attack.\nHowever, the primary rule invoked in a matter determines the standard of proof. International tribunals should not adopt a low standard of proof in due diligence matters. As Durward Sandifer argues: “in dealing with sovereign States . . . it cannot lightly be presumed that one of the parties to the litigation is guilty of negligence.” Doing so may result in evidence of low probative value establishing a breach of due diligence, which would undercut the presumption that States observe international law. Conversely, the standard of proof should not be so “unduly exacting” that it becomes impossible to meet.\nRep. 2014 (Mar. 31), p. 226, 237 paras 18-20, 255-57 paras 73-82, 283 paras 188-90, 290-93 paras 217-227; The South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of Philippines v.

The applicant ought to produce \"sufficiently clear\" and weighty evidence to meet the standard. The applicant could realistically gather sufficient evidence to establish a reasonable inference of the respondent's constructive knowledge. The standard also precludes international tribunals finding violations of international law based on unconvincing evidence, especially given these proceedings rarely have appeal mechanisms.\nHowever, cyberattacks may regularly implicate governmental cyber-infrastructure in particular States. This paper argues that an applicant establishes constructive knowledge to a clear and convincing standard if it adduces evidence of:\n1. a sustained pattern of association between cyberattacks causing serious injury and the respondent's governmental infrastructure; and\n2. the same infrastructure's involvement in the applicant's incident.\nGreenwood).\n313.

It also incentivizes States to secure (at least) their governmental infrastructure. But the approach does not prejudice States who lack the capacity to safeguard their governmental infrastructure.\nQuestions of a State's actual or constructive knowledge are contingent on a judicial forum's evidentiary standards. Together, they form the \"knowledge\" element to trigger cyber-diligence obligations. A threshold of constructive knowledge proven to a clear and convincing standard has been advanced. This paper now turns to the second trigger-element: injury.\n## B. What Level of Injury Engages A Cyber-Diligence Duty?\nInjury is not a pre-requisite to finding an internationally wrongful act under the laws of State responsibility. Once a breach is attributed to a State, responsibility is potentially engaged, subject to application of the primary rule. In the context of due diligence, however, damage is a condition to finding a violation of the primary rule. A State who failed to exercise cyber-diligence is only liable for breaching the primary rule after hostile acts, contrary to another State's legal rights, occur. When \"due diligence is violated, there is an attribution to the State . . . of the consequences of the acts of [private] persons.\"\n. See infra, V.\n.

Stern, supra note 33.\nLiu\nNot all cyberattacks engage a State's cyber-diligence obligation. Due diligence obligations derive from States' sovereign equality. States must exercise cyber-diligence to disable cyberattacks which detrimentally affect the legal rights of other States. Responsibility attaches when a cyberattack infracts the \"theoretical inviolability\" of a national legal order. Cyber-diligence obligations \"re-establish the status quo erat.\" With that in mind, this section defines \"serious injury\" to trigger States' cyber-diligence obligations.\nThe Tallinn Manual defines an \"unlawful [cyber] act\" as \"all cyber activities from one State's territory that affect the rights of other States [producing] a negative effect.\" The definition covers any operation affecting \"sovereignty\": a lower level of injury compared to an act of interference or armed force.\nHowever, when is \"a negative effect\" of sufficient gravity to trigger cyber-diligence? Jurisprudence and the literature establish a context-dependent standard of serious injury. In *Trail Smelter*, the arbitral tribunal stated \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury . . . when the case is of serious consequence.\" Some commentators state that \"serious injury\" triggers the duty, without further explanation. The Tallinn Manual ambiguously concludes that \"physical damage to objects or injuries to\n. See infra, III.B.\n.

The concept does not define what measures a State should take during the occurrence of the injury. In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.\nThis paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories. We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation. The types of injury listed are non-exhaustive, but represent differing levels of severity.\n## 1. Injury to Persons or Loss of Life; Physical Damage or Destruction of Objects\nCyberattacks which cause physical damage equivalent to conventional attacks could constitute armed force or armed attack (when launched by a State). While discussions of *jus ad bellum* are beyond this paper’s scope, several observations should be made.\nFirst, category 1 represents cyberattack injury of the highest severity. Any physical harm to persons or objects would trigger a territorial State’s cyber-diligence obligation. But it is very rare for a cyberattack to cause category 1 damage.

Some argue that attacks on critical national infrastructure (such as water supply and electricity grids) would likely lead to secondary consequences of physical injury to persons and objects. An attack on one critical network has a “synergistic effect,” propagating injury to other connected physical infrastructures.\nSuch conclusions need to be balanced. The scale and duration of a cyberattack and the effectiveness of the target State’s response determines the likelihood of category 1 injuries. In 2015, for the first time, a cyberattack struck an electricity grid, in Ukraine. The attackers hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) systems in seven substations, disconnecting power to 225,000 Ukrainians for three hours. Some had anticipated an “electronic Pearl Harbour” once a cyberattack hits an electric grid. This did not occur. The Ukrainian energy providers shifted to manual operations and restored electricity quickly. No physical damage to infrastructure occurred.\nSecond, as yet, only State organs are equipped and motivated to inflict material injury using cyber-offensive capabilities. Such a cyberattack would automatically be considered an act of the State. Liability turns on attribution and the breach of an international\n340.

A State may forego invoking intermediary cyber-diligence breaches if the injury is serious, preferring to treat it instead as armed force or armed attack so as to enliven jus ad bellum. Non-State hacktivists rarely (if ever) cause physical injury. Hackers instead inundate networks with DDOS attacks or implant malware and extract information.[347]\nThird, no reported cyberattack has yet caused injury to persons or loss of life.[348] Some have come close: hackers infiltrated a hospital network and lethally altered a patient's dosages, only to be discovered by a nurse before the drug was administered.[349] Debate exists about whether the 2010 Stuxnet virus actually caused physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.[350] Stuxnet took control of SCADA networks, manipulated data and controlled the processing speed of centrifuges. One commentator argues that the injury suffered was a mere usurpation of the SCADA networks and not injury to the physical integrity of the centrifuges.[351] Apart from Stuxnet, to date, we have been unable to identify a single cyberattack which has caused physical damage to a network's physical components and not merely destroying data or incapacitating network functions.[352]\nCyberattacks overloaded and temporarily suspended networks in the Estonian and Georgian incidents.[353] But, despite social and economic disruptions, no network reportedly suffered destructive or permanent\n347.

A rigid requirement of physical damage or destruction (perhaps more suited to conventional attacks) $^{354}$  is inappropriate for cyber-diligence. The cyber-diligence obligation prevents injury to cyber networks and infrastructure. A lower level of damage should also trigger cyber-diligence. One commentator notes: \"the dependency of modern societies on [computer] networks has made it possible to incapacitate physical infrastructures without destroying them.\" $^{355}$\n# 2. Loss of Network Functionality $^{356}$\nMost cyberattack methods disrupt target networks. Cyberattacks could overwhelm a network with botnet requests, cause system malfunction, or otherwise degrade the quality of network services.[357] Herbert Lin distinguishes between a (destructive) \"cyberattack\" and a (non-destructive) \"cyber-exploitation\".[358] The former renders a network unavailable, or undermines the network's integrity, without destroying any physical components.[359] For instance, DDOS attacks on Estonian infrastructure temporarily reduced accessibility to crucial services in the financial, telecommunications, media, and government sectors.[360] The attack significantly hindered the ability to conduct financial transactions, resulting in losses to industry and Estonian citizens.[361]\nThis paper argues that once a cyberattack causes serious disruptions to a network's proper functioning, the cyberattack is then \"destructive\",\n354.

Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries.\nSecondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack. The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm.

If predictions of cyberattacks on health systems or transportation infrastructure materialise, the standard of cyber-diligence should rise to correspond to the increased risk. States should be obligated, with reference to the primary infrastructure affected, to take proportionate action to prevent or reduce secondary injuries (to the extent possible).\n## 3. Cyber-Exploitations\nThe third category of \"injury\" results from stealthily executed cyber activities, unknown the victim. \"Cyber-exploitation\" describes an activity intended to clandestinely access and exploit a network's vulnerabilities without disturbing the network's operation. Intelligence gathering operations most frequently cause this \"injury\". Hackers emplace malware into a network to collect information for economic or political purposes. Cyber-exploitations could also probe a network for vulnerabilities in preparation for future cyberattacks.\nThe term \"injury\" is hesitantly used to refer to category (3). It is unclear what injury cyber-exploitation actually causes to a victim State. \"[An] infringement of rights or legally protected interests\" activates cyber-diligence obligations. The question turns on whether peacetime cyber-exploitation infringes a target State's territorial sovereignty.\nArguably, covert cyber-exploitations which intrude on a network and extract data violate the \"honor, dignity or prestige of a State\"\n370.

Data collection programs including Ghostnet, PRISM and Tempora continue, implicitly tolerated by States, who \"will not want to deprive themselves of this tool.\" There is no clear answer as to whether cyber-exploitations constitute \"serious injury\" for cyber-diligence purposes. Invoking another State's failure to prevent cyber-exploitation will likely be perceived as hypocritical.\nThe Committee on Offensive Information Warfare notes that \"the distinction between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation may be very hard to draw from a technical standpoint and may lie primarily in the intent of the user.\" Indeed, a single cyberattack can cause category (2) and (3) effects.

The two infiltrations complement each other: the software assesses the network's vulnerabilities and determines a \"sweet spot\" to trigger the logic bomb, so as to cause the most injury. The (initially) non-destructive operation can mature, in real time, into a destructive cyberattack.\nSuccessful cyber-exploitation, which operates within a network, normally goes unnoticed. Cyber-diligence cannot be triggered without sufficient knowledge and should only be triggered when destructive effects materialise.\n## 4. Cyber-Vandalism, Irritation and Computer Crime\nThe Tallinn Manual regards \"mere irritation or inconvenience\" as not of sufficient seriousness to trigger cyber-diligence. Low-intensity cyber-vandalism does not cause serious disruption to a State and is appropriately classified as a domestic cybercrime under the Budapest Convention. 85% to 97% of all cybercrimes are not revealed let alone prosecuted. Such laxity in enforcement demonstrates States' passive tolerance of low-intensity cybercrimes. To counter \"close to unlimited\" instances of cyber-vandalism, States should improve domestic cybercrime regulation and dedicate cyber-diligence resources to preventing higher categories of injury.\nMarco Roscini argues that defacement alters computer data and should be characterized as a disruptive cyberattack (category 2\n385. Goodman, supra note 363; Kamal, supra note 343, at 40-41. A tactic known as the \"malware time-bomb\" was used in the Georgia incident, where hacktivists planted \"time-bombs\" to cause further damage upon the occurrence of a trigger event.\n386.

But it is difficult to see how defacement and propaganda goes beyond “visual corruption of public webpages”. Defacement may be considered offensive or even slanderous, depending on the target State’s political orientation. But unlike “destructive” cyberattacks, defacement merely causes superficial injuries to a network. Hacktivists intend to transmit unwanted political messages, not to overthrow a regime. *Oppenheim’s International Law* notes that due diligence obligations do not extend to “suppress[ing] criticism of, or propaganda directed against, other States or governments on the part of private persons.” Roscini himself recognizes that defacement is “relatively innocuous [and] psychological.” Cyber-diligence should not “imply an obligation to suppress all such conduct [inimical to] the regime or policy of a foreign State.”\nDespite the difficulties of retrospectively evaluating “serious injury”, this threshold reflects States’ concerns about cyberattacks which disable infrastructural operations. Under our formulation, cyber-exploitation and defacement fall below the threshold. States would likely avoid burdensome cyber-diligence for cyber activity of low-intensity, largely tolerated internationally.\nThe final section outlines hypothetical cyberattack scenarios and explores whether best-practice exchanges could set an implicit standard of cyber-diligence.\n392.

ASSESSING BREACH OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\nThe preceding sections define the contents and triggers of cyber-diligence obligations. This paper now discusses violation of the primary obligation.\nBreach of the primary obligation fastens on a State's knowledge, capacity to prevent, and the level of injury caused. Pierre-Marie Dupuy states: \"the true breach of an obligation of conduct is the breach of an obligation to behave (in a legally defined way).\" The accusing State needs to establish that they would not have suffered injury, or would have suffered less injury, if the accused State exercised cyber-diligence. Injury is not the decisive element. Breach is evaluated according to whether, at the origin of the injury, a State failed to do all it could to prevent the end result. As soon as a territorial State does not take all appropriate measures to stop a cyberattack, the cyber-diligence obligation has been violated.\nThe obligation, articulated in theory, does not capture the infinite scenarios which may arise in practice, including when:\n1. A lesser-able State puts their limited capacity to diligent use, doing all they can to stop a cyberattack.\n2. A State has sound cyber-capabilities in general, but is \"resource-poor\" at the time of the cyberattack. The State may have allocated intense resources to other priorities and is unable to terminate the cyberattack.\n3. A State with sound cyber-capabilities, both generally and at the time of a cyberattack, decides not to terminate the cyberattack.\n. Dupuy, supra note 69, at 379.\n.

BECKER, supra note 202, at 151-52.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nThese situations are highly abstract and all presuppose that a State has requisite knowledge and that the cyberattack causes serious injury. Variable factors across these situations determine breach. Assessment of breach ought to be “realistic and context-sensitive,” particularized to the circumstances in question. Theoretically, the State in situation (1) has exercised cyber-diligence to the extent of their capabilities, satisfying the obligation. The State in situation (3) has, by contrast, failed to do all it could to stop the cyberattack, and breaches their obligation. Situation (2) is less clear: international law does not dictate States’ domestic resource-allocation.\nIn reality, establishing responsibility is not straightforward. To evade responsibility, an accused State could claim:\n1. they exercised their best efforts, yet still failed to achieve a result in the face of new cyberattack methods;\n2. a lack of capacity at the time of a cyberattack, given other exigencies; or\n3. they lacked sufficient knowledge of the cyberattacks.\nThe accusing State then bears the unenviable burden of establishing breach.\nPredicting a breach of cyber-diligence with confidence is difficult. First, there is no minimum standard of cyber-diligence to measure compliance against. Second, a State’s acquiescence to a cyberattack is also likely to be covert and publicly denied. Third, cyber-diligence is a “moveable target”, constantly evolving as cyberspace technology develops.\n402.

Seabed Mining, Advisory Opinion, supra note 70, para. 117.\nLiu\nThe 2015 G.G.E. report recommended that the U.N. \"consider initiatives for international dialogue and exchange on ICT security issues.\" A C.D.C. which encompasses \"U.N. agencies, the private sector, academia and civil society organisations\" could facilitate best-practice exchanges. S.C. Resolution 1377 invited the C.T.C. to promote counter-terrorism best-practice and prepare model laws. A C.D.C. could do the same, and implicitly define an expected standard of care for cyber-diligence between member States.\nBest Management Practices (\"BMPs\") in counter-piracy provide a useful example of the best-practices approach to solving problems. Devised by the International Marine Organisation and the shipping industry, the BMPs increased vessels' successful resistance to piracy by 25%. Adopting these self-help recommendations (including such matters as speed, security equipment, and watchkeeping) were in the vessels' best interests. Compliance minimized insurance premiums and decreased the probability of pirate capture.\nThere is no guarantee that adopting and disseminating best-practice will achieve these results for cyber-diligence. Cyber-powers or private industries must be willing to share their (actual) best-practices before any dialogue improves cyber-diligence capabilities. Private industry could monetise cyberattack prevention capabilities and offer their services to the highest bidder. There is limited transparency in cybersecurity efforts: States and industry are unlikely to openly disclose the full extent of their technical capacity. Improving cyber-diligence may not be favourable to the geopolitical agendas of some\n408. Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications, U.N. Doc.

We hope that cyber-defence technology matures and is shared through best-practice dialogue. It remains unclear whether best-practice compliance will become attractive to States.\n# VI. CONCLUSIONS\nOur world is increasingly digital. Cyber-infrastructure now underpins many of the essential features of a modern society. Cyberspace pervades our lives and the dangers of its ill-use are publicly recognized. Citizens reap the benefits of cyber-technology, at the same time expecting governments to shield them from transnational cyber-threats.\nOn interconnected threats, the U.N. Secretary General has remarked: “we must found a new security consensus, the first article of which must be that . . . whatever threatens one threatens all.” Indeed, cyber-technology disregards political and cultural borders and grants unlimited reach to private actors. But there is no need to panic.\n415. Jason Fritz, *How China will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness*, 8 CULT. MANDALA 28 (2008).\n416. Czosseck, *supra* note 9, at 16.\n417.

Report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, In Larger Freedom: Towards Development, Security and Human Rights for All, U.N. Doc. A/59/2005 (2005), p. 25 para. 81.\nLiu\nGovernments, in Cass Sunstein's words, should \"take careful steps to ensure that laws and policies reduce, and do not replicate, the errors to which fearful people are prone.\" The same applies for international law.\nThis paper assesses cyber-diligence practically, pre-empting how States may respond to a range of cyberattack outcomes. It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an \"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\" of serious consequences from a cyberattack. Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example. Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects. \"Serious attacks\" affecting network functionality are few and far between. But the Estonian and Georgian incidents demonstrate that they can occur.\nAt a minimum, to establish breaches of cyber-diligence, the victim\n. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 226.\n. Id. at 39; SUNSTEIN, supra note 80, at 120.\n. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 45.\nLiu\nState must produce clear and convincing evidence:\n1. of the territorial State's constructive knowledge, and;\n2. that the cyberattack caused category (1) (physical destruction) or category 2 (incapacitation) injury to objects or subjects within their territory.\nThe above elements establish a cyber-diligence framework. It is hoped that the framework matches States' concerns in practice and can guide their cybersecurity policies. Beijing and Washington, from our opening example, should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation in relation to defacement of each other's websites. Even if constructive knowledge can be established, the hacktivism did not cause injury of the requisite threshold to trigger the obligation.\nCyber-diligence will continue to be debated within academia before States employ relevant measures. It is hoped that this paper contributes a balanced response to the present scholarship.\nIV Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 191-260 (April 2017)\n\n# Footnotes from table in section III.D.\n1.

States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction. Many States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure.¹⁷ Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements.¹⁸ “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence”¹⁹ all work against custom crystallizing.²⁰ Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity",

The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void. The present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to \"peacetime\" cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack.²⁸ These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers.²⁹ Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State. First, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty.

Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks. Cyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts. Third, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network. Fourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation. An objective standard of due diligence, defined through best-practice exchanges, could provide a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of States’ compliance.³³ But many States may not be ³¹ Id.; James Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N.

Liu State from attack.⁶² Whether the territorial State had “genuine capacity to avert the threat” in the circumstances informs the assessment.⁶³ Due diligence obligations differ from obligations of result, which require that a State must prevent the occurrence of a cyberattack, regardless of the means employed.⁶⁴ These obligations represent a State’s absolute guarantee to reach a precise outcome.⁶⁵ Imposing an obligation of result in cyber-diligence would likely require States to adopt burdensome practices. Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.⁶⁶ ## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty Obligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States.⁶⁷ The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States.⁶⁸ In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence . . . into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”⁶⁹ ⁶².

INT’L L. 371, 375 (1999). 202 Liu However, an obligation of conduct's elasticity has deficiencies. First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks.⁷⁰ Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation.⁷¹ Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.”⁷² As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises.⁷³ The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”⁷⁴ Cyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”,⁷⁵ establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained . . . the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”⁷⁶ This paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature.⁷⁷ But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework. ⁷⁰.

International Environmental Law This subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence. Scholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of \"noxious activity\" and prevention of \"information pollution.\"⁹⁵ The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the \"no harm\" principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas).⁹⁶ States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State.⁹⁷ In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed: \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory . . . to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another . . . ⁹³.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of \"natural resources ... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the \"neighbouring State\" concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103 We dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State.

The \"cyber-polluter\" should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable. Second, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to \"threat intelligence\" companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence, \"cyber-pollution\" should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126] Directing a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for \"cyber-pollution\" incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability.

An analogy with the marine environment also impractically extends the scope of cyber-diligence obligations to nationals outside territorial control. But it provides guidance for an adequate regulatory framework in cyber-diligence. ## D. International Law of the Sea Part XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"UNCLOS\") enshrines States' due diligence obligations within the marine environment. Article 192 establishes the general obligation to \"protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁴ Under Article 193, States enjoy the sovereign right to exploit natural resources, but must also take measures to prevent pollution to the marine environment.¹⁴⁵ Several differences arise when applying due diligence obligations in the marine environment compared to cyberspace. First, due diligence obligations under UNCLOS do not exclusively attach to sovereignty.¹⁴⁶ Vessels may operate in areas where States enjoy mutual rights. Articles 192 and 193 oblige flag States to ensure conservation of living resources, including in the exclusive economic zones of other States.¹⁴⁷ To discharge this obligation, flag States ought to ensure vessels within their jurisdiction and control \"do not undermine [their] obligations . . . to protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁸ The arbitral ¹⁴⁴.

A State’s cyber-diligence obligation should not extend to terminating a cyberattack initiated by a national abroad.¹⁵² In the sea, a flag vessel’s physical location is identifiable. A State’s due diligence obligation follows their flag vessels’ chartered territory. In cyberspace, a State exercises authority over infrastructure within their exclusive control both in their territory and extraterritorially.¹⁵³ But a State’s jurisdictional control of their nationals assumes different characteristics.

These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases. | | (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity. | Liu These measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State,¹⁶¹ and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity. Cyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured. International cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked. ## E.

Introduction International terrorism and cyberattacks share parallels. The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed.²⁰² We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\"²⁰³ A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.²⁰⁴ International terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats.²⁰⁵ These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law.²⁰⁶ They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory.²⁰⁷ Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity. ²⁰² Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear . . . to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.”²⁰⁸ A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.²⁰⁹ ## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison International law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats. Al-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network”²¹⁰ without a formal hierarchy.²¹¹ Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”.²¹² Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.²¹³ Anonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.”²¹⁴ The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream,",

The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling \"anons\" into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites.²¹⁶ In 2012, \"anons\" initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline. \"Operation Anti-ACTA\" responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.²¹⁷ Anonymous proclaimed that the agreement \"[enslaves] the internet.\"²¹⁸ While the government website was down, Polish politicians opposed to the agreement wore Guy Fawkes masks (the symbol of the Anonymous movement) in Parliament.²¹⁹ Private actors domiciled across different States accomplish Al-Qaeda and Anonymous' \"successes\". They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism.

In handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.”²²¹ States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.”²²² The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.²²³ Resolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations.²²⁴ States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation).²²⁵ These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security,²²⁶ which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.²²⁷ ²²⁰.

First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks. ## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision Resolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures.²³⁰ The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies,²³¹ and does not enforce sanctions on those who \"fail\" to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment. The U.N.

Knowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility.²⁵¹ States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it.²⁵² Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury.²⁵³ There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion.²⁵⁴ A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.²⁵⁵ This paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:",

Elsewhere, some commentators argue constructive knowledge should be presumed when a cyberattack implicates a State’s exclusive governmental infrastructure.²⁸¹ The aggrieved State ought to establish that the attack travelled through the territorial State’s governmental infrastructure.²⁸² Constructive knowledge is prima facie established if the infrastructure was under direct State control and used only for",

This paper now turns to the second trigger-element: injury. ## B. What Level of Injury Engages A Cyber-Diligence Duty? Injury is not a pre-requisite to finding an internationally wrongful act under the laws of State responsibility.³²¹ Once a breach is attributed to a State, responsibility is potentially engaged, subject to application of the primary rule.³²² In the context of due diligence, however, damage is a condition to finding a violation of the primary rule.³²³ A State who failed to exercise cyber-diligence is only liable for breaching the primary rule after hostile acts, contrary to another State's legal rights, occur.³²⁴ When \"due diligence is violated, there is an attribution to the State . . . of the consequences of the acts of [private] persons.\"³²⁵ ³²⁰.

Liu Not all cyberattacks engage a State's cyber-diligence obligation.³²⁶ Due diligence obligations derive from States' sovereign equality.³²⁷ States must exercise cyber-diligence to disable cyberattacks which detrimentally affect the legal rights of other States.³²⁸ Responsibility attaches when a cyberattack infracts the \"theoretical inviolability\" of a national legal order. Cyber-diligence obligations \"re-establish the status quo erat.\"³²⁹ With that in mind, this section defines \"serious injury\" to trigger States' cyber-diligence obligations. The Tallinn Manual defines an \"unlawful [cyber] act\" as \"all cyber activities from one State's territory that affect the rights of other States [producing] a negative effect.\"³³⁰ The definition covers any operation affecting \"sovereignty\": a lower level of injury compared to an act of interference³³¹ or armed force.³³² However, when is \"a negative effect\" of sufficient gravity to trigger cyber-diligence? Jurisprudence and the literature establish a context-dependent standard of serious injury. In *Trail Smelter*, the arbitral tribunal stated \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury . . . when the case is of serious consequence.\"³³³ Some commentators state that \"serious injury\" triggers the duty, without further explanation.³³⁴ The Tallinn Manual ambiguously concludes that \"physical damage to objects or injuries to ³²⁶.

In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.³³⁶ This paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories.³³⁷ We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation. The types of injury listed are non-exhaustive, but represent differing levels of severity. ## 1. Injury to Persons or Loss of Life; Physical Damage or Destruction of Objects Cyberattacks which cause physical damage equivalent to conventional attacks could constitute armed force or armed attack (when launched by a State).³³⁸ While discussions of *jus ad bellum* are beyond this paper’s scope, several observations should be made. First, category 1 represents cyberattack injury of the highest severity. Any physical harm to persons or objects would trigger a territorial State’s cyber-diligence obligation.³³⁹ But it is very rare for a cyberattack to cause category 1 damage.

Some argue that attacks on critical national infrastructure (such as water supply and electricity grids) would likely lead to secondary consequences of physical injury to persons and objects.³⁴⁰ An attack on one critical network has a “synergistic effect,”³⁴¹ propagating injury to other connected physical infrastructures. Such conclusions need to be balanced. The scale and duration of a cyberattack and the effectiveness of the target State’s response determines the likelihood of category 1 injuries. In 2015, for the first time, a cyberattack struck an electricity grid, in Ukraine. The attackers hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) systems in seven substations,³⁴² disconnecting power to 225,000 Ukrainians for three hours. Some had anticipated an “electronic Pearl Harbour” once a cyberattack hits an electric grid.³⁴³ This did not occur. The Ukrainian energy providers shifted to manual operations and restored electricity quickly. No physical damage to infrastructure occurred.³⁴⁴ Second, as yet, only State organs are equipped and motivated to inflict material injury using cyber-offensive capabilities.³⁴⁵ Such a cyberattack would automatically be considered an act of the State.³⁴⁶ Liability turns on attribution and the breach of an international",

Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries. Secondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack.³⁶⁷ The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm.³⁶⁸ Due diligence standards change according to “new scientific or technological knowledge [and] risks involved in the activity.”³⁶⁹ Primary injury to",

Liu Governments, in Cass Sunstein's words, should \"take careful steps to ensure that laws and policies reduce, and do not replicate, the errors to which fearful people are prone.\"⁴²¹ The same applies for international law. This paper assesses cyber-diligence practically, pre-empting how States may respond to a range of cyberattack outcomes. It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations. This paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an \"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\" of serious consequences from a cyberattack.⁴²² Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure. We do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example.⁴²³ Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects. \"Serious attacks\" affecting network functionality are few and far between.

The \"cyber-polluter\" should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable. Second, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to \"threat intelligence\" companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence, \"cyber-pollution\" should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126] Directing a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for \"cyber-pollution\" incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability.

Live trackers record over 6 million cyberattacks daily. Information technology-dependent societies increasingly perceive cyber-threats as a destabilising force and citizens inevitably look to the State for protection. This paper concerns one form of State protection: whether States owe due diligence obligations in cyberspace under the laws of State responsibility. Specifically, it re-examines the contents of such an obligation and the circumstances which could trigger it in light of cyberattacks' peculiarities. A straightforward replication of due diligence models from international environmental law or law of the sea is not appropriate. But cyber-diligence should incorporate certain principles found within both models and channel ultimate responsibility for securing cyber-infrastructure onto private industry. Counter-terrorism obligations are the most useful body of law in which to seek an analogy. This paper argues that a State's cyber-diligence obligation is triggered, at a minimum, by: (1) constructive knowledge of a cyberattack, (2) which causes serious injury to an operating network. These contents and triggers define a cyber-diligence framework. Public pressure on the State and the market to intensify responses to transnational cyber-threats will drive the adoption of such principles.\nKeywords: Information Technology Law, Non-State Actors, Cyber War, National Security, Internet Governance.\nThis paper was initially written in partial fulfilment of my LLB at Monash University.

CASE STUDY: “PATRIOTIC” HACKTIVISTS\nIn April 2001, a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet collide over the South China Sea. The Chinese F-8 crashes, killing its pilot. Meanwhile, the U.S. plane makes an emergency landing on Hainan Island. China detains twenty-four U.S. crew members for eleven days in a military base.\nA Sino-U.S. “cyber-war” commences. U.S. hackers retaliate against the crew’s detention, defacing Chinese websites with messages including: “first you China men try and take our plane and crew . . . what is next? Our home land? Our freedom?” In response, “patriotic” Chinese hacktivists strike back. In a self-branded “cyber-operation defending our country,” hacktivists deface U.S. “.gov” and “.com” websites, leaving messages, including: “long live Chinese nationality!” Notably, the hacktivists on both sides were private actors, who rationalized their actions as legitimate patriotic demonstrations. This fact has led some to speculate that the Chinese government’s information warfare strategy includes “sponsoring” Chinese hacktivists. The terminology\n1.

But attribution is only one possible test of State responsibility.\nWhat is a State's responsibility for its own actions or inaction during these cyberattacks? A due diligence obligation in cyberspace (\"cyber-diligence\"), if established, would offer victim States alternative legal recourse for a territorial State's breach of a primary obligation. Subject to the contents and triggers of the obligation defined below, China and the U.S. could invoke one another's responsibility for failing to prevent hacktivism within their territories. The failure could constitute an internationally wrongful act, which would then enable either State to seek reparations.\nThe present paper uses hacktivism as its opening case study to canvass the issue of State responsibility in cyberattacks. We now turn to examine, starting from first principles, the merits of including a cyber-diligence obligation as part of the State responsibility framework.\n10.

Introduction\nCyberspace has “developed from [networks] of academic researchers into a mainstream communications mechanism.” Unfortunately, enhanced information flow results in the medium’s misuse. States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction.\nMany States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure. Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements. “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence” all work against custom crystallizing. Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity\n16.

Obliging each State to take all available measures to stop cyberattacks which emanate from their territories would improve the security of interconnected networks globally.\nArguably, to date, no cyberattack has risen to the level of a use of force. Aggrieved States have not invoked State responsibility for a failure to prevent injurious cyberattacks. Yet, live trackers record over six million cyberattacks daily, and fear of cyber insecurity has gripped the world. States increasingly invest in cyber capabilities to protect against escalations in cyberattack severity, with cyberspace militarisation widely forecasted. Some commentators opine that cyber weapons are the next “weapon of choice” for terrorism. This kind of event could propel a global uptake and strict application of cyber-diligence.

It aims to comprehensively define the contents and triggers of a cyber-diligence obligation, and offer reasoned conclusions which States could implement in practice. The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void.\nThe present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to \"peacetime\" cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack. These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers. Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State.\nFirst, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty. Cyber-diligence should be classified as an obligation of conduct. As the International Court of Justice (\"I.C.J.\") states: \"the obligation of States [is] to [employ] all means reasonably available to them\" to prevent injurious activity. But a State does not\n27. Thomas M. Franck, What Happens Now? The United Nations after Iraq, 97 AM. J. INT.

However, States should implement the polluter pays principle. Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts.\nThird, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network.\nFourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation. An objective standard of due diligence, defined through best-practice exchanges, could provide a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of States’ compliance. But many States may not be\n Id.; James Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N. Doc.

States also have different capabilities to intervene in cyberspace. As a result, their capacity should limit their responsibility.\nCyberattacks transcend exclusive territorial control. But the threat does not necessitate a reinvention of international law. The proposed cyber-diligence framework preserves State-centric responsibility in cyberspace, extending post-Westphalian sovereignty to a relatively Hobbesian environment (which is barely 20 years old).

THE PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF DUE DILIGENCE IN STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## A. Due Diligence derives from Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nDue diligence is a corollary of States’ equal sovereignty. States enjoy plenary jurisdiction to control objects and subjects within their territory, but must also “respect . . . the territorial sovereignty and political integrity” of others. Flowing from States’ reciprocal respect, the I.C.J. famously articulated the due diligence obligation: “it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” Due diligence, accordingly, has developed into a general principle of international law.\n40.

States should exercise cyber-diligence over cyber activity within their “legal or regulatory control.” It is the concept of territorial sovereignty which underpins all due diligence obligations. But what is “territory” in cyberspace, when the realm has no physical boundaries?\nReferences to cyberspace in this paper adopt a dualistic character: the virtual domain which facilitates internet communications and the physical hardware sustaining the domain’s operation. Cyberspace, as an intangible medium, can only exist inside tangible infrastructure. It operates via “networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures” located within a State’s territory.\nWithin their territory, States enjoy exclusive legal authority over: (1) cyber-infrastructure; (2) cyber-activity associated with their cyberinfrastructure, and; (3) persons engaged in cyber activity. States should also bear a primary due diligence obligation to ensure that their infrastructure is not used to harm the equal sovereignty of other States. A State’s failure to exercise due diligence should constitute an internationally wrongful act.\n46. Memorandum from the U.S. Dep’t. of Defense, supra note 12.\n47.

But States ought to be informed of what positive actions fulfil the obligation (Section III) and when these actions should be undertaken (Section IV). First, this paper explores a characteristic of due diligence obligations: strong in adaptability but weak in enforcement.\n# III. CONTENTS OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\n## A. Obligation of Conduct versus Obligation of Result58\nDue diligence is a \"relative, not absolute,\"59 obligation of conduct. States have the discretion to adopt any feasible measures to prevent cyberattacks injuring other States,60 \"without warranting that the [attacks] will not occur.\"61 Breach of the obligation turns on whether a territorial State took all appropriate measures to protect the victim\nTY: THE GENERAL PART 227 (2013).\n56.

Whether the territorial State had “genuine capacity to avert the threat” in the circumstances informs the assessment.\nDue diligence obligations differ from obligations of result, which require that a State must prevent the occurrence of a cyberattack, regardless of the means employed. These obligations represent a State’s absolute guarantee to reach a precise outcome. Imposing an obligation of result in cyber-diligence would likely require States to adopt burdensome practices. Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.\n## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty\nObligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States. The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States. In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence . . . into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”\n.

INT’L L. 371, 375 (1999).\n\nHowever, an obligation of conduct's elasticity has deficiencies. First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks. Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation. Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.” As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises. The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”\nCyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”, establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained . . . the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”\nThis paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature. But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework.\n.

Cyber-Diligence should not adopt the Preventive Principle\nWe begin our examination with the preventive principle, a significant element within established due diligence models. The principle requires States to take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of transboundary damage where the risk is known.78 Preventive cyber-diligence would oblige States to create and maintain a clean infrastructural environment, in advance of any cyberattacks.79 We will not address the precautionary principle, which applies in the absence of scientific certainty that a risk will cause harm.80 It is settled that cyberattacks could cause serious injury.81\nSome commentators82—and a U.N. Working Group83—posit that States should undertake preventive cyber-diligence.84 The suggestions include:85\n78.

Monitoring suspicious activity.\nA number of these procedural steps constitute custom in international environmental law.[87] While these measures could obviate transboundary harm, they would do little to suppress ongoing or imminent cyberattacks. For instance, risk assessment identifies vulnerable networks. States could secure these networks, improve long-term network health, and make future cyberattacks harder to execute.[88] But risk assessment would do little to reduce injuries from a cyberattack that is underway. Hacktivists can launch attacks from infrastructure in States with lower cybersecurity,[89] diverting the source but not the effect of the eventual injury.[90] Another preventive measure could be to destroy malicious software (\"malware\") capable of being \"weaponized\" in a cyberattack. But nearly 200,000 new malware codes are identified daily.[91] The negligible effects of \"search and destroy\" operations do not warrant State expenditure.[92]\nPreventive measures are of minimal use when cyberattacks penetrate computer networks and cause instant injury. The territorial State should assist instead in the \"rescue effort\". They should engage skilled experts\nINCIDENTS: LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 60-61 (2010).\n86. See infra, III.B.3.\n87.

We shall demonstrate that a State's preventive duties should be confined to the circumstances in which it arose, transboundary environmental harm.\n## C. International Environmental Law\nThis subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence.\nScholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of \"noxious activity\" and prevention of \"information pollution.\" The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the \"no harm\" principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas). States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State. In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed: \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory . . . to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another . . .\n.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of \"natural resources ... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the \"neighbouring State\" concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103\nWe dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State. A cyberattack can be directed from any distant location connected to the internet and traverse\n98. Trail Smelter (U.S. v. Can.), 3 R.I.A.A. 1905, 1950 (Mixed Claims Comm'n 1938, 1941).\n99.

Id.\n\nnumerous States before it harms a network.\nSecond, the I.C.J.'s jurisprudential promotion of the preventive principle aims to secure the environment's long term sustainability and avoid disturbance to its ecological balance. Environmental damage cannot easily be undone. The harm's irreversibility underpins societies' willingness to adopt aggressive steps to control the perceived risk. This rationale is not transferable to cyberspace. Cyberspace, still in its infancy, has seemingly infinite resources. Permanent cyberspace degradation is not an issue: servers can be restored after attacks and security breaches can be repaired. At worst, physical infrastructure and data destroyed in a cyberattack still would not affect the overall functioning of the cyberspace domain.\nStates have no impetus to restrict private actors from \"polluting\" cyberspace. The \"tragedy of the commons\" theory reasons that \"we are locked into a system of fouling our own nest\". This is because the cost of the waste \"[a person] discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying [her] wastes.\" We do not foul the cyberspace \"nest\" because no amount of \"cyberwaste\" can (currently) overload and inhibit cyberspace functions. The medium fosters independent gain without fear of endangering the cyberspace platform.\nThe \"polluter pays\" principle should be applied to shift the duty of prevention onto private industry. (This should sit alongside States criminalising cyber-offences for individual liability.) As Alan Boyle suggests, \"it may be simpler, quicker, and economically more efficient to make polluters . . . pay rather than States.\" State regulations should\n.

International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 9 I.L.M.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nIn cyberspace, the polluter's \"payment\" should expand beyond monetary compensation (damages or taxes) to individual civil and criminal liability. The \"cyber-polluter\" should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable.\nSecond, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to \"threat intelligence\" companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence, \"cyber-pollution\" should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126]\nDirecting a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for \"cyber-pollution\" incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability. Consumer perception of network owners' cyber vulnerability could result in reputational and stock-price hits. The\n45, entered into force May 30, 1996.\n121.

State regulation should reinforce economic deterrence: “unclean” network owners should not receive government tenders and private contracts.\nBut emphasising private law reparations would have downsides. First, a private liability regime could dilute State responsibility, moving questions of cyber-diligence from public international law into private international law. The principle risks “exonerating certain subjects of international law from their share of responsibility for damage” caused by cyberattacks.\nSecond, civil liability does “not always [guarantee] real compensation for the damage caused to the environment.” A compensation scheme does not rectify the damage already caused to networks. To counter this inadequacy, States ought to take positive steps to terminate cyberattacks that are in progress and mitigate injury as far as possible. They should also bear cooperation duties to help restore injured networks post-cyberattack.\nIn limited State practice, victim States readily initiate prosecution under domestic criminal laws after they ascertain a hacker’s identity. In 2007, cyberattacks targeted Estonia’s government websites, e-services, and information infrastructure after Estonia removed a Soviet-era memorial. Attack methods included denial of service (“DOS”),\n. Tyler Moore, *Introducing the Economics of Cybersecurity: Principles and Policy Options, in NAT'L RES.

After the onslaught, Estonia sought to subject alleged hackers to computer sabotage crimes in their Penal Code. The U.S. has also prosecuted five Chinese hackers under their criminal code, despite the hackers being identified as members of the Chinese military, and by extension, carrying out official State organ functions.\nBut successful investigation and prosecution requires “dual criminality” of the cyberattack offence in both the victim State and the perpetrator’s domicile State. If the domicile State has not criminalized cyberattacks, they are unlikely to extradite their national for prosecution. Gathering sufficient evidence to prosecute would also be difficult: the victim State needs to access information held by the domicile State. For example, Russia refused to assist Estonia to identify hackers with Russian IP addresses. This occurred despite their bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.\nThis subsection demonstrates that the preventive principle should not be adopted in States’ cyber-diligence. Rather, despite its shortcomings, States should use the polluter pays principle to pressure industry to improve cybersecurity. States should implement the principle into domestic law as part of their cyber-diligence obligation.\nHaving established that the due diligence obligation in\n135.

As is taken up later, cyberspace, unlike the high seas, is not a res communis. An analogy with the marine environment also impractically extends the scope of cyber-diligence obligations to nationals outside territorial control. But it provides guidance for an adequate regulatory framework in cyber-diligence.\n## D. International Law of the Sea\nPart XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"UNCLOS\") enshrines States' due diligence obligations within the marine environment. Article 192 establishes the general obligation to \"protect and preserve the marine environment.\" Under Article 193, States enjoy the sovereign right to exploit natural resources, but must also take measures to prevent pollution to the marine environment.\nSeveral differences arise when applying due diligence obligations in the marine environment compared to cyberspace. First, due diligence obligations under UNCLOS do not exclusively attach to sovereignty. Vessels may operate in areas where States enjoy mutual rights. Articles 192 and 193 oblige flag States to ensure conservation of living resources, including in the exclusive economic zones of other States. To discharge this obligation, flag States ought to ensure vessels within their jurisdiction and control \"do not undermine [their] obligations . . . to protect and preserve the marine environment.\" The arbitral\n.

China knowingly tolerated “the propeller chopping method” exploiting living reefs across the Spratlys within their jurisdiction and control. China knew that their flagged vessels poached endangered species outside of their territorial control, which “[inflicted] significant damage on rare or fragile ecosystems.”\nAttaching due diligence obligations to the conduct of nationals would simply not work in the same way in cyberspace. A State’s cyber-diligence obligation should not extend to terminating a cyberattack initiated by a national abroad. In the sea, a flag vessel’s physical location is identifiable. A State’s due diligence obligation follows their flag vessels’ chartered territory. In cyberspace, a State exercises authority over infrastructure within their exclusive control both in their territory and extraterritorially. But a State’s jurisdictional control of their nationals assumes different characteristics. The operations of transnational non-State actors (and their data trails) are often borderless, simultaneously residing in multiple jurisdictions.\n.

Id. rule 2 cmt para. 3.\n\nConsider the diagram: a national of State A, physically located in State B, usurps networks in States C and D to launch attacks. For State A to terminate the cyberattacks, it needs to access networks in States C and D (constituting prohibited interference, $^{155}$  unless States C and D grant consent). In this situation, besides a duty of cooperation to assist a victim State's investigations of their national, State A should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation to terminate the cyberattack.\nSeparately, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea's (\"ITLOS\") Seabed Disputes Advisory Opinion articulates internal laws and regulations which States ought to adopt to fulfil due diligence obligations.[156] UNCLOS places due diligence obligations on States who engage contractors for projects within international waters (sponsoring States).[157] Sponsoring States are required to \"[adopt] laws\n155.

See infra, III.C.\n\n|  Extracted Principles | Cyber-Diligence Application  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (1) To fulfil due diligence obligations, sponsoring States must enact laws, regulations, and administrative measures enforcing the obligations of contractors.1 Contractual arrangements are insufficient.2 | Territorial States should: (1) criminalise cyberattacks causing serious injury in foreign territory and; (2) incentivise network owners to secure infrastructure.  |\n|  (2) “[The obligations] may include [establishing] enforcement mechanisms for active supervision of the activities of the sponsored contractor.”3 | States should:○ In grants and tenders, prioritise corporations with clean “track records” or those diligently securing their networks. These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases.  |\n|  (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity.  |\nLiu\nThese measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State, and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity.\nCyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured.\nInternational cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked.\n## E. An Assessment of International Cooperation in Cyberspace\nCurrently, two trends in cybersecurity cooperation can be observed:\n1. States engage in multilateral cooperation efforts within regional or political alliances.\n2. States implement cybersecurity cooperation between the public and private sectors, who share intelligence and coordinate\n. Seabed Mining, supra note 70, para. 218.\n.

As most networks are privately owned or managed, States coordinate use of the acquired expertise in situation (2).\nCybersecurity cooperation boosts cybersecurity in the long term, but does not enforce cooperative duties during and after particular cyberattacks. Political expediency presents an obstacle to cyberattack cooperation. For example, a bilateral agreement between Russia and Estonia enshrined “obligations” to transfer evidence, assist in investigations, and extradite alleged perpetrators of criminal offences. In spite of this, Russia refused to assist Estonia’s investigations after the 2007 cyberattacks. Russia’s interpretation of the treaty excluded surveillance measures identifying a perpetrator’s physical location. A restrictive interpretation conceals, perhaps, a lack of cooperative will. Some States possibly favour a poorly regulated cyberspace. States can leverage assistance to gain traction with allies, or refuse\nTY PLANNING (2016), http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Security-Planning/; EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY, EUROPEAN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENCE (EP3R) (2009) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies; German Federal Office for Information Security, IT-Grundschutz (2016), https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/; Shackleford, supra note 20, at 29.\n.

Conversely, States may not seek or provide assistance for fear of exposing their cyber vulnerabilities or cyber-technology.[173]\nCooperative duties nonetheless need to be \"clear, useful, and doable.\"[174] To complement current regimes, they ought to immediately contain a cyberattack. States should commission cybersecurity experts,[175] and:\n1. deploy their experts to secure critical (and vulnerable) networks domestically, reducing the risk of cyberattacks emanating from their territory; and\n2. in the event of an ongoing cyberattack, mobilize these experts in real-time to instantly upgrade network security.\nExperts could be exchanged between contracting agencies within cooperating States.[176] Each State could mobilize experts from multiple jurisdictions if cyberattacks occurred or if their private sector demanded increased protection. States with cyber-monitoring capabilities may warn others, in advance, of increased malicious traffic indicating imminent cyberattack(s).[177] A target State can then boost network capacity in anticipation. In ongoing cyberattacks, assisting States may host servers, transfer bandwidth, and eliminate botnet traffic.\nBut these suggestions remain aspirational. First, duties to co-operate are obligations of conduct \"formulated in a relatively weak way,\"[178] which do not drive outcomes. In Southern Bluefin Tuna, a treaty obligation required parties to \"consult, [and] resolve the dispute by negotiation or other peaceful means of their own choice.\"[179] The parties were only\n173.

A unilateral referral of the dispute to judicial settlement or arbitration was ineffective. Indeed, as the Estonia-Russia Treaty illustrates, States exercise discretion in their adherence to a cooperation treaty.\nSecond, some commentators stress that States bear a legal obligation to cooperate in reducing cyber threats, as cyberspace integrity is relevant to international security. Katharina Ziolkowski argues: “the internet presents another global resource [which is] in the common interest of the international community.” We ought to exercise caution before suggesting cooperative duties that have arisen within the natural environment or the seabed apply to cyberspace.\nUnlike the high seas, or outer space, cyberspace is not a “common concern of humankind” (res communis).

Cyberspace is not a natural, indivisible asset. Each State is encouraged to invest in cyberspace to reap economic, political, and social benefits.\nStates currently have no incentive to agree on a common regulatory regime in cyberspace. Doing so would decrease their margin of appreciation to set cyberspace priorities. Any common interests in cyberspace fasten on ensuring the platform's development, so that each State can advance their private interest. States increasingly “[establish sovereign control] in the virtual world in the name of security and economic sustainability.”\nThird, cooperative efforts will likely be limited to agreements between politically aligned States. The European Union has initiated best-practice and cyber-intelligence exchanges. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology collaborates with “the U.K., Japan, Korea, Estonia, Israel and Germany” to spread best practice in domestic cybersecurity.\nPerhaps this paper’s assessment of international cooperation appears overly negative. Initially, the above passages may indicate international law is epiphenomenal, allowing powerful States to grant their cooperation at will.

Prevention of Transnational Terrorism\n## 1. Introduction\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks share parallels. The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed. We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\" A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats. These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law. They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory. Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear . . . to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.” A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.\n## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison\nInternational law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network” without a formal hierarchy. Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”. Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.\nAnonymous is a hacktivist movement.

Its \"ops\" begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to \"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling \"anons\" into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites. In 2012, \"anons\" initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline. \"Operation Anti-ACTA\" responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.

They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.\n215. D.C.

Coleman, supra note 217.\n\n# 3. Incorporating the Counter-Terrorism Model of Due Diligence\nStates bear an obligation to prevent the terrorist conduct of non-State actors. The obligation existed within custom and conventions well before 9/11. However, this paper focuses on the counter-terrorism standard of due diligence established within Resolution 1373.\nIn handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.” States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.” The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.\nResolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations. States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation). These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security, which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.\n.

SAUL, supra note 202, at 21; Bardo Fassbender, The U.N. Security Council and\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nResolution 1373 established the Counter-Terrorism Committee (\"C.T.C.\") and required \"all States to report to the Committee . . . on the steps they have taken to implement this resolution.\"\nThe C.T.C. initiated a transnational \"capacity building blitz\". The S.C. should similarly establish a Cyber-Diligence Committee (\"C.D.C.\"). First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks.\n## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision\nResolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures. The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies, and does not enforce sanctions on those who \"fail\" to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment.\nThe U.N. General Assembly has established the Group of Governmental Experts in Information Security (\"G.G.E.\"), signalling an intention to centralise cybersecurity efforts.

The C.D.C's overall goal should be to assist (particularly developing) States building capacity to prevent cyberattacks. A gradual improvement in capacity throughout all 191 U.N. member States could decrease the frequency of cyberattacks, although this will take time, and requires ample financial resources.\nThe C.D.C's specific functions should resemble those of the C.T.C.: appoint experts to advise States on cyber-diligence compliance, coordinate assistance between donors and donees, and elicit compulsory written reports on States' capacity building measures. A C.D.C. reduces the discretion of States to determine appropriate measures for cyber-diligence. Through reviews, the C.D.C. should implicitly set a due diligence standard for States to meet in acquiring capacity. A C.D.C. should stress the relative nature of cyber-diligence and not stretch the obligation into one of absolute prevention. (It should centralize responsibility for co-ordinating cyber-diligence efforts, but preserve due diligence as an obligation of conduct.)\n233.

PROULX, supra note 212, at 79; BECKER, supra note 202, at 145.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nHowever, a capacity-building focus has limitations. It risks creating a disparity between States' reported capacity and their actual exercise of that capacity. Unresolved tensions include:\n1. whether the C.D.C. should impose effective enforcement mechanisms, or respect State decisions on internal social, economic, and political matters; and\n2. how the C.D.C. should determine which States: (i) do not have a genuine capacity to acquire or execute cyber-diligence (unable but willing), and; which States (ii) have the capacity (in reality) to exercise cyber-diligence, but decline to do so (able but unwilling).\nIn the counter-terrorism context, Tal Becker proposes that due diligence standards should apply to a State:\n1. acquiring the (legal, administrative, and resource) capacity to meet their due diligence obligations, and;\n2. “[employing] its capabilities with due diligence”.\nBecker’s proposed standards should be incorporated into States’ cyber-diligence obligations. The C.D.C. should supervise States’ compliance with limb (1). States who fail to notify the C.D.C. of their capacity deficits should be disentitled from pleading a lack of capacity if a subsequent cyberattack implicates their networks. This approach limits the responsibility of unable but willing States for a particular cyberattack, provided they have fulfilled limb (1) to the extent of their capacity. Other domestic exigencies may militate against\n. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128.\n. U.N. Charter art. 2(7).\n. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128; BARNIDGE JR., supra note 212, at 140-41; see also TRAPP, supra note 63, at 70-80.\n. BECKER, supra note 202, at 144-145; PROULX, supra note 212, at 17.\n. BECKER, supra note 209, at 146.\n\nLiu\na State's exercise of cyber-diligence capabilities. If so, a State should not be held in violation of limb (2), taking into account the particular circumstances at the time of the cyberattack.\nIf *able but unwilling* States simply ignore limb (2), establishing a failure to exercise cyber-diligence would be relatively straightforward. However, difficulties arise where *able but unwilling* States exercise cyber-diligence “half-heartedly”. For instance, a State could neutralise a third of the total botnets emanating from their territory (when they have the capacity to terminate the entire cyberattack). To establish violation, the victim State ought to prove that the territorial State did not employ their full capacity to prevent the cyberattack.\nThere is no “quick fix” to these tensions. Nonetheless, a C.D.C. should introduce an internationally calibrated strategy to capacity building in cyber-diligence. Far from being merely theoretical, 159 States have received counter-terrorism assistance as a result of the C.T.C. A C.D.C. realises the UN’s role of equipping States with the *capacity for* cyber-diligence, but not overstepping its intergovernmental character to intervene in States’ actual exercise of cyber-diligence.\nThis section argues that the contents of a State’s cyber-diligence obligation should include: (1) the “cyber-polluter pays” principle; (2) implementing regulations for industry to secure infrastructure, and; (3) capacity-building via consultation with the C.D.C. But States ought to know what circumstances enliven their obligation to fulfil these contents. The following section considers the two key triggers of cyber-diligence obligations: knowledge and injury.\n244. TRAPP, *supra* note 63, at 79.\n245.

Does Actual or Constructive Knowledge Trigger Cyber-Diligence?\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, a sovereign's responsibility for their subjects' actions consists of \"forbearance\" and \"protection shewn to transgressions.\" The sovereign must: (1) know of the transgression and; (2) fail to prevent or punish the delinquency.\nKnowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility. States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it. Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury. There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion. A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.\nThis paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:\n250. HUGO GROTIUS, DE JURE BELLI AC PACIS, Book II ch. XXI para. II (Nabu Press, 2011) (1625).\n251.

A botnet is \"a network of compromised computers.\" \"The bots\" are remotely controlled by the \"botherder\" and conduct coordinated cyber operations. There is no limit on the number of bots that can be \"recruited\". See Schmitt ed., supra note 25, at 257; COMMITTEE ON OFFENSIVE INFORMATION WARFARE, supra note 25, at 89.\n254. But see, infra IV.3.b.\n255. Unless the state itself launched the cyberattack, a fact that is exceedingly difficult to prove.\n\n1. Actual knowledge: a State knows of a cyberattack (where a State organ conducts the cyberattack);\n2. Conniance: a State wilfully shuts their eyes to the obvious occurrence of a cyberattack (for example, after detecting the cyberattack or being notified of it);\n3. Objective evidence leads to a logical conclusion that:\n- a State ought to have known of a cyberattack, or;\n- a State had information on a cyberattack, and was obliged to undertake further inquiries, but failed to do so;\n4. In the event a C.D.C. is adopted, States bear a heightened duty of vigilance to identify and eliminate threats within their territory. Constructive knowledge and an obligation to undertake further inquiries are built into this duty.\nCategories (1) – (2) constitute subjective knowledge, while categories (3) – (4) amount to constructive (objective) knowledge. First, we demonstrate that all four categories should suffice to trigger cyber-diligence. Second, we suggest an appropriate standard of proof to establish a territorial State’s knowledge before an international court or tribunal (“international tribunal”).\n## 1. Subjective Knowledge is Difficult to Establish\n### i. Categories 1 and 2\nSubjective knowledge is the highest degree of intent. A State either intended the cyberattack to cause serious injury, or endorsed the outcome. In judicial proceedings, victim States may struggle to establish a territorial State’s actual knowledge or connivance. The accused State’s sovereignty shrouds any evidence of subjective knowledge in secrecy. It is unthinkable that an accused State would surrender documents\n. Constantine Antonopoulos, *State Responsibility in Cyberspace*, in *Tsagourias &amp; Buchan eds*, supra note 35, at 69.\n. BROWNLIE, supra note 252, at 45, 152-53; Corfu Channel (U.K. v. Alb.), 1949 I.C.J. Rep. 4, para. 85 (Apr. 9) (Judge Azevedo).\nLiu\nrevealing internal decisions, especially given the lack of discovery procedures in State-on-State litigation.\nSome commentators posit that knowledge only arises when victim States notify territorial States of cyberattacks. In Tehran Hostages, the I.C.J. relied on notification to infer Iran's actual knowledge of militant raids. Iran was \"fully aware . . . of the urgent need for action,\" given \"repeated calls for help\" to the Iranian Foreign Ministry. Iran's inaction was \"due to more than mere negligence or lack of appropriate means.\"\nHowever, victim States rarely notify territorial States of a cyberattack. Notification consumes time, does little to reduce injury, and tarnishes inter-State relations. Instead, a State will likely devote their resources to withstanding a cyberattack. In the Estonian incident, botnet infiltrations implicated computers in 178 countries. Estonia did not notify one territorial State. Instead, Estonia increased bandwidth capacity (so networks could handle increased traffic), filtered malicious transmissions, and engaged U.S. and N.A.T.O. assistance to terminate sources of the attack. Some territorial States voluntarily neutralized sources of attacks.\nIn 2008, Georgia and Russia engaged in armed conflict over the South Ossetia region. Georgia suffered concurrent cyberattacks on their governmental, commercial and media networks, (supposedly) coordinated via Russian infrastructure. Georgia, a \"cyber-locked\" State, relied on neighbouring States' cyber infrastructure to facilitate\n258. Tribunals have questioned the veracity of leaked documents. Prosecutor v.

Georgia did not notify Russia of the cyberattacks, instead relocating important servers to the U.S. Google's secure servers temporarily hosted a news portal, and NATO also secured Georgian networks.\nIf only notification could enliven knowledge, then no cyber-diligence could ever be triggered in incidents like the cyberattacks on Estonia and Georgia. Victim States mitigate loss and boost defences when a cyberattack begins. Politically allied States disable attack sources and offer relief networks. Victim States do not benefit from notification.\nThe knowledge threshold to trigger cyber-diligence should be lowered. Kimberley Trapp argues (in the counter-terrorism context): \"requiring proof of subjective knowledge would effectively act as a bar to any finding of responsibility for a failure to prevent.\" A territorial State's cyber-diligence obligation should be triggered if they \"ought to have known\" of a cyberattack.\n## 2. Constructive Knowledge Should Trigger Cyber-Diligence Obligations\n### i. Category 3\nInternational jurisprudence supports constructive knowledge triggering due diligence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J's majority judgment relied on a series of inferences to conclude that the minefield laying \"could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of Albania.\" The majority inferred Albania's knowledge according to objective standards.\n.

Corfu Channel, supra note 44, at 19-20.\nLiu\nThe U.K. was not required to prove Albania knew (subjectively) of the mines' presence. Notably, two dissentients (Judge Azevedo and Judge Krylov) held Albania was under a continuous duty to inform itself of reasonably foreseeable threats in its territory, or, as Ian Brownlie argues, “[to] take reasonable care to discover activities of trespassers.”\nIn the Bosnian Genocide case, the I.C.J. found that a State’s obligation to prevent the occurrence of genocide is engaged “at the instant that the State learns of, or should normally have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.” Engaging the obligation to prevent genocide is tantamount to triggering cyber-diligence if the State should have reasonably known of the attack’s occurrence.\nIn Asian Agricultural Products, the Tribunal emphasized Sri Lanka bore a duty to exercise “[an] ‘objective’ standard of vigilance in assessing the required degree of protection and security . . . for foreign investors.” The language of these cases suggest that constructive knowledge should be established if the territorial State had information that a cyberattack might occur and failed to conduct further inquiries.\nElsewhere, some commentators argue constructive knowledge should be presumed when a cyberattack implicates a State’s exclusive governmental infrastructure. The aggrieved State ought to establish that the attack travelled through the territorial State’s governmental infrastructure. Constructive knowledge is prima facie established if the infrastructure was under direct State control and used only for\n275. Id.; TRAPP, supra note 63, at 69; BECKER, supra note 202, at 134.\n276.

Many states lack the technical expertise to collect and analyse such evidence, so outsourcing is likely required.\n\npublic purposes.283\nThis approach should be tempered. Indications of government infrastructure's involvement in a cyberattack can be deceiving. First, non-State hackers may compromise a government server.284 A cyberattack being mounted from government infrastructure does not in itself establish responsibility in the cyber context.285\nSecond, cyberattacks are often dressed with \"spoofing\" (identify manipulation) techniques. In the Estonian incident, spoofing clouded evidence which incriminated Moscow's exclusive infrastructure: unknown perpetrators could have adopted the veil of a Moscow government computer.286 Often, \"onion routing\" techniques are used to conceal perpetrators' identity.287 The majority of cyberattacks use such masquerading tactics.288 Even if network logs suggest a cyberattack exploited government infrastructure, the victim State should still be bound to adduce evidence to dismiss spoofing concerns.\nSome commentators stretch the presumption of constructive knowledge further. They advocate a reverse presumptio juris whenever a cyberattack is associated with government infrastructure,289 or when \"injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State.\"290 International tribunals would shift the burden of proof onto the territorial State, who must disprove their presumed constructive knowledge.291\n283.

Ryan et al., supra note 289.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nReversal of the burden of proof conflicts with I.C.J. jurisprudence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J. did not infer Albania's constructive knowledge of injurious activity purely based on their exclusive territorial control. Territorial control does not “[shift] the burden of proof . . . in relation to unlawful acts perpetrated therein.” In Pulp Mills, the I.C.J. stated “a preventive approach . . . does not [operate] as a reversal of the burden of proof.” It is not for the territorial State to prove its diligence. State control over governmental networks only gives rise to “abstract and immaterial knowledge” of a cyberattack, insufficient to presume State responsibility.\nBut victim States may use the accused State's control over government infrastructure as evidence. Section IV.A.3. explains how a pattern of such evidence should establish constructive knowledge. But first, we examine how constructive knowledge would operate under category 4.\n## ii. Category 4\nWith reference to Section III.F.3., should a C.D.C. framework be established, a degree of constructive knowledge should be presumed. Territorial States would be held to a standard of vigilance in maintaining their cyber-territory, and constructive knowledge of an ongoing or imminent attack would be imputed to these States. States would have less latitude to plead a lack of capacity to discover a particular cyberattack.\nPresuming knowledge would reflect heightened expectations for State compliance with cyber-diligence obligations. The victim State still bears the burden of proof and should establish knowledge\n292.

Overcoming the Evidentiary Hurdle: Standard of Proof\nTypically, a failure in due diligence will be raised after the victim State (“applicant”) suffers injury. The issue turns to causation. How does the applicant gather sufficient evidence to establish that actual or constructive knowledge triggered the territorial State’s (“respondent”) cyber-diligence obligation? The applicant will struggle to establish their case absent the respondent’s assistance or at least consent to evidence collection.\nThe I.C.J. acknowledges that victim States face evidentiary difficulties, allowing a “more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence . . . provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.” But the standard of proof in an international tribunal should not be lowered “simply because it is . . . difficult to reach.” The standard “[protects] the respondent against false attribution . . . a particularly serious risk in the cyber context.”\nThe applicant must produce reliable and neutral evidence to establish that the respondent at least ought to have known of the cyberattack.

The applicant may also produce documentary data and press reports to establish the respondent had sufficient information to make further inquiries into the cyberattack, but failed to do so.\nSome commentators advocate for a “very liberal approach to evidence [in cyberspace].” They contrast the anonymity of cyberattacks against kinetic threats, which are physically traceable, before, during, and after the attack.\nHowever, the primary rule invoked in a matter determines the standard of proof. International tribunals should not adopt a low standard of proof in due diligence matters. As Durward Sandifer argues: “in dealing with sovereign States . . . it cannot lightly be presumed that one of the parties to the litigation is guilty of negligence.” Doing so may result in evidence of low probative value establishing a breach of due diligence, which would undercut the presumption that States observe international law. Conversely, the standard of proof should not be so “unduly exacting” that it becomes impossible to meet.\nRep. 2014 (Mar. 31), p. 226, 237 paras 18-20, 255-57 paras 73-82, 283 paras 188-90, 290-93 paras 217-227; The South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of Philippines v.

It also incentivizes States to secure (at least) their governmental infrastructure. But the approach does not prejudice States who lack the capacity to safeguard their governmental infrastructure.\nQuestions of a State's actual or constructive knowledge are contingent on a judicial forum's evidentiary standards. Together, they form the \"knowledge\" element to trigger cyber-diligence obligations. A threshold of constructive knowledge proven to a clear and convincing standard has been advanced. This paper now turns to the second trigger-element: injury.\n## B. What Level of Injury Engages A Cyber-Diligence Duty?\nInjury is not a pre-requisite to finding an internationally wrongful act under the laws of State responsibility. Once a breach is attributed to a State, responsibility is potentially engaged, subject to application of the primary rule. In the context of due diligence, however, damage is a condition to finding a violation of the primary rule. A State who failed to exercise cyber-diligence is only liable for breaching the primary rule after hostile acts, contrary to another State's legal rights, occur. When \"due diligence is violated, there is an attribution to the State . . . of the consequences of the acts of [private] persons.\"\n. See infra, V.\n.

States must exercise cyber-diligence to disable cyberattacks which detrimentally affect the legal rights of other States. Responsibility attaches when a cyberattack infracts the \"theoretical inviolability\" of a national legal order. Cyber-diligence obligations \"re-establish the status quo erat.\" With that in mind, this section defines \"serious injury\" to trigger States' cyber-diligence obligations.\nThe Tallinn Manual defines an \"unlawful [cyber] act\" as \"all cyber activities from one State's territory that affect the rights of other States [producing] a negative effect.\" The definition covers any operation affecting \"sovereignty\": a lower level of injury compared to an act of interference or armed force.\nHowever, when is \"a negative effect\" of sufficient gravity to trigger cyber-diligence? Jurisprudence and the literature establish a context-dependent standard of serious injury. In *Trail Smelter*, the arbitral tribunal stated \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury . . . when the case is of serious consequence.\" Some commentators state that \"serious injury\" triggers the duty, without further explanation. The Tallinn Manual ambiguously concludes that \"physical damage to objects or injuries to\n. See infra, III.B.\n.

The concept does not define what measures a State should take during the occurrence of the injury. In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.\nThis paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories. We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation. The types of injury listed are non-exhaustive, but represent differing levels of severity.\n## 1. Injury to Persons or Loss of Life; Physical Damage or Destruction of Objects\nCyberattacks which cause physical damage equivalent to conventional attacks could constitute armed force or armed attack (when launched by a State). While discussions of *jus ad bellum* are beyond this paper’s scope, several observations should be made.\nFirst, category 1 represents cyberattack injury of the highest severity. Any physical harm to persons or objects would trigger a territorial State’s cyber-diligence obligation. But it is very rare for a cyberattack to cause category 1 damage.

Some argue that attacks on critical national infrastructure (such as water supply and electricity grids) would likely lead to secondary consequences of physical injury to persons and objects. An attack on one critical network has a “synergistic effect,” propagating injury to other connected physical infrastructures.\nSuch conclusions need to be balanced. The scale and duration of a cyberattack and the effectiveness of the target State’s response determines the likelihood of category 1 injuries. In 2015, for the first time, a cyberattack struck an electricity grid, in Ukraine. The attackers hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) systems in seven substations, disconnecting power to 225,000 Ukrainians for three hours. Some had anticipated an “electronic Pearl Harbour” once a cyberattack hits an electric grid. This did not occur. The Ukrainian energy providers shifted to manual operations and restored electricity quickly. No physical damage to infrastructure occurred.\nSecond, as yet, only State organs are equipped and motivated to inflict material injury using cyber-offensive capabilities. Such a cyberattack would automatically be considered an act of the State. Liability turns on attribution and the breach of an international\n340.

A State may forego invoking intermediary cyber-diligence breaches if the injury is serious, preferring to treat it instead as armed force or armed attack so as to enliven jus ad bellum. Non-State hacktivists rarely (if ever) cause physical injury. Hackers instead inundate networks with DDOS attacks or implant malware and extract information.[347]\nThird, no reported cyberattack has yet caused injury to persons or loss of life.[348] Some have come close: hackers infiltrated a hospital network and lethally altered a patient's dosages, only to be discovered by a nurse before the drug was administered.[349] Debate exists about whether the 2010 Stuxnet virus actually caused physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.[350] Stuxnet took control of SCADA networks, manipulated data and controlled the processing speed of centrifuges. One commentator argues that the injury suffered was a mere usurpation of the SCADA networks and not injury to the physical integrity of the centrifuges.[351] Apart from Stuxnet, to date, we have been unable to identify a single cyberattack which has caused physical damage to a network's physical components and not merely destroying data or incapacitating network functions.[352]\nCyberattacks overloaded and temporarily suspended networks in the Estonian and Georgian incidents.[353] But, despite social and economic disruptions, no network reportedly suffered destructive or permanent\n347.

A rigid requirement of physical damage or destruction (perhaps more suited to conventional attacks) $^{354}$  is inappropriate for cyber-diligence. The cyber-diligence obligation prevents injury to cyber networks and infrastructure. A lower level of damage should also trigger cyber-diligence. One commentator notes: \"the dependency of modern societies on [computer] networks has made it possible to incapacitate physical infrastructures without destroying them.\" $^{355}$\n# 2. Loss of Network Functionality $^{356}$\nMost cyberattack methods disrupt target networks. Cyberattacks could overwhelm a network with botnet requests, cause system malfunction, or otherwise degrade the quality of network services.[357] Herbert Lin distinguishes between a (destructive) \"cyberattack\" and a (non-destructive) \"cyber-exploitation\".[358] The former renders a network unavailable, or undermines the network's integrity, without destroying any physical components.[359] For instance, DDOS attacks on Estonian infrastructure temporarily reduced accessibility to crucial services in the financial, telecommunications, media, and government sectors.[360] The attack significantly hindered the ability to conduct financial transactions, resulting in losses to industry and Estonian citizens.[361]\nThis paper argues that once a cyberattack causes serious disruptions to a network's proper functioning, the cyberattack is then \"destructive\",\n354.

Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries.\nSecondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack. The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm. Due diligence standards change according to “new scientific or technological knowledge [and] risks involved in the activity.” Primary injury to\n362.

If predictions of cyberattacks on health systems or transportation infrastructure materialise, the standard of cyber-diligence should rise to correspond to the increased risk. States should be obligated, with reference to the primary infrastructure affected, to take proportionate action to prevent or reduce secondary injuries (to the extent possible).\n## 3. Cyber-Exploitations\nThe third category of \"injury\" results from stealthily executed cyber activities, unknown the victim. \"Cyber-exploitation\" describes an activity intended to clandestinely access and exploit a network's vulnerabilities without disturbing the network's operation. Intelligence gathering operations most frequently cause this \"injury\". Hackers emplace malware into a network to collect information for economic or political purposes. Cyber-exploitations could also probe a network for vulnerabilities in preparation for future cyberattacks.\nThe term \"injury\" is hesitantly used to refer to category (3). It is unclear what injury cyber-exploitation actually causes to a victim State. \"[An] infringement of rights or legally protected interests\" activates cyber-diligence obligations. The question turns on whether peacetime cyber-exploitation infringes a target State's territorial sovereignty.\nArguably, covert cyber-exploitations which intrude on a network and extract data violate the \"honor, dignity or prestige of a State\"\n370.

Data collection programs including Ghostnet, PRISM and Tempora continue, implicitly tolerated by States, who \"will not want to deprive themselves of this tool.\" There is no clear answer as to whether cyber-exploitations constitute \"serious injury\" for cyber-diligence purposes. Invoking another State's failure to prevent cyber-exploitation will likely be perceived as hypocritical.\nThe Committee on Offensive Information Warfare notes that \"the distinction between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation may be very hard to draw from a technical standpoint and may lie primarily in the intent of the user.\" Indeed, a single cyberattack can cause category (2) and (3) effects.

The two infiltrations complement each other: the software assesses the network's vulnerabilities and determines a \"sweet spot\" to trigger the logic bomb, so as to cause the most injury. The (initially) non-destructive operation can mature, in real time, into a destructive cyberattack.\nSuccessful cyber-exploitation, which operates within a network, normally goes unnoticed. Cyber-diligence cannot be triggered without sufficient knowledge and should only be triggered when destructive effects materialise.\n## 4. Cyber-Vandalism, Irritation and Computer Crime\nThe Tallinn Manual regards \"mere irritation or inconvenience\" as not of sufficient seriousness to trigger cyber-diligence. Low-intensity cyber-vandalism does not cause serious disruption to a State and is appropriately classified as a domestic cybercrime under the Budapest Convention. 85% to 97% of all cybercrimes are not revealed let alone prosecuted. Such laxity in enforcement demonstrates States' passive tolerance of low-intensity cybercrimes. To counter \"close to unlimited\" instances of cyber-vandalism, States should improve domestic cybercrime regulation and dedicate cyber-diligence resources to preventing higher categories of injury.\nMarco Roscini argues that defacement alters computer data and should be characterized as a disruptive cyberattack (category 2\n385.

But it is difficult to see how defacement and propaganda goes beyond “visual corruption of public webpages”. Defacement may be considered offensive or even slanderous, depending on the target State’s political orientation. But unlike “destructive” cyberattacks, defacement merely causes superficial injuries to a network. Hacktivists intend to transmit unwanted political messages, not to overthrow a regime. *Oppenheim’s International Law* notes that due diligence obligations do not extend to “suppress[ing] criticism of, or propaganda directed against, other States or governments on the part of private persons.” Roscini himself recognizes that defacement is “relatively innocuous [and] psychological.” Cyber-diligence should not “imply an obligation to suppress all such conduct [inimical to] the regime or policy of a foreign State.”\nDespite the difficulties of retrospectively evaluating “serious injury”, this threshold reflects States’ concerns about cyberattacks which disable infrastructural operations. Under our formulation, cyber-exploitation and defacement fall below the threshold. States would likely avoid burdensome cyber-diligence for cyber activity of low-intensity, largely tolerated internationally.\nThe final section outlines hypothetical cyberattack scenarios and explores whether best-practice exchanges could set an implicit standard of cyber-diligence.\n392.

ASSESSING BREACH OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\nThe preceding sections define the contents and triggers of cyber-diligence obligations. This paper now discusses violation of the primary obligation.\nBreach of the primary obligation fastens on a State's knowledge, capacity to prevent, and the level of injury caused. Pierre-Marie Dupuy states: \"the true breach of an obligation of conduct is the breach of an obligation to behave (in a legally defined way).\" The accusing State needs to establish that they would not have suffered injury, or would have suffered less injury, if the accused State exercised cyber-diligence. Injury is not the decisive element. Breach is evaluated according to whether, at the origin of the injury, a State failed to do all it could to prevent the end result. As soon as a territorial State does not take all appropriate measures to stop a cyberattack, the cyber-diligence obligation has been violated.\nThe obligation, articulated in theory, does not capture the infinite scenarios which may arise in practice, including when:\n1. A lesser-able State puts their limited capacity to diligent use, doing all they can to stop a cyberattack.\n2. A State has sound cyber-capabilities in general, but is \"resource-poor\" at the time of the cyberattack. The State may have allocated intense resources to other priorities and is unable to terminate the cyberattack.\n3. A State with sound cyber-capabilities, both generally and at the time of a cyberattack, decides not to terminate the cyberattack.\n. Dupuy, supra note 69, at 379.\n. Id.; Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/498, 28 [86]; cf. Crawford, supra note 201, at 310.\n. Economides, supra note 60, at 377.\n. BECKER, supra note 202, at 151-52.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nThese situations are highly abstract and all presuppose that a State has requisite knowledge and that the cyberattack causes serious injury. Variable factors across these situations determine breach. Assessment of breach ought to be “realistic and context-sensitive,” particularized to the circumstances in question. Theoretically, the State in situation (1) has exercised cyber-diligence to the extent of their capabilities, satisfying the obligation. The State in situation (3) has, by contrast, failed to do all it could to stop the cyberattack, and breaches their obligation. Situation (2) is less clear: international law does not dictate States’ domestic resource-allocation.\nIn reality, establishing responsibility is not straightforward. To evade responsibility, an accused State could claim:\n1. they exercised their best efforts, yet still failed to achieve a result in the face of new cyberattack methods;\n2. a lack of capacity at the time of a cyberattack, given other exigencies; or\n3. they lacked sufficient knowledge of the cyberattacks.\nThe accusing State then bears the unenviable burden of establishing breach.\nPredicting a breach of cyber-diligence with confidence is difficult. First, there is no minimum standard of cyber-diligence to measure compliance against. Second, a State’s acquiescence to a cyberattack is also likely to be covert and publicly denied. Third, cyber-diligence is a “moveable target”, constantly evolving as cyberspace technology develops.\n402.

Seabed Mining, Advisory Opinion, supra note 70, para. 117.\nLiu\nThe 2015 G.G.E. report recommended that the U.N. \"consider initiatives for international dialogue and exchange on ICT security issues.\" A C.D.C. which encompasses \"U.N. agencies, the private sector, academia and civil society organisations\" could facilitate best-practice exchanges. S.C. Resolution 1377 invited the C.T.C. to promote counter-terrorism best-practice and prepare model laws. A C.D.C. could do the same, and implicitly define an expected standard of care for cyber-diligence between member States.\nBest Management Practices (\"BMPs\") in counter-piracy provide a useful example of the best-practices approach to solving problems. Devised by the International Marine Organisation and the shipping industry, the BMPs increased vessels' successful resistance to piracy by 25%. Adopting these self-help recommendations (including such matters as speed, security equipment, and watchkeeping) were in the vessels' best interests. Compliance minimized insurance premiums and decreased the probability of pirate capture.\nThere is no guarantee that adopting and disseminating best-practice will achieve these results for cyber-diligence. Cyber-powers or private industries must be willing to share their (actual) best-practices before any dialogue improves cyber-diligence capabilities. Private industry could monetise cyberattack prevention capabilities and offer their services to the highest bidder. There is limited transparency in cybersecurity efforts: States and industry are unlikely to openly disclose the full extent of their technical capacity. Improving cyber-diligence may not be favourable to the geopolitical agendas of some\n408. Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications, U.N. Doc.

We hope that cyber-defence technology matures and is shared through best-practice dialogue. It remains unclear whether best-practice compliance will become attractive to States.\n# VI. CONCLUSIONS\nOur world is increasingly digital. Cyber-infrastructure now underpins many of the essential features of a modern society. Cyberspace pervades our lives and the dangers of its ill-use are publicly recognized. Citizens reap the benefits of cyber-technology, at the same time expecting governments to shield them from transnational cyber-threats.\nOn interconnected threats, the U.N. Secretary General has remarked: “we must found a new security consensus, the first article of which must be that . . . whatever threatens one threatens all.” Indeed, cyber-technology disregards political and cultural borders and grants unlimited reach to private actors. But there is no need to panic.\n415. Jason Fritz, *How China will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness*, 8 CULT. MANDALA 28 (2008).\n416. Czosseck, *supra* note 9, at 16.\n417.

A/59/2005 (2005), p. 25 para. 81.\nLiu\nGovernments, in Cass Sunstein's words, should \"take careful steps to ensure that laws and policies reduce, and do not replicate, the errors to which fearful people are prone.\" The same applies for international law.\nThis paper assesses cyber-diligence practically, pre-empting how States may respond to a range of cyberattack outcomes. It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an \"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\" of serious consequences from a cyberattack. Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example. Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects. \"Serious attacks\" affecting network functionality are few and far between. But the Estonian and Georgian incidents demonstrate that they can occur.\nAt a minimum, to establish breaches of cyber-diligence, the victim\n. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 226.\n. Id. at 39; SUNSTEIN, supra note 80, at 120.\n. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 45.\nLiu\nState must produce clear and convincing evidence:\n1. of the territorial State's constructive knowledge, and;\n2. that the cyberattack caused category (1) (physical destruction) or category 2 (incapacitation) injury to objects or subjects within their territory.\nThe above elements establish a cyber-diligence framework. It is hoped that the framework matches States' concerns in practice and can guide their cybersecurity policies. Beijing and Washington, from our opening example, should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation in relation to defacement of each other's websites. Even if constructive knowledge can be established, the hacktivism did not cause injury of the requisite threshold to trigger the obligation.\nCyber-diligence will continue to be debated within academia before States employ relevant measures. It is hoped that this paper contributes a balanced response to the present scholarship.\nIV Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 191-260 (April 2017)\n\n# Footnotes from table in section III.D.\n1.

International Environmental Law This subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence. Scholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of \"noxious activity\" and prevention of \"information pollution.\"⁹⁵ The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the \"no harm\" principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas).⁹⁶ States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State.⁹⁷ In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed: \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory . . . to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another . . . ⁹³.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of \"natural resources ... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the \"neighbouring State\" concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103 We dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State.

These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases. | | (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity. | Liu These measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State,¹⁶¹ and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity. Cyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured. International cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked. ## E.

State Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations 223 Liu # F. Prevention of Transnational Terrorism ## 1. Introduction International terrorism and cyberattacks share parallels. The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed.²⁰² We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\"²⁰³ A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.²⁰⁴ International terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats.²⁰⁵ These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law.²⁰⁶ They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory.²⁰⁷ Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity. ²⁰² Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear . . . to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.”²⁰⁸ A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.²⁰⁹ ## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison International law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats. Al-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network”²¹⁰ without a formal hierarchy.²¹¹ Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”.²¹² Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.²¹³ Anonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.”²¹⁴ The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream,"

Live trackers record over 6 million cyberattacks daily. Information technology-dependent societies increasingly perceive cyber-threats as a destabilising force and citizens inevitably look to the State for protection. This paper concerns one form of State protection: whether States owe due diligence obligations in cyberspace under the laws of State responsibility. Specifically, it re-examines the contents of such an obligation and the circumstances which could trigger it in light of cyberattacks' peculiarities. A straightforward replication of due diligence models from international environmental law or law of the sea is not appropriate. But cyber-diligence should incorporate certain principles found within both models and channel ultimate responsibility for securing cyber-infrastructure onto private industry. Counter-terrorism obligations are the most useful body of law in which to seek an analogy. This paper argues that a State's cyber-diligence obligation is triggered, at a minimum, by: (1) constructive knowledge of a cyberattack, (2) which causes serious injury to an operating network. These contents and triggers define a cyber-diligence framework. Public pressure on the State and the market to intensify responses to transnational cyber-threats will drive the adoption of such principles.\nKeywords: Information Technology Law, Non-State Actors, Cyber War, National Security, Internet Governance.\nThis paper was initially written in partial fulfilment of my LLB at Monash University.

Our home land? Our freedom?”⁴ In response, “patriotic” Chinese hacktivists strike back. In a self-branded “cyber-operation defending our country,”⁵ hacktivists deface U.S. “.gov” and “.com” websites,⁶ leaving messages, including: “long live Chinese nationality!”⁷ Notably, the hacktivists on both sides were private actors, who rationalized their actions as legitimate patriotic demonstrations.⁸ This fact has led some to speculate that the Chinese government’s information warfare strategy includes “sponsoring” Chinese hacktivists.⁹ The terminology\n1.

Introduction\nCyberspace has “developed from [networks] of academic researchers into a mainstream communications mechanism.”¹⁶ Unfortunately, enhanced information flow results in the medium’s misuse. States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction.\nMany States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure.¹⁷ Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements.¹⁸ “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence”¹⁹ all work against custom crystallizing.²⁰ Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity\n16.

Aggrieved States have not invoked State responsibility for a failure to prevent injurious cyberattacks. Yet, live trackers record over six million cyberattacks daily,²² and fear of cyber insecurity has gripped the world.²³ States increasingly invest in cyber capabilities to protect against escalations in cyberattack severity,²⁴ with cyberspace militarisation widely forecasted.²⁵ Some commentators opine that cyber weapons are the next “weapon of choice” for terrorism.²⁶ This kind of event could propel a global uptake and strict application of cyber-diligence.

The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void.\nThe present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to \"peacetime\" cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack.²⁸ These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers.²⁹ Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State.\nFirst, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty. Cyber-diligence should be classified as an obligation of conduct. As the International Court of Justice (\"I.C.J.\") states: \"the obligation of States [is] to [employ] all means reasonably available to them\"³⁰ to prevent injurious activity. But a State does not\n27. Thomas M. Franck, What Happens Now? The United Nations after Iraq, 97 AM. J. INT.

Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts.\nThird, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network.\nFourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation. An objective standard of due diligence, defined through best-practice exchanges, could provide a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of States’ compliance.³³ But many States may not be\n³¹ Id.; James Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N.

THE PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF DUE DILIGENCE IN STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## A. Due Diligence derives from Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace⁴⁰\nDue diligence is a corollary of States’ equal sovereignty.⁴¹ States enjoy plenary jurisdiction to control objects and subjects within their territory,⁴² but must also “respect . . . the territorial sovereignty and political integrity” of others.⁴³ Flowing from States’ reciprocal respect, the I.C.J. famously articulated the due diligence obligation: “it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴ Due diligence, accordingly, has developed into a general principle of international law.⁴⁵\n40.

But States ought to be informed of what positive actions fulfil the obligation (Section III) and when these actions should be undertaken (Section IV). First, this paper explores a characteristic of due diligence obligations: strong in adaptability but weak in enforcement.\n# III. CONTENTS OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\n## A. Obligation of Conduct versus Obligation of Result58\nDue diligence is a \"relative, not absolute,\"59 obligation of conduct. States have the discretion to adopt any feasible measures to prevent cyberattacks injuring other States,60 \"without warranting that the [attacks] will not occur.\"61 Breach of the obligation turns on whether a territorial State took all appropriate measures to protect the victim\nTY: THE GENERAL PART 227 (2013).\n56.

Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.⁶⁶\n## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty\nObligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States.⁶⁷ The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States.⁶⁸ In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence . . . into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”⁶⁹\n⁶².

First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks.⁷⁰ Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation.⁷¹ Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.”⁷² As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises.⁷³ The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”⁷⁴\nCyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”,⁷⁵ establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained . . . the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”⁷⁶\nThis paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature.⁷⁷ But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework.\n⁷⁰.

Cyber-Diligence should not adopt the Preventive Principle\nWe begin our examination with the preventive principle, a significant element within established due diligence models. The principle requires States to take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of transboundary damage where the risk is known.78 Preventive cyber-diligence would oblige States to create and maintain a clean infrastructural environment, in advance of any cyberattacks.79 We will not address the precautionary principle, which applies in the absence of scientific certainty that a risk will cause harm.80 It is settled that cyberattacks could cause serious injury.81\nSome commentators82—and a U.N. Working Group83—posit that States should undertake preventive cyber-diligence.84 The suggestions include:85\n78.

Consultations on preventive measures with \"interested\" States;\n3. International cybersecurity cooperation, and;\n4. Monitoring suspicious activity.\nA number of these procedural steps constitute custom in international environmental law. While these measures could obviate transboundary harm, they would do little to suppress ongoing or imminent cyberattacks. For instance, risk assessment identifies vulnerable networks. States could secure these networks, improve long-term network health, and make future cyberattacks harder to execute. But risk assessment would do little to reduce injuries from a cyberattack that is underway. Hacktivists can launch attacks from infrastructure in States with lower cybersecurity, diverting the source but not the effect of the eventual injury. Another preventive measure could be to destroy malicious software (\"malware\") capable of being \"weaponized\" in a cyberattack. But nearly 200,000 new malware codes are identified daily. The negligible effects of \"search and destroy\" operations do not warrant State expenditure.\nPreventive measures are of minimal use when cyberattacks penetrate computer networks and cause instant injury. The territorial State should assist instead in the \"rescue effort\". They should engage skilled experts\nINCIDENTS: LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 60-61 (2010).\n86. See infra, III.B.3.\n87.

International Environmental Law\nThis subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence.\nScholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of \"noxious activity\" and prevention of \"information pollution.\"⁹⁵ The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the \"no harm\" principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas).⁹⁶ States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State.⁹⁷ In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed: \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory . . . to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another . . .\n⁹³.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of \"natural resources ... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the \"neighbouring State\" concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103\nWe dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State. A cyberattack can be directed from any distant location connected to the internet and traverse\n98. Trail Smelter (U.S. v. Can.), 3 R.I.A.A. 1905, 1950 (Mixed Claims Comm'n 1938, 1941).\n99.

Cyberspace, still in its infancy, has seemingly infinite resources.¹⁰⁹ Permanent cyberspace degradation is not an issue: servers can be restored after attacks and security breaches can be repaired. At worst, physical infrastructure and data destroyed in a cyberattack still would not affect the overall functioning of the cyberspace domain.\nStates have no impetus to restrict private actors from \"polluting\" cyberspace. The \"tragedy of the commons\" theory reasons that \"we are locked into a system of fouling our own nest\".¹¹⁰ This is because the cost of the waste \"[a person] discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying [her] wastes.\"¹¹¹ We do not foul the cyberspace \"nest\" because no amount of \"cyberwaste\" can (currently) overload and inhibit cyberspace functions. The medium fosters independent gain without fear of endangering the cyberspace platform.\nThe \"polluter pays\" principle should be applied to shift the duty of prevention onto private industry. (This should sit alongside States criminalising cyber-offences for individual liability.) As Alan Boyle suggests, \"it may be simpler, quicker, and economically more efficient to make polluters . . . pay rather than States.\"¹¹² State regulations should\n¹⁰⁵.

The \"cyber-polluter\" should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage. This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable.\nSecond, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks; and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure. The owners may outsource the task to \"threat intelligence\" companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals. Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry. As with cyber-diligence, \"cyber-pollution\" should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.\nDirecting a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for \"cyber-pollution\" incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability. Consumer perception of network owners' cyber vulnerability could result in reputational and stock-price hits. The\n45, entered into force May 30, 1996.\n121.

First, a private liability regime could dilute State responsibility, moving questions of cyber-diligence from public international law into private international law.¹²⁹ The principle risks “exonerating certain subjects of international law from their share of responsibility for damage” caused by cyberattacks.¹³⁰\nSecond, civil liability does “not always [guarantee] real compensation for the damage caused to the environment.”¹³¹ A compensation scheme does not rectify the damage already caused to networks. To counter this inadequacy, States ought to take positive steps to terminate cyberattacks that are in progress and mitigate injury as far as possible. They should also bear cooperation duties to help restore injured networks post-cyberattack.¹³²\nIn limited State practice, victim States readily initiate prosecution under domestic criminal laws after they ascertain a hacker’s identity. In 2007, cyberattacks targeted Estonia’s government websites, e-services, and information infrastructure after Estonia removed a Soviet-era memorial.¹³³ Attack methods included denial of service (“DOS”),¹³⁴\n¹²⁷.

Rather, despite its shortcomings, States should use the polluter pays principle to pressure industry to improve cybersecurity.

As is taken up later, cyberspace, unlike the high seas, is not a res communis. An analogy with the marine environment also impractically extends the scope of cyber-diligence obligations to nationals outside territorial control. But it provides guidance for an adequate regulatory framework in cyber-diligence.\n## D. International Law of the Sea\nPart XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"UNCLOS\") enshrines States' due diligence obligations within the marine environment. Article 192 establishes the general obligation to \"protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁴ Under Article 193, States enjoy the sovereign right to exploit natural resources, but must also take measures to prevent pollution to the marine environment.¹⁴⁵\nSeveral differences arise when applying due diligence obligations in the marine environment compared to cyberspace. First, due diligence obligations under UNCLOS do not exclusively attach to sovereignty.¹⁴⁶ Vessels may operate in areas where States enjoy mutual rights. Articles 192 and 193 oblige flag States to ensure conservation of living resources, including in the exclusive economic zones of other States.¹⁴⁷ To discharge this obligation, flag States ought to ensure vessels within their jurisdiction and control \"do not undermine [their] obligations . . . to protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁸ The arbitral\n¹⁴⁴.

A State’s cyber-diligence obligation should not extend to terminating a cyberattack initiated by a national abroad.¹⁵² In the sea, a flag vessel’s physical location is identifiable. A State’s due diligence obligation follows their flag vessels’ chartered territory. In cyberspace, a State exercises authority over infrastructure within their exclusive control both in their territory and extraterritorially.¹⁵³ But a State’s jurisdictional control of their nationals assumes different characteristics. The operations of transnational non-State actors (and their data trails) are often borderless, simultaneously residing in multiple jurisdictions.¹⁵⁴\n¹⁴⁹.

For State A to terminate the cyberattacks, it needs to access networks in States C and D (constituting prohibited interference, $^{155}$  unless States C and D grant consent). In this situation, besides a duty of cooperation to assist a victim State's investigations of their national, State A should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation to terminate the cyberattack.\nSeparately, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea's (\"ITLOS\") Seabed Disputes Advisory Opinion articulates internal laws and regulations which States ought to adopt to fulfil due diligence obligations. UNCLOS places due diligence obligations on States who engage contractors for projects within international waters (sponsoring States). Sponsoring States are required to \"[adopt] laws\n155.

See infra, III.C.\n216\nLiu\n|  Extracted Principles | Cyber-Diligence Application  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (1) To fulfil due diligence obligations, sponsoring States must enact laws, regulations, and administrative measures enforcing the obligations of contractors.1 Contractual arrangements are insufficient.2 | Territorial States should: (1) criminalise cyberattacks causing serious injury in foreign territory and; (2) incentivise network owners to secure infrastructure.  |\n|  (2) “[The obligations] may include [establishing] enforcement mechanisms for active supervision of the activities of the sponsored contractor.”3 | States should:○ In grants and tenders, prioritise corporations with clean “track records” or those diligently securing their networks. These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases.  |\n|  (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity.  |\nLiu\nThese measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State,¹⁶¹ and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity.\nCyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured.\nInternational cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked.\n## E. An Assessment of International Cooperation in Cyberspace¹⁶²\nCurrently, two trends in cybersecurity cooperation can be observed:\n1. States engage in multilateral cooperation efforts within regional or political alliances.¹⁶³\n2.

For example, a bilateral agreement between Russia and Estonia enshrined “obligations” to transfer evidence, assist in investigations, and extradite alleged perpetrators of criminal offences.¹⁶⁹ In spite of this, Russia refused to assist Estonia’s investigations after the 2007 cyberattacks. Russia’s interpretation of the treaty excluded surveillance measures identifying a perpetrator’s physical location.¹⁷⁰ A restrictive interpretation conceals, perhaps, a lack of cooperative will.¹⁷¹ Some States possibly favour a poorly regulated cyberspace.¹⁷² States can leverage assistance to gain traction with allies, or refuse\nTY PLANNING (2016), http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Security-Planning/; EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY, EUROPEAN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENCE (EP3R) (2009) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies; German Federal Office for Information Security, IT-Grundschutz (2016), https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/; Shackleford, supra note 20, at 29.\n¹⁶⁵.

Conversely, States may not seek or provide assistance for fear of exposing their cyber vulnerabilities or cyber-technology.\nCooperative duties nonetheless need to be \"clear, useful, and doable.\" To complement current regimes, they ought to immediately contain a cyberattack. States should commission cybersecurity experts, and:\n1. deploy their experts to secure critical (and vulnerable) networks domestically, reducing the risk of cyberattacks emanating from their territory; and\n2. in the event of an ongoing cyberattack, mobilize these experts in real-time to instantly upgrade network security.\nExperts could be exchanged between contracting agencies within cooperating States. Each State could mobilize experts from multiple jurisdictions if cyberattacks occurred or if their private sector demanded increased protection. States with cyber-monitoring capabilities may warn others, in advance, of increased malicious traffic indicating imminent cyberattack(s). A target State can then boost network capacity in anticipation. In ongoing cyberattacks, assisting States may host servers, transfer bandwidth, and eliminate botnet traffic.\nBut these suggestions remain aspirational. First, duties to co-operate are obligations of conduct \"formulated in a relatively weak way,\" which do not drive outcomes.

Prevention of Transnational Terrorism\n## 1. Introduction\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks share parallels. The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed.²⁰² We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\"²⁰³ A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.²⁰⁴\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats.²⁰⁵ These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law.²⁰⁶ They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory.²⁰⁷ Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n²⁰² Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear . . . to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.”²⁰⁸ A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.²⁰⁹\n## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison\nInternational law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network”²¹⁰ without a formal hierarchy.²¹¹ Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”.²¹² Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.²¹³\nAnonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.”²¹⁴ The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream,\n208. *Id.* at 114.\n209.

Its \"ops\" begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to \"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling \"anons\" into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites.²¹⁶ In 2012, \"anons\" initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline. \"Operation Anti-ACTA\" responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.²¹⁷ Anonymous proclaimed that the agreement \"[enslaves] the internet.\"²¹⁸ While the government website was down, Polish politicians opposed to the agreement wore Guy Fawkes masks (the symbol of the Anonymous movement) in Parliament.²¹⁹\nPrivate actors domiciled across different States accomplish Al-Qaeda and Anonymous' \"successes\". They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.\n215. D.C.

The obligation existed within custom and conventions well before 9/11.²²⁰ However, this paper focuses on the counter-terrorism standard of due diligence established within Resolution 1373.\nIn handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.”²²¹ States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.”²²² The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.²²³\nResolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations.²²⁴ States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation).²²⁵ These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security,²²⁶ which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.²²⁷\n²²⁰.

First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks.\n## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision\nResolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures.²³⁰ The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies,²³¹ and does not enforce sanctions on those who \"fail\" to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment.\nThe U.N. General Assembly has established the Group of Governmental Experts in Information Security (\"G.G.E.\"), signalling an intention to centralise cybersecurity efforts.²³² The Group outlines\nInternational Terrorism, in Bianchi &amp; Naqvi eds, supra note 26, at 83-92; see also SUNSTEIN, supra note 85, at 123.\n228.

The C.D.C's overall goal should be to assist (particularly developing) States building capacity to prevent cyberattacks. A gradual improvement in capacity throughout all 191 U.N. member States could decrease the frequency of cyberattacks, although this will take time, and requires ample financial resources.²³⁵\nThe C.D.C's specific functions should resemble those of the C.T.C.: appoint experts to advise States on cyber-diligence compliance,²³⁶ coordinate assistance between donors and donees,²³⁷ and elicit compulsory written reports on States' capacity building measures. A C.D.C. reduces the discretion of States to determine appropriate measures for cyber-diligence. Through reviews, the C.D.C. should implicitly set a due diligence standard for States to meet in acquiring capacity. A C.D.C. should stress the relative nature of cyber-diligence and not stretch the obligation into one of absolute prevention.²³⁸ (It should centralize responsibility for co-ordinating cyber-diligence efforts, but preserve due diligence as an obligation of conduct.)\n233.

It risks creating a disparity between States' reported capacity and their actual exercise of that capacity.²³⁹ Unresolved tensions include:\n1. whether the C.D.C. should impose effective enforcement mechanisms, or respect State decisions on internal social, economic, and political matters;²⁴⁰ and\n2. how the C.D.C. should determine which States: (i) do not have a genuine capacity to acquire or execute cyber-diligence (unable but willing), and; which States (ii) have the capacity (in reality) to exercise cyber-diligence, but decline to do so (able but unwilling).²⁴¹\nIn the counter-terrorism context, Tal Becker proposes that due diligence standards should apply to a State:\n1. acquiring the (legal, administrative, and resource) capacity to meet their due diligence obligations, and;\n2. “[employing] its capabilities with due diligence”.²⁴²\nBecker’s proposed standards should be incorporated into States’ cyber-diligence obligations. The C.D.C. should supervise States’ compliance with limb (1). States who fail to notify the C.D.C. of their capacity deficits should be disentitled from pleading a lack of capacity if a subsequent cyberattack implicates their networks.²⁴³ This approach limits the responsibility of unable but willing States for a particular cyberattack, provided they have fulfilled limb (1) to the extent of their capacity. Other domestic exigencies may militate against\n²³⁹. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128.\n²⁴⁰. U.N. Charter art. 2(7).\n²⁴¹.

However, difficulties arise where *able but unwilling* States exercise cyber-diligence “half-heartedly”. For instance, a State could neutralise a third of the total botnets emanating from their territory (when they have the capacity to terminate the entire cyberattack).²⁴⁵ To establish violation, the victim State ought to prove that the territorial State did not employ their full capacity to prevent the cyberattack.²⁴⁶\nThere is no “quick fix” to these tensions. Nonetheless, a C.D.C. should introduce an internationally calibrated strategy to capacity building in cyber-diligence. Far from being merely theoretical, 159 States have received counter-terrorism assistance as a result of the C.T.C.²⁴⁷ A C.D.C. realises the UN’s role of equipping States with the *capacity for* cyber-diligence,²⁴⁸ but not overstepping its intergovernmental character to intervene in States’ actual exercise of cyber-diligence.²⁴⁹\nThis section argues that the contents of a State’s cyber-diligence obligation should include: (1) the “cyber-polluter pays” principle; (2) implementing regulations for industry to secure infrastructure, and; (3) capacity-building via consultation with the C.D.C. But States ought to know what circumstances enliven their obligation to fulfil these contents. The following section considers the two key triggers of cyber-diligence obligations: knowledge and injury.\n244. TRAPP, *supra* note 63, at 79.\n245.

Does Actual or Constructive Knowledge Trigger Cyber-Diligence?\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, a sovereign's responsibility for their subjects' actions consists of \"forbearance\" and \"protection shewn to transgressions.\"²⁵⁰ The sovereign must: (1) know of the transgression and; (2) fail to prevent or punish the delinquency.\nKnowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility.²⁵¹ States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it.²⁵² Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury.²⁵³ There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion.²⁵⁴ A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.²⁵⁵\nThis paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:\n250.

A botnet is \"a network of compromised computers.\" \"The bots\" are remotely controlled by the \"botherder\" and conduct coordinated cyber operations. There is no limit on the number of bots that can be \"recruited\". See Schmitt ed., supra note 25, at 257; COMMITTEE ON OFFENSIVE INFORMATION WARFARE, supra note 25, at 89.\n254. But see, infra IV.3.b.\n255. Unless the state itself launched the cyberattack, a fact that is exceedingly difficult to prove.\n232\nLiu\n1. Actual knowledge: a State knows of a cyberattack (where a State organ conducts the cyberattack);\n2. Conniance: a State wilfully shuts their eyes to the obvious occurrence of a cyberattack (for example, after detecting the cyberattack or being notified of it);²⁵⁶\n3. Objective evidence leads to a logical conclusion that:\n- a State ought to have known of a cyberattack, or;\n- a State had information on a cyberattack, and was obliged to undertake further inquiries, but failed to do so;\n4. In the event a C.D.C. is adopted, States bear a heightened duty of vigilance to identify and eliminate threats within their territory.²⁵⁷ Constructive knowledge and an obligation to undertake further inquiries are built into this duty.\nCategories (1) – (2) constitute subjective knowledge, while categories (3) – (4) amount to constructive (objective) knowledge. First, we demonstrate that all four categories should suffice to trigger cyber-diligence. Second, we suggest an appropriate standard of proof to establish a territorial State’s knowledge before an international court or tribunal (“international tribunal”).\n## 1. Subjective Knowledge is Difficult to Establish\n### i. Categories 1 and 2\nSubjective knowledge is the highest degree of intent. A State either intended the cyberattack to cause serious injury, or endorsed the outcome. In judicial proceedings, victim States may struggle to establish a territorial State’s actual knowledge or connivance. The accused State’s sovereignty shrouds any evidence of subjective knowledge in secrecy. It is unthinkable that an accused State would surrender documents\n²⁵⁶.

Iran was \"fully aware . . . of the urgent need for action,\"²⁶⁰ given \"repeated calls for help\" to the Iranian Foreign Ministry.²⁶¹ Iran's inaction was \"due to more than mere negligence or lack of appropriate means.\"²⁶²\nHowever, victim States rarely notify territorial States of a cyberattack. Notification consumes time, does little to reduce injury, and tarnishes inter-State relations. Instead, a State will likely devote their resources to withstanding a cyberattack. In the Estonian incident, botnet infiltrations implicated computers in 178 countries.²⁶³ Estonia did not notify one territorial State. Instead, Estonia increased bandwidth capacity (so networks could handle increased traffic), filtered malicious transmissions, and engaged U.S. and N.A.T.O. assistance to terminate sources of the attack.²⁶⁴ Some territorial States voluntarily neutralized sources of attacks.²⁶⁵\nIn 2008, Georgia and Russia engaged in armed conflict over the South Ossetia region. Georgia suffered concurrent cyberattacks on their governmental, commercial and media networks, (supposedly) coordinated via Russian infrastructure.²⁶⁶ Georgia, a \"cyber-locked\" State, relied on neighbouring States' cyber infrastructure to facilitate\n258.

Victim States mitigate loss and boost defences when a cyberattack begins. Politically allied States disable attack sources and offer relief networks.²⁷² Victim States do not benefit from notification.\nThe knowledge threshold to trigger cyber-diligence should be lowered. Kimberley Trapp argues (in the counter-terrorism context): \"requiring proof of subjective knowledge would effectively act as a bar to any finding of responsibility for a failure to prevent.\"²⁷³ A territorial State's cyber-diligence obligation should be triggered if they \"ought to have known\" of a cyberattack.\n## 2. Constructive Knowledge Should Trigger Cyber-Diligence Obligations\n### i. Category 3\nInternational jurisprudence supports constructive knowledge triggering due diligence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J's majority judgment relied on a series of inferences to conclude that the minefield laying \"could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of Albania.\"²⁷⁴ The majority inferred Albania's knowledge according to objective standards.\n²⁶⁷.

Indications of government infrastructure's involvement in a cyberattack can be deceiving. First, non-State hackers may compromise a government server.284 A cyberattack being mounted from government infrastructure does not in itself establish responsibility in the cyber context.285\nSecond, cyberattacks are often dressed with \"spoofing\" (identify manipulation) techniques. In the Estonian incident, spoofing clouded evidence which incriminated Moscow's exclusive infrastructure: unknown perpetrators could have adopted the veil of a Moscow government computer.286 Often, \"onion routing\" techniques are used to conceal perpetrators' identity.287 The majority of cyberattacks use such masquerading tactics.288 Even if network logs suggest a cyberattack exploited government infrastructure, the victim State should still be bound to adduce evidence to dismiss spoofing concerns.\nSome commentators stretch the presumption of constructive knowledge further. They advocate a reverse presumptio juris whenever a cyberattack is associated with government infrastructure,289 or when \"injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State.\"290 International tribunals would shift the burden of proof onto the territorial State, who must disprove their presumed constructive knowledge.291\n283.

Territorial control does not “[shift] the burden of proof . . . in relation to unlawful acts perpetrated therein.”²⁹³ In Pulp Mills, the I.C.J. stated “a preventive approach . . . does not [operate] as a reversal of the burden of proof.”²⁹⁴ It is not for the territorial State to prove its diligence. State control over governmental networks only gives rise to “abstract and immaterial knowledge” of a cyberattack, insufficient to presume State responsibility.²⁹⁵\nBut victim States may use the accused State's control over government infrastructure as evidence. Section IV.A.3. explains how a pattern of such evidence should establish constructive knowledge. But first, we examine how constructive knowledge would operate under category 4.\n## ii. Category 4\nWith reference to Section III.F.3., should a C.D.C. framework be established, a degree of constructive knowledge should be presumed. Territorial States would be held to a standard of vigilance in maintaining their cyber-territory, and constructive knowledge of an ongoing or imminent attack would be imputed to these States. States would have less latitude to plead a lack of capacity to discover a particular cyberattack.\nPresuming knowledge would reflect heightened expectations for State compliance with cyber-diligence obligations.²⁹⁶ The victim State still bears the burden of proof²⁹⁷ and should establish knowledge\n292.

Overcoming the Evidentiary Hurdle: Standard of Proof\nTypically, a failure in due diligence will be raised after the victim State (“applicant”) suffers injury. The issue turns to causation. How does the applicant gather sufficient evidence to establish that actual or constructive knowledge triggered the territorial State’s (“respondent”) cyber-diligence obligation?²⁹⁸ The applicant will struggle to establish their case absent the respondent’s assistance or at least consent to evidence collection.²⁹⁹\nThe I.C.J. acknowledges that victim States face evidentiary difficulties, allowing a “more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence . . . provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.”³⁰⁰ But the standard of proof in an international tribunal should not be lowered “simply because it is . . . difficult to reach.”³⁰¹ The standard “[protects] the respondent against false attribution . . . a particularly serious risk in the cyber context.”³⁰²\nThe applicant must produce reliable and neutral evidence to establish that the respondent at least ought to have known of the cyberattack.³⁰³ They could rely on experts to adduce logs of the respondent’s network behaviour during the cyberattack.³⁰⁴ An international tribunal may\nOF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE: A COMMENTARY 1245 (Andreas Zimmermann et al. eds, 2012).\n298.

As Durward Sandifer argues: “in dealing with sovereign States . . . it cannot lightly be presumed that one of the parties to the litigation is guilty of negligence.”³¹⁰ Doing so may result in evidence of low probative value establishing a breach of due diligence, which would undercut the presumption that States observe international law.³¹¹ Conversely, the standard of proof should not be so “unduly exacting” that it becomes impossible to meet.³¹²\nRep. 2014 (Mar. 31), p. 226, 237 paras 18-20, 255-57 paras 73-82, 283 paras 188-90, 290-93 paras 217-227; The South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of Philippines v.

It also incentivizes States to secure (at least) their governmental infrastructure. But the approach does not prejudice States who lack the capacity to safeguard their governmental infrastructure.³²⁰\nQuestions of a State's actual or constructive knowledge are contingent on a judicial forum's evidentiary standards. Together, they form the \"knowledge\" element to trigger cyber-diligence obligations. A threshold of constructive knowledge proven to a clear and convincing standard has been advanced. This paper now turns to the second trigger-element: injury.\n## B. What Level of Injury Engages A Cyber-Diligence Duty?\nInjury is not a pre-requisite to finding an internationally wrongful act under the laws of State responsibility.³²¹ Once a breach is attributed to a State, responsibility is potentially engaged, subject to application of the primary rule.³²² In the context of due diligence, however, damage is a condition to finding a violation of the primary rule.³²³ A State who failed to exercise cyber-diligence is only liable for breaching the primary rule after hostile acts, contrary to another State's legal rights, occur.³²⁴ When \"due diligence is violated, there is an attribution to the State . . . of the consequences of the acts of [private] persons.\"³²⁵\n³²⁰.

Cyber-diligence obligations \"re-establish the status quo erat.\"³²⁹ With that in mind, this section defines \"serious injury\" to trigger States' cyber-diligence obligations.\nThe Tallinn Manual defines an \"unlawful [cyber] act\" as \"all cyber activities from one State's territory that affect the rights of other States [producing] a negative effect.\"³³⁰ The definition covers any operation affecting \"sovereignty\": a lower level of injury compared to an act of interference³³¹ or armed force.³³²\nHowever, when is \"a negative effect\" of sufficient gravity to trigger cyber-diligence? Jurisprudence and the literature establish a context-dependent standard of serious injury. In *Trail Smelter*, the arbitral tribunal stated \"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury . . . when the case is of serious consequence.\"³³³ Some commentators state that \"serious injury\" triggers the duty, without further explanation.³³⁴ The Tallinn Manual ambiguously concludes that \"physical damage to objects or injuries to\n³²⁶.

The concept does not define what measures a State should take during the occurrence of the injury. In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.³³⁶\nThis paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories.³³⁷ We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation. The types of injury listed are non-exhaustive, but represent differing levels of severity.\n## 1. Injury to Persons or Loss of Life; Physical Damage or Destruction of Objects\nCyberattacks which cause physical damage equivalent to conventional attacks could constitute armed force or armed attack (when launched by a State).³³⁸ While discussions of *jus ad bellum* are beyond this paper’s scope, several observations should be made.\nFirst, category 1 represents cyberattack injury of the highest severity. Any physical harm to persons or objects would trigger a territorial State’s cyber-diligence obligation.³³⁹ But it is very rare for a cyberattack to cause category 1 damage.

Some argue that attacks on critical national infrastructure (such as water supply and electricity grids) would likely lead to secondary consequences of physical injury to persons and objects.³⁴⁰ An attack on one critical network has a “synergistic effect,”³⁴¹ propagating injury to other connected physical infrastructures.\nSuch conclusions need to be balanced. The scale and duration of a cyberattack and the effectiveness of the target State’s response determines the likelihood of category 1 injuries. In 2015, for the first time, a cyberattack struck an electricity grid, in Ukraine. The attackers hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) systems in seven substations,³⁴² disconnecting power to 225,000 Ukrainians for three hours. Some had anticipated an “electronic Pearl Harbour” once a cyberattack hits an electric grid.³⁴³ This did not occur. The Ukrainian energy providers shifted to manual operations and restored electricity quickly. No physical damage to infrastructure occurred.³⁴⁴\nSecond, as yet, only State organs are equipped and motivated to inflict material injury using cyber-offensive capabilities.³⁴⁵ Such a cyberattack would automatically be considered an act of the State.³⁴⁶ Liability turns on attribution and the breach of an international\n340.

A State may forego invoking intermediary cyber-diligence breaches if the injury is serious, preferring to treat it instead as armed force or armed attack so as to enliven jus ad bellum. Non-State hacktivists rarely (if ever) cause physical injury. Hackers instead inundate networks with DDOS attacks or implant malware and extract information.\nThird, no reported cyberattack has yet caused injury to persons or loss of life. Some have come close: hackers infiltrated a hospital network and lethally altered a patient's dosages, only to be discovered by a nurse before the drug was administered. Debate exists about whether the 2010 Stuxnet virus actually caused physical damage to Iranian centrifuges. Stuxnet took control of SCADA networks, manipulated data and controlled the processing speed of centrifuges. One commentator argues that the injury suffered was a mere usurpation of the SCADA networks and not injury to the physical integrity of the centrifuges. Apart from Stuxnet, to date, we have been unable to identify a single cyberattack which has caused physical damage to a network's physical components and not merely destroying data or incapacitating network functions.\nCyberattacks overloaded and temporarily suspended networks in the Estonian and Georgian incidents.

A rigid requirement of physical damage or destruction (perhaps more suited to conventional attacks) $^{354}$  is inappropriate for cyber-diligence. The cyber-diligence obligation prevents injury to cyber networks and infrastructure. A lower level of damage should also trigger cyber-diligence. One commentator notes: \"the dependency of modern societies on [computer] networks has made it possible to incapacitate physical infrastructures without destroying them.\" $^{355}$\n# 2. Loss of Network Functionality $^{356}$\nMost cyberattack methods disrupt target networks. Cyberattacks could overwhelm a network with botnet requests, cause system malfunction, or otherwise degrade the quality of network services. Herbert Lin distinguishes between a (destructive) \"cyberattack\" and a (non-destructive) \"cyber-exploitation\". The former renders a network unavailable, or undermines the network's integrity, without destroying any physical components. For instance, DDOS attacks on Estonian infrastructure temporarily reduced accessibility to crucial services in the financial, telecommunications, media, and government sectors. The attack significantly hindered the ability to conduct financial transactions, resulting in losses to industry and Estonian citizens.\nThis paper argues that once a cyberattack causes serious disruptions to a network's proper functioning, the cyberattack is then \"destructive\",\n354.

Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries.\nSecondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack.³⁶⁷ The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm.³⁶⁸ Due diligence standards change according to “new scientific or technological knowledge [and] risks involved in the activity.”³⁶⁹ Primary injury to\n362.

States should be obligated, with reference to the primary infrastructure affected, to take proportionate action to prevent or reduce secondary injuries (to the extent possible).³⁷¹\n## 3. Cyber-Exploitations\nThe third category of \"injury\" results from stealthily executed cyber activities, unknown the victim. \"Cyber-exploitation\" describes an activity intended to clandestinely access and exploit a network's vulnerabilities without disturbing the network's operation.³⁷² Intelligence gathering operations most frequently cause this \"injury\".³⁷³ Hackers emplace malware into a network to collect information for economic or political purposes. Cyber-exploitations could also probe a network for vulnerabilities in preparation for future cyberattacks.³⁷⁴\nThe term \"injury\" is hesitantly used to refer to category (3). It is unclear what injury cyber-exploitation actually causes to a victim State. \"[An] infringement of rights or legally protected interests\" activates cyber-diligence obligations.³⁷⁵ The question turns on whether peacetime cyber-exploitation infringes a target State's territorial sovereignty.³⁷⁶\nArguably, covert cyber-exploitations which intrude on a network and extract data violate the \"honor, dignity or prestige of a State\"³⁷⁷\n370.

The (initially) non-destructive operation can mature, in real time, into a destructive cyberattack.\nSuccessful cyber-exploitation, which operates within a network, normally goes unnoticed.³⁸⁶ Cyber-diligence cannot be triggered without sufficient knowledge and should only be triggered when destructive effects materialise.\n## 4. Cyber-Vandalism, Irritation and Computer Crime\nThe Tallinn Manual regards \"mere irritation or inconvenience\" as not of sufficient seriousness to trigger cyber-diligence.³⁸⁷ Low-intensity cyber-vandalism does not cause serious disruption to a State and is appropriately classified as a domestic cybercrime under the Budapest Convention.³⁸⁸ 85% to 97% of all cybercrimes are not revealed let alone prosecuted.³⁸⁹ Such laxity in enforcement demonstrates States' passive tolerance of low-intensity cybercrimes.³⁹⁰ To counter \"close to unlimited\" instances of cyber-vandalism,³⁹¹ States should improve domestic cybercrime regulation and dedicate cyber-diligence resources to preventing higher categories of injury.\nMarco Roscini argues that defacement alters computer data and should be characterized as a disruptive cyberattack (category 2\n385.

But unlike “destructive” cyberattacks, defacement merely causes superficial injuries to a network. Hacktivists intend to transmit unwanted political messages, not to overthrow a regime.³⁹⁴ *Oppenheim’s International Law* notes that due diligence obligations do not extend to “suppress[ing] criticism of, or propaganda directed against, other States or governments on the part of private persons.”³⁹⁵ Roscini himself recognizes that defacement is “relatively innocuous [and] psychological.”³⁹⁶ Cyber-diligence should not “imply an obligation to suppress all such conduct [inimical to] the regime or policy of a foreign State.”³⁹⁷\nDespite the difficulties of retrospectively evaluating “serious injury”, this threshold reflects States’ concerns about cyberattacks which disable infrastructural operations. Under our formulation, cyber-exploitation and defacement fall below the threshold. States would likely avoid burdensome cyber-diligence for cyber activity of low-intensity, largely tolerated internationally.\nThe final section outlines hypothetical cyberattack scenarios and explores whether best-practice exchanges could set an implicit standard of cyber-diligence.\n392.

ASSESSING BREACH OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\nThe preceding sections define the contents and triggers of cyber-diligence obligations. This paper now discusses violation of the primary obligation.\nBreach of the primary obligation fastens on a State's knowledge, capacity to prevent, and the level of injury caused. Pierre-Marie Dupuy states: \"the true breach of an obligation of conduct is the breach of an obligation to behave (in a legally defined way).\"³⁹⁸ The accusing State needs to establish that they would not have suffered injury, or would have suffered less injury, if the accused State exercised cyber-diligence. Injury is not the decisive element. Breach is evaluated according to whether, at the origin of the injury, a State failed to do all it could to prevent the end result.³⁹⁹ As soon as a territorial State does not take all appropriate measures to stop a cyberattack, the cyber-diligence obligation has been violated.⁴⁰⁰\nThe obligation, articulated in theory, does not capture the infinite scenarios which may arise in practice, including when:⁴⁰¹\n1. A lesser-able State puts their limited capacity to diligent use, doing all they can to stop a cyberattack.\n2. A State has sound cyber-capabilities in general, but is \"resource-poor\" at the time of the cyberattack. The State may have allocated intense resources to other priorities and is unable to terminate the cyberattack.\n3. A State with sound cyber-capabilities, both generally and at the time of a cyberattack, decides not to terminate the cyberattack.\n³⁹⁸. Dupuy, supra note 69, at 379.\n³⁹⁹.

BECKER, supra note 202, at 151-52.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n253\nLiu\nThese situations are highly abstract and all presuppose that a State has requisite knowledge and that the cyberattack causes serious injury. Variable factors across these situations determine breach. Assessment of breach ought to be “realistic and context-sensitive,”⁴⁰² particularized to the circumstances in question. Theoretically, the State in situation (1) has exercised cyber-diligence to the extent of their capabilities, satisfying the obligation. The State in situation (3) has, by contrast, failed to do all it could to stop the cyberattack, and breaches their obligation. Situation (2) is less clear: international law does not dictate States’ domestic resource-allocation.⁴⁰³\nIn reality, establishing responsibility is not straightforward. To evade responsibility, an accused State could claim:\n1. they exercised their best efforts, yet still failed to achieve a result in the face of new cyberattack methods;\n2. a lack of capacity at the time of a cyberattack, given other exigencies;⁴⁰⁴ or\n3. they lacked sufficient knowledge of the cyberattacks.\nThe accusing State then bears the unenviable burden of establishing breach.\nPredicting a breach of cyber-diligence with confidence is difficult. First, there is no minimum standard of cyber-diligence to measure compliance against.⁴⁰⁵ Second, a State’s acquiescence to a cyberattack is also likely to be covert and publicly denied.⁴⁰⁶ Third, cyber-diligence is a “moveable target”, constantly evolving as cyberspace technology develops.⁴⁰⁷\n402.

S.C. Resolution 1377 invited the C.T.C. to promote counter-terrorism best-practice and prepare model laws.⁴¹⁰ A C.D.C. could do the same, and implicitly define an expected standard of care for cyber-diligence between member States.\nBest Management Practices (\"BMPs\") in counter-piracy provide a useful example of the best-practices approach to solving problems. Devised by the International Marine Organisation and the shipping industry, the BMPs increased vessels' successful resistance to piracy by 25%.⁴¹¹ Adopting these self-help recommendations (including such matters as speed, security equipment, and watchkeeping) were in the vessels' best interests. Compliance minimized insurance premiums and decreased the probability of pirate capture.⁴¹²\nThere is no guarantee that adopting and disseminating best-practice will achieve these results for cyber-diligence. Cyber-powers or private industries must be willing to share their (actual) best-practices before any dialogue improves cyber-diligence capabilities. Private industry could monetise cyberattack prevention capabilities and offer their services to the highest bidder.

It remains unclear whether best-practice compliance will become attractive to States.\n# VI. CONCLUSIONS\nOur world is increasingly digital. Cyber-infrastructure now underpins many of the essential features of a modern society. Cyberspace pervades our lives and the dangers of its ill-use are publicly recognized. Citizens reap the benefits of cyber-technology, at the same time expecting governments to shield them from transnational cyber-threats.⁴¹⁹\nOn interconnected threats, the U.N. Secretary General has remarked: “we must found a new security consensus, the first article of which must be that . . . whatever threatens one threatens all.”⁴²⁰ Indeed, cyber-technology disregards political and cultural borders and grants unlimited reach to private actors. But there is no need to panic.\n415. Jason Fritz, *How China will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness*, 8 CULT. MANDALA 28 (2008).\n416. Czosseck, *supra* note 9, at 16.\n417.

It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an \"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\" of serious consequences from a cyberattack.⁴²² Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example.⁴²³ Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects. \"Serious attacks\" affecting network functionality are few and far between. But the Estonian and Georgian incidents demonstrate that they can occur.\nAt a minimum, to establish breaches of cyber-diligence, the victim\n⁴²¹. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 226.\n⁴²². Id. at 39; SUNSTEIN, supra note 80, at 120.\n⁴²³. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 45.\nLiu\nState must produce clear and convincing evidence:\n1. of the territorial State's constructive knowledge, and;\n2. that the cyberattack caused category (1) (physical destruction) or category 2 (incapacitation) injury to objects or subjects within their territory.\nThe above elements establish a cyber-diligence framework. It is hoped that the framework matches States' concerns in practice and can guide their cybersecurity policies. Beijing and Washington, from our opening example, should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation in relation to defacement of each other's websites. Even if constructive knowledge can be established, the hacktivism did not cause injury of the requisite threshold to trigger the obligation.\nCyber-diligence will continue to be debated within academia before States employ relevant measures. It is hoped that this paper contributes a balanced response to the present scholarship.\nIV Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 191-260 (April 2017)\n258\nLiu\n# Footnotes from table in section III.D.\n1.

Live trackers record over 6 million cyberattacks daily. Information technology-dependent societies increasingly perceive cyber-threats as a destabilising force and citizens inevitably look to the State for protection. This paper concerns one form of State protection: whether States owe due diligence obligations in cyberspace under the laws of State responsibility. Specifically, it re-examines the contents of such an obligation and the circumstances which could trigger it in light of cyberattacks' peculiarities. A straightforward replication of due diligence models from international environmental law or law of the sea is not appropriate. But cyber-diligence should incorporate certain principles found within both models and channel ultimate responsibility for securing cyber-infrastructure onto private industry. Counter-terrorism obligations are the most useful body of law in which to seek an analogy. This paper argues that a State's cyber-diligence obligation is triggered, at a minimum, by: (1) constructive knowledge of a cyberattack, (2) which causes serious injury to an operating network. These contents and triggers define a cyber-diligence framework. Public pressure on the State and the market to intensify responses to transnational cyber-threats will drive the adoption of such principles.\nKeywords: Information Technology Law, Non-State Actors, Cyber War, National Security, Internet Governance.\nThis paper was initially written in partial fulfilment of my LLB at Monash University.

CASE STUDY: “PATRIOTIC” HACKTIVISTS¹ In April 2001, a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet collide over the South China Sea. The Chinese F-8 crashes, killing its pilot. Meanwhile, the U.S. plane makes an emergency landing on Hainan Island. China detains twenty-four U.S. crew members for eleven days in a military base.² A Sino-U.S. “cyber-war” commences.³ U.S. hackers retaliate against the crew’s detention, defacing Chinese websites with messages including: “first you China men try and take our plane and crew... what is next? Our home land? Our freedom?”⁴ In response, “patriotic” Chinese hacktivists strike back. In a self-branded “cyber-operation defending our country,”⁵ hacktivists deface U.S. “.gov” and “.com” websites,⁶ leaving messages, including: “long live Chinese nationality!”⁷ Notably, the hacktivists on both sides were private actors, who rationalized their actions as legitimate patriotic demonstrations.⁸ This fact has led some to speculate that the Chinese government’s information warfare strategy includes “sponsoring” Chinese hacktivists.⁹ The terminology Liu of\"sponsoring\"implies a form of state responsibility and insinuates that hacktivism may be attributed to China under the relevant tests in general international law.¹⁰ But attribution is only one possible test of State responsibility.\nWhat is a State's responsibility for its own actions or inaction during these cyberattacks?¹¹ A due diligence obligation in cyberspace¹² (\"cyber-diligence\"), if established, would offer victim States alternative legal recourse for a territorial State's breach of a primary obligation.¹³ Subject to the contents and triggers of the obligation defined below, China and the U.S. could invoke one another's responsibility for failing to prevent hacktivism within their territories.¹⁴ The failure could constitute an internationally wrongful act, which would then enable either State to seek reparations.¹⁵ The present paper uses hacktivism as its opening case study to canvass the issue of State responsibility in cyberattacks. We now turn to examine, starting from first principles, the merits of including a cyber-diligence obligation as part of the State responsibility framework.\n\n# A. Introduction\nCyberspace has “developed from [networks] of academic researchers into a mainstream communications mechanism.”¹⁶ Unfortunately, enhanced information flow results in the medium’s misuse. States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction.\nMany States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure.¹⁷ Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements.¹⁸ “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence”¹⁹ all work against custom crystallizing.²⁰ Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity\n\ncollaboration. Obliging each State to take all available measures to stop cyberattacks which emanate from their territories would improve the security of interconnected networks globally.²¹ Arguably, to date, no cyberattack has risen to the level of a use of force. Aggrieved States have not invoked State responsibility for a failure to prevent injurious cyberattacks. Yet, live trackers record over six million cyberattacks daily,²² and fear of cyber insecurity has gripped the world.²³ States increasingly invest in cyber capabilities to protect against escalations in cyberattack severity,²⁴ with cyberspace militarisation widely forecasted.²⁵ Some commentators opine that cyber weapons are the next “weapon of choice” for terrorism.²⁶ This kind of event could propel a global uptake and strict application of cyber-diligence. This paper evaluates the cyber-diligence discourse Liu in advance of such an event.²⁷ It aims to comprehensively define the contents and triggers of a cyber-diligence obligation, and offer reasoned conclusions which States could implement in practice. The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void.\nThe present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to\"peacetime\"cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack.²⁸ These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers.²⁹ Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State.\nFirst, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty. Cyber-diligence should be classified as an obligation of conduct. As the International Court of Justice (\"I.C.J.\") states:\"the obligation of States [is] to [employ] all means reasonably available to them\"³⁰ to prevent injurious activity. But a State does not incur responsibility “because the desired result is not achieved.”³¹ Second, we define the content of States’ cyber-diligence obligations, which should be distinct from due diligence obligations in environmental law.³² However, States should implement the polluter pays principle. Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts.\nThird, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network.\nFourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation. An objective standard of due diligence, defined through best-practice exchanges, could provide a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of States’ compliance.³³ But many States may not be ³¹ Id.; James Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N.

States also have different capabilities to intervene in cyberspace. As a result, their capacity should limit their responsibility.³⁴ Cyberattacks transcend exclusive territorial control.³⁵ But the threat does not necessitate a reinvention of international law.³⁶ The proposed cyber-diligence framework preserves State-centric responsibility in cyberspace,³⁷ extending post-Westphalian sovereignty to a relatively Hobbesian environment (which is barely 20 years old).³⁸ The author is hopeful that the present paper can contribute to international law as a project of imposing and maintaining “order through words, whether at sea or on land... or indeed in cyberspace.”³⁹\n\n# II. THE PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF DUE DILIGENCE IN STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## A. Due Diligence derives from Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace⁴⁰\nDue diligence is a corollary of States’ equal sovereignty.⁴¹ States enjoy plenary jurisdiction to control objects and subjects within their territory,⁴² but must also “respect . . . the territorial sovereignty and political integrity” of others.⁴³ Flowing from States’ reciprocal respect, the I.C.J. famously articulated the due diligence obligation: “it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴ Due diligence, accordingly, has developed into a general principle of international law.⁴⁵\n\nCyber-diligence applies the due diligence obligation to cyberspace specifically.⁴⁶ States should exercise cyber-diligence over cyber activity within their “legal or regulatory control.”⁴⁷ It is the concept of territorial sovereignty which underpins all due diligence obligations.⁴⁸ But what is “territory” in cyberspace, when the realm has no physical boundaries?\nReferences to cyberspace in this paper adopt a dualistic character: the virtual domain which facilitates internet communications and the physical hardware sustaining the domain’s operation.⁴⁹ Cyberspace, as an intangible medium, can only exist inside tangible infrastructure.⁵⁰ It operates via “networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures”⁵¹ located within a State’s territory.⁵² Within their territory, States enjoy exclusive legal authority over: (1) cyber-infrastructure; (2) cyber-activity associated with their cyberinfrastructure, and; (3) persons engaged in cyber activity.⁵³ States should also bear a primary due diligence obligation to ensure that their infrastructure is not used to harm the equal sovereignty of other States.⁵⁴ A State’s failure to exercise due diligence should constitute an internationally wrongful act.⁵⁵ Some States resist the idea of cyber-diligence obligations, avoiding additional burdens on their resources and perceived overregulation of cyberspace.56 Others firewall domestic internet, creating a\"closed national network\"averse to foreign influence.57 Cyber-diligence's current generality renders it extant in theory, but an afterthought in practice.\nThis section identifies the source of cyber-diligence obligations. But States ought to be informed of what positive actions fulfil the obligation (Section III) and when these actions should be undertaken (Section IV). First, this paper explores a characteristic of due diligence obligations: strong in adaptability but weak in enforcement.\n# III. CONTENTS OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION ## A. Obligation of Conduct versus Obligation of Result58 Due diligence is a\"relative, not absolute,\"59 obligation of conduct. States have the discretion to adopt any feasible measures to prevent cyberattacks injuring other States,60\"without warranting that the [attacks] will not occur.\"61 Breach of the obligation turns on whether a territorial State took all appropriate measures to protect the victim TY: THE GENERAL PART 227 (2013).\n\nLiu State from attack.⁶² Whether the territorial State had “genuine capacity to avert the threat” in the circumstances informs the assessment.⁶³ Due diligence obligations differ from obligations of result, which require that a State must prevent the occurrence of a cyberattack, regardless of the means employed.⁶⁴ These obligations represent a State’s absolute guarantee to reach a precise outcome.⁶⁵ Imposing an obligation of result in cyber-diligence would likely require States to adopt burdensome practices. Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.⁶⁶ ## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty Obligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States.⁶⁷ The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States.⁶⁸ In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence... into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”⁶⁹ ⁶².

INT’L L. 371, 375 (1999).\n\nHowever, an obligation of conduct's elasticity has deficiencies. First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks.⁷⁰ Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation.⁷¹ Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.”⁷² As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises.⁷³ The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”⁷⁴ Cyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”,⁷⁵ establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained... the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”⁷⁶ This paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature.⁷⁷ But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework.\n⁷⁰.

Cyber-Diligence should not adopt the Preventive Principle We begin our examination with the preventive principle, a significant element within established due diligence models. The principle requires States to take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of transboundary damage where the risk is known.78 Preventive cyber-diligence would oblige States to create and maintain a clean infrastructural environment, in advance of any cyberattacks.79 We will not address the precautionary principle, which applies in the absence of scientific certainty that a risk will cause harm.80 It is settled that cyberattacks could cause serious injury.81 Some commentators82—and a U.N. Working Group83—posit that States should undertake preventive cyber-diligence.84 The suggestions include:85\n\nLiu\n\nA number of these procedural steps constitute custom in international environmental law.[87] While these measures could obviate transboundary harm, they would do little to suppress ongoing or imminent cyberattacks. For instance, risk assessment identifies vulnerable networks. States could secure these networks, improve long-term network health, and make future cyberattacks harder to execute.[88] But risk assessment would do little to reduce injuries from a cyberattack that is underway. Hacktivists can launch attacks from infrastructure in States with lower cybersecurity,[89] diverting the source but not the effect of the eventual injury.[90] Another preventive measure could be to destroy malicious software (\"malware\") capable of being\"weaponized\"in a cyberattack. But nearly 200,000 new malware codes are identified daily.[91] The negligible effects of\"search and destroy\"operations do not warrant State expenditure.[92] Preventive measures are of minimal use when cyberattacks penetrate computer networks and cause instant injury. The territorial State should assist instead in the\"rescue effort\". They should engage skilled experts INCIDENTS: LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 60-61 (2010).\n\nLiu to alleviate bandwidth limitations, isolate the malicious data causing actual injury in the victim State, and cooperate in investigations.⁹³ Below, we revisit the preventive principle's origins in international environmental law. We shall demonstrate that a State's preventive duties should be confined to the circumstances in which it arose, transboundary environmental harm.⁹⁴ ## C. International Environmental Law This subsection discusses the rationale behind the preventive principle, contrasting cyber-threats against environmental threats. It disputes cyberspace's status as a global resource and argues that the polluter pays principle ought to be adopted in cyber-diligence.\nScholarship and jurisprudence on preventive due diligence is most developed in international environmental law. Commentators draw an analogy between prevention of\"noxious activity\"and prevention of\"information pollution.\"⁹⁵ The source of preventive obligations can be traced back to the\"no harm\"principle (sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas).⁹⁶ States must not cause significant transboundary damage to the environment of another State.⁹⁷ In Trail Smelter, the arbitral tribunal proclaimed:\"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory... to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another...\n⁹³.

However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of\"natural resources... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the\"neighbouring State\"concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103 We dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State. A cyberattack can be directed from any distant location connected to the internet and traverse numerous States before it harms a network.¹⁰⁵ Second, the I.C.J.'s jurisprudential promotion of the preventive principle aims to secure the environment's long term sustainability and avoid disturbance to its ecological balance.¹⁰⁶ Environmental damage cannot easily be undone.¹⁰⁷ The harm's irreversibility underpins societies' willingness to adopt aggressive steps to control the perceived risk.¹⁰⁸ This rationale is not transferable to cyberspace. Cyberspace, still in its infancy, has seemingly infinite resources.¹⁰⁹ Permanent cyberspace degradation is not an issue: servers can be restored after attacks and security breaches can be repaired. At worst, physical infrastructure and data destroyed in a cyberattack still would not affect the overall functioning of the cyberspace domain.\nStates have no impetus to restrict private actors from\"polluting\"cyberspace. The\"tragedy of the commons\"theory reasons that\"we are locked into a system of fouling our own nest\".¹¹⁰ This is because the cost of the waste\"[a person] discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying [her] wastes.\"¹¹¹ We do not foul the cyberspace\"nest\"because no amount of\"cyberwaste\"can (currently) overload and inhibit cyberspace functions. The medium fosters independent gain without fear of endangering the cyberspace platform.\nThe\"polluter pays\"principle should be applied to shift the duty of prevention onto private industry. (This should sit alongside States criminalising cyber-offences for individual liability.) As Alan Boyle suggests,\"it may be simpler, quicker, and economically more efficient to make polluters... pay rather than States.\"¹¹² State regulations should ¹⁰⁵.

The\"Polluter Pays\"Principle Should Be Adopted The Rio Declaration defines the polluter pays principle:\"national authorities should endeavour to promote the internalisation of environmental costs... the polluter should, in principle, bear the costs of pollution.\"Municipal law and State responsibility should jointly account for injuries from cyberattacks. States' cyber-diligence obligations should include implementing domestic criminal and civil liability. This would harmonize the interests of territorial States (to avoid full liability) and victim States (to access legal redress at the domestic and international levels).\nFirst, States should identify the cyber-polluter(s) to which liability attaches. In environmental law, liability attaches to the operator causing pollution, but also\"on other people specifically identified as being at the origin of the damage.\"Civilly liable persons include, for example, the carrier of dangerous goods contaminating the environment, and the owner of a ship from which polluting oil escaped.\n\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nIn cyberspace, the polluter's\"payment\"should expand beyond monetary compensation (damages or taxes) to individual civil and criminal liability. The\"cyber-polluter\"should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable.\nSecond, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to\"threat intelligence\"companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence,\"cyber-pollution\"should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126] Directing a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for\"cyber-pollution\"incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability. Consumer perception of network owners' cyber vulnerability could result in reputational and stock-price hits. The 45, entered into force May 30, 1996.\n\nmarket itself incentivises network owners to adopt cybersecurity.¹²⁷ State regulation should reinforce economic deterrence: “unclean” network owners should not receive government tenders and private contracts.¹²⁸ But emphasising private law reparations would have downsides. First, a private liability regime could dilute State responsibility, moving questions of cyber-diligence from public international law into private international law.¹²⁹ The principle risks “exonerating certain subjects of international law from their share of responsibility for damage” caused by cyberattacks.¹³⁰ Second, civil liability does “not always [guarantee] real compensation for the damage caused to the environment.”¹³¹ A compensation scheme does not rectify the damage already caused to networks. To counter this inadequacy, States ought to take positive steps to terminate cyberattacks that are in progress and mitigate injury as far as possible. They should also bear cooperation duties to help restore injured networks post-cyberattack.¹³² In limited State practice, victim States readily initiate prosecution under domestic criminal laws after they ascertain a hacker’s identity. In 2007, cyberattacks targeted Estonia’s government websites, e-services, and information infrastructure after Estonia removed a Soviet-era memorial.¹³³ Attack methods included denial of service (“DOS”),¹³⁴ ¹²⁷.

Rather, despite its shortcomings, States should use the polluter pays principle to pressure industry to improve cybersecurity. States should implement the principle into domestic law as part of their cyber-diligence obligation.\nHaving established that the due diligence obligation in environmental law does not fit with cyberspace, we visit another possible analogy for cyber-diligence: due diligence in the marine environment. As is taken up later, cyberspace, unlike the high seas, is not a res communis. An analogy with the marine environment also impractically extends the scope of cyber-diligence obligations to nationals outside territorial control. But it provides guidance for an adequate regulatory framework in cyber-diligence.\n## D. International Law of the Sea Part XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"UNCLOS\") enshrines States' due diligence obligations within the marine environment. Article 192 establishes the general obligation to\"protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁴ Under Article 193, States enjoy the sovereign right to exploit natural resources, but must also take measures to prevent pollution to the marine environment.¹⁴⁵ Several differences arise when applying due diligence obligations in the marine environment compared to cyberspace. First, due diligence obligations under UNCLOS do not exclusively attach to sovereignty.¹⁴⁶ Vessels may operate in areas where States enjoy mutual rights. Articles 192 and 193 oblige flag States to ensure conservation of living resources, including in the exclusive economic zones of other States.¹⁴⁷ To discharge this obligation, flag States ought to ensure vessels within their jurisdiction and control\"do not undermine [their] obligations... to protect and preserve the marine environment.\"¹⁴⁸ The arbitral ¹⁴⁴.

A State’s cyber-diligence obligation should not extend to terminating a cyberattack initiated by a national abroad.¹⁵² In the sea, a flag vessel’s physical location is identifiable. A State’s due diligence obligation follows their flag vessels’ chartered territory. In cyberspace, a State exercises authority over infrastructure within their exclusive control both in their territory and extraterritorially.¹⁵³ But a State’s jurisdictional control of their nationals assumes different characteristics. The operations of transnational non-State actors (and their data trails) are often borderless, simultaneously residing in multiple jurisdictions.¹⁵⁴ ¹⁴⁹.

In this situation, besides a duty of cooperation to assist a victim State's investigations of their national, State A should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation to terminate the cyberattack.\nSeparately, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea's (\"ITLOS\") Seabed Disputes Advisory Opinion articulates internal laws and regulations which States ought to adopt to fulfil due diligence obligations.[156] UNCLOS places due diligence obligations on States who engage contractors for projects within international waters (sponsoring States).[157] Sponsoring States are required to\"[adopt] laws Liu and regulations and [take] administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction.”¹⁵⁸ The following table distils principles from ITLOS’ advisory opinion, summarising how they may be applied to cyber-diligence.¹⁵⁹ These suggestions should be read in light of the “cyber-polluter pays” argument.¹⁶⁰ The same due diligence principles apply under UNCLOS and environmental law, demonstrating their uniformity.\nvisory Opinion, supra note 70, paras 124-50; Southern Bluefin Tuna, supra note 100, para. 77; see infra, III.C. and V.\n¹⁵⁸.

See infra, III.C.\n\n|  Extracted Principles | Cyber-Diligence Application  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (1) To fulfil due diligence obligations, sponsoring States must enact laws, regulations, and administrative measures enforcing the obligations of contractors.1 Contractual arrangements are insufficient.2 | Territorial States should: (1) criminalise cyberattacks causing serious injury in foreign territory and; (2) incentivise network owners to secure infrastructure.  |\n|  (2) “[The obligations] may include [establishing] enforcement mechanisms for active supervision of the activities of the sponsored contractor.”3 | States should:○ In grants and tenders, prioritise corporations with clean “track records” or those diligently securing their networks. These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases.  |\n|  (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity.  |\nLiu\nThese measures depend on the capacity and policy traditions of the territorial State,¹⁶¹ and favour governmental intervention. Temporary restrictions on the free market in certain sectors facilitates efficient pursuit of wider social goals, including cybersecurity.\nCyber-diligence and due diligence obligations from the Law of the Sea have diverging jurisdictional features. However, the Seabed Disputes Chamber offers a paradigm against which a State's domestic regulatory response can be measured.\nInternational cooperation also boosts cybersecurity. Next, we canvass the State of international cybersecurity cooperation and propose a number of initiatives as part of a State's duty to co-operate. The difficulties of enforcing cooperative duties in particular cyberincidents should not be overlooked.\n## E.

For example, a bilateral agreement between Russia and Estonia enshrined “obligations” to transfer evidence, assist in investigations, and extradite alleged perpetrators of criminal offences.¹⁶⁹ In spite of this, Russia refused to assist Estonia’s investigations after the 2007 cyberattacks. Russia’s interpretation of the treaty excluded surveillance measures identifying a perpetrator’s physical location.¹⁷⁰ A restrictive interpretation conceals, perhaps, a lack of cooperative will.¹⁷¹ Some States possibly favour a poorly regulated cyberspace.¹⁷² States can leverage assistance to gain traction with allies, or refuse TY PLANNING (2016), http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Security-Planning/; EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY, EUROPEAN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENCE (EP3R) (2009) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies; German Federal Office for Information Security, IT-Grundschutz (2016), https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/; Shackleford, supra note 20, at 29.\n¹⁶⁵.

Conversely, States may not seek or provide assistance for fear of exposing their cyber vulnerabilities or cyber-technology.[173] Cooperative duties nonetheless need to be\"clear, useful, and doable.\"[174] To complement current regimes, they ought to immediately contain a cyberattack. States should commission cybersecurity experts,[175] and: Experts could be exchanged between contracting agencies within cooperating States.[176] Each State could mobilize experts from multiple jurisdictions if cyberattacks occurred or if their private sector demanded increased protection. States with cyber-monitoring capabilities may warn others, in advance, of increased malicious traffic indicating imminent cyberattack(s).[177] A target State can then boost network capacity in anticipation. In ongoing cyberattacks, assisting States may host servers, transfer bandwidth, and eliminate botnet traffic.\nBut these suggestions remain aspirational. First, duties to co-operate are obligations of conduct\"formulated in a relatively weak way,\"[178] which do not drive outcomes. In Southern Bluefin Tuna, a treaty obligation required parties to\"consult, [and] resolve the dispute by negotiation or other peaceful means of their own choice.\"[179] The parties were only Liu obliged to continue to seek settlement through negotiation, rather than coming to an actual settlement.¹⁸⁰ A unilateral referral of the dispute to judicial settlement or arbitration was ineffective.¹⁸¹ Indeed, as the Estonia-Russia Treaty illustrates, States exercise discretion in their adherence to a cooperation treaty.¹⁸² Second, some commentators stress that States bear a legal obligation to cooperate in reducing cyber threats, as cyberspace integrity is relevant to international security.¹⁸³ Katharina Ziolkowski argues: “the internet presents another global resource [which is] in the common interest of the international community.”¹⁸⁴ We ought to exercise caution before suggesting cooperative duties that have arisen within the natural environment or the seabed¹⁸⁵ apply to cyberspace.\nUnlike the high seas,¹⁸⁶ or outer space,¹⁸⁷ cyberspace is not a “common concern of humankind” (res communis).¹⁸⁸ States recognize a res communis when: (1) exploitation of accumulated resources benefits each State; and (2) collective governance serves greater utility compared Tuna (N.Z. v. Japan; Austl. v. Japan), 38 I.L.M. 1624, 1647 (Judge ad hoc Shearer).\n\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nto dividing the space into smaller parts.¹⁸⁹ Cyberspace is not a natural, indivisible asset. Each State is encouraged to invest in cyberspace to reap economic, political, and social benefits.¹⁹⁰ States currently have no incentive to agree on a common regulatory regime in cyberspace. Doing so would decrease their margin of appreciation to set cyberspace priorities. Any common interests in cyberspace fasten on ensuring the platform's development, so that each State can advance their private interest. States increasingly “[establish sovereign control] in the virtual world in the name of security and economic sustainability.”¹⁹¹ Third, cooperative efforts will likely be limited to agreements between politically aligned States. The European Union has initiated best-practice and cyber-intelligence exchanges.¹⁹² The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology collaborates with “the U.K., Japan, Korea, Estonia, Israel and Germany” to spread best practice in domestic cybersecurity.¹⁹³ Perhaps this paper’s assessment of international cooperation appears overly negative. Initially, the above passages may indicate international law is epiphenomenal, allowing powerful States to grant their cooperation at will.¹⁹⁴ However, we do not endorse a realist perspective which refutes the normative value of *pacta sunt servanda*.¹⁹⁵ Our critique questions whether current cooperation regimes are effective in the face of a particular cyberattack. Expecting obligations of cooperation to bring utopian cybersecurity will inevitably disappoint. But the value of regional and multilateral cooperation schemes to improving cybersecurity cannot be ignored.^[196]^ As the Estonian incident demonstrates,^[197]^ the effectiveness of multilateral conventions in a cyberattack depends on a signatory's willingness to assist under those circumstances. Failure to assist incurs no enforceable sanction,^[198]^ but these conventions could spur domestic cybersecurity adoption.^[199]^ The fact that some States already cooperate through treaties demonstrates the effect of international law.^[200]^ As James Crawford states,\"like good coffee, international law has to be brewed.\"^[201]^ The cybersecurity coffee is yet percolating.\nCooperative duties are process-driven, limiting their ability to achieve outcomes. However, a central consultative body that facilitates cooperation could spark increases in cyber-diligence capacity. We turn to counter-terrorism for direction. The next subsection defines the similarities between cyberattacks and terrorism and argues that cyber-diligence should resemble Resolution 1373's counter-terrorism model of due diligence. Adoption of this model would be conditional on an event which heightens expectations of States' compliance with cyber-diligence obligations.\n\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\n# F. Prevention of Transnational Terrorism\n## 1. Introduction\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks share parallels. The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed.²⁰² We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\"²⁰³ A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.²⁰⁴\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats.²⁰⁵ These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law.²⁰⁶ They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory.²⁰⁷ Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n²⁰² Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear... to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.”²⁰⁸ A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.²⁰⁹ ## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison International law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network”²¹⁰ without a formal hierarchy.²¹¹ Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”.²¹² Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.²¹³ Anonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.”²¹⁴ The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream, Liu political correctness.²¹⁵ Like Al-Qaeda, Anonymous has a decentralized command system. Its\"ops\"begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to\"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling\"anons\"into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites.²¹⁶ In 2012,\"anons\"initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline.\"Operation Anti-ACTA\"responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.²¹⁷ Anonymous proclaimed that the agreement\"[enslaves] the internet.\"²¹⁸ While the government website was down, Polish politicians opposed to the agreement wore Guy Fawkes masks (the symbol of the Anonymous movement) in Parliament.²¹⁹ Private actors domiciled across different States accomplish Al-Qaeda and Anonymous'\"successes\". They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.\n\n# 3. Incorporating the Counter-Terrorism Model of Due Diligence\nStates bear an obligation to prevent the terrorist conduct of non-State actors. The obligation existed within custom and conventions well before 9/11.²²⁰ However, this paper focuses on the counter-terrorism standard of due diligence established within Resolution 1373.\nIn handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.”²²¹ States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.”²²² The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.²²³\nResolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations.²²⁴ States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation).²²⁵ These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security,²²⁶ which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.²²⁷\n²²⁰.

Security Council and\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nResolution 1373 established the Counter-Terrorism Committee (\"C.T.C.\") and required\"all States to report to the Committee... on the steps they have taken to implement this resolution.\"²²⁸ The C.T.C. initiated a transnational\"capacity building blitz\".²²⁹ The S.C. should similarly establish a Cyber-Diligence Committee (\"C.D.C.\"). First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks.\n## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision Resolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures.²³⁰ The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies,²³¹ and does not enforce sanctions on those who\"fail\"to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment.\nThe U.N. General Assembly has established the Group of Governmental Experts in Information Security (\"G.G.E.\"), signalling an intention to centralise cybersecurity efforts.²³² The Group outlines International Terrorism, in Bianchi &amp; Naqvi eds, supra note 26, at 83-92; see also SUNSTEIN, supra note 85, at 123.\n\nthat:\"States... should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit [internationally wrongful acts] using ICTs.\"²³³ As a result, 25 States have tabled reports on their internal cybersecurity policies.²³⁴ The U.N. should go beyond inviting open-ended cybersecurity reports and establish a C.D.C. to regulate international capacity building efforts for cyber-diligence. The C.D.C's overall goal should be to assist (particularly developing) States building capacity to prevent cyberattacks. A gradual improvement in capacity throughout all 191 U.N. member States could decrease the frequency of cyberattacks, although this will take time, and requires ample financial resources.²³⁵ The C.D.C's specific functions should resemble those of the C.T.C.: appoint experts to advise States on cyber-diligence compliance,²³⁶ coordinate assistance between donors and donees,²³⁷ and elicit compulsory written reports on States' capacity building measures. A C.D.C. reduces the discretion of States to determine appropriate measures for cyber-diligence. Through reviews, the C.D.C. should implicitly set a due diligence standard for States to meet in acquiring capacity. A C.D.C. should stress the relative nature of cyber-diligence and not stretch the obligation into one of absolute prevention.²³⁸ (It should centralize responsibility for co-ordinating cyber-diligence efforts, but preserve due diligence as an obligation of conduct.)\n\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nHowever, a capacity-building focus has limitations. It risks creating a disparity between States' reported capacity and their actual exercise of that capacity.²³⁹ Unresolved tensions include: In the counter-terrorism context, Tal Becker proposes that due diligence standards should apply to a State: Becker’s proposed standards should be incorporated into States’ cyber-diligence obligations. The C.D.C. should supervise States’ compliance with limb (1). States who fail to notify the C.D.C. of their capacity deficits should be disentitled from pleading a lack of capacity if a subsequent cyberattack implicates their networks.²⁴³ This approach limits the responsibility of unable but willing States for a particular cyberattack, provided they have fulfilled limb (1) to the extent of their capacity. Other domestic exigencies may militate against ²³⁹. BECKER, supra note 202, at 128.\n²⁴⁰. U.N. Charter art. 2(7).\n²⁴¹.

BECKER, supra note 209, at 146.\n²³⁰ Liu a State's exercise of cyber-diligence capabilities.²⁴⁴ If so, a State should not be held in violation of limb (2), taking into account the particular circumstances at the time of the cyberattack.\nIf *able but unwilling* States simply ignore limb (2), establishing a failure to exercise cyber-diligence would be relatively straightforward. However, difficulties arise where *able but unwilling* States exercise cyber-diligence “half-heartedly”. For instance, a State could neutralise a third of the total botnets emanating from their territory (when they have the capacity to terminate the entire cyberattack).²⁴⁵ To establish violation, the victim State ought to prove that the territorial State did not employ their full capacity to prevent the cyberattack.²⁴⁶ There is no “quick fix” to these tensions. Nonetheless, a C.D.C. should introduce an internationally calibrated strategy to capacity building in cyber-diligence. Far from being merely theoretical, 159 States have received counter-terrorism assistance as a result of the C.T.C.²⁴⁷ A C.D.C. realises the UN’s role of equipping States with the *capacity for* cyber-diligence,²⁴⁸ but not overstepping its intergovernmental character to intervene in States’ actual exercise of cyber-diligence.²⁴⁹ This section argues that the contents of a State’s cyber-diligence obligation should include: (1) the “cyber-polluter pays” principle; (2) implementing regulations for industry to secure infrastructure, and; (3) capacity-building via consultation with the C.D.C. But States ought to know what circumstances enliven their obligation to fulfil these contents. The following section considers the two key triggers of cyber-diligence obligations: knowledge and injury.\n\n# IV. TRIGGERING THE DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE\nA. Does Actual or Constructive Knowledge Trigger Cyber-Diligence?\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, a sovereign's responsibility for their subjects' actions consists of \"forbearance\" and \"protection shewn to transgressions.\"²⁵⁰ The sovereign must: (1) know of the transgression and; (2) fail to prevent or punish the delinquency.\nKnowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility.²⁵¹ States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it.²⁵² Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury.²⁵³ There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion.²⁵⁴ A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.²⁵⁵\nThis paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:\n\n- a State ought to have known of a cyberattack, or; - a State had information on a cyberattack, and was obliged to undertake further inquiries, but failed to do so; Categories (1) – (2) constitute subjective knowledge, while categories (3) – (4) amount to constructive (objective) knowledge. First, we demonstrate that all four categories should suffice to trigger cyber-diligence. Second, we suggest an appropriate standard of proof to establish a territorial State’s knowledge before an international court or tribunal (“international tribunal”).\n## 1. Subjective Knowledge is Difficult to Establish ### i. Categories 1 and 2 Subjective knowledge is the highest degree of intent. A State either intended the cyberattack to cause serious injury, or endorsed the outcome. In judicial proceedings, victim States may struggle to establish a territorial State’s actual knowledge or connivance. The accused State’s sovereignty shrouds any evidence of subjective knowledge in secrecy. It is unthinkable that an accused State would surrender documents ²⁵⁶.

Alb.), 1949 I.C.J. Rep. 4, para. 85 (Apr. 9) (Judge Azevedo).\nLiu revealing internal decisions,²⁵⁸ especially given the lack of discovery procedures in State-on-State litigation.\nSome commentators posit that knowledge only arises when victim States notify territorial States of cyberattacks.²⁵⁹ In Tehran Hostages, the I.C.J. relied on notification to infer Iran's actual knowledge of militant raids. Iran was\"fully aware... of the urgent need for action,\"²⁶⁰ given\"repeated calls for help\"to the Iranian Foreign Ministry.²⁶¹ Iran's inaction was\"due to more than mere negligence or lack of appropriate means.\"²⁶² However, victim States rarely notify territorial States of a cyberattack. Notification consumes time, does little to reduce injury, and tarnishes inter-State relations. Instead, a State will likely devote their resources to withstanding a cyberattack. In the Estonian incident, botnet infiltrations implicated computers in 178 countries.²⁶³ Estonia did not notify one territorial State. Instead, Estonia increased bandwidth capacity (so networks could handle increased traffic), filtered malicious transmissions, and engaged U.S. and N.A.T.O. assistance to terminate sources of the attack.²⁶⁴ Some territorial States voluntarily neutralized sources of attacks.²⁶⁵ In 2008, Georgia and Russia engaged in armed conflict over the South Ossetia region. Georgia suffered concurrent cyberattacks on their governmental, commercial and media networks, (supposedly) coordinated via Russian infrastructure.²⁶⁶ Georgia, a\"cyber-locked\"State, relied on neighbouring States' cyber infrastructure to facilitate their internal traffic.²⁶⁷ The primary channel for Georgia's internet connectivity flowed through Russia.²⁶⁸ Georgia did not notify Russia of the cyberattacks, instead relocating important servers to the U.S.²⁶⁹ Google's secure servers temporarily hosted a news portal,²⁷⁰ and NATO also secured Georgian networks.²⁷¹ If only notification could enliven knowledge, then no cyber-diligence could ever be triggered in incidents like the cyberattacks on Estonia and Georgia. Victim States mitigate loss and boost defences when a cyberattack begins. Politically allied States disable attack sources and offer relief networks.²⁷² Victim States do not benefit from notification.\nThe knowledge threshold to trigger cyber-diligence should be lowered. Kimberley Trapp argues (in the counter-terrorism context):\"requiring proof of subjective knowledge would effectively act as a bar to any finding of responsibility for a failure to prevent.\"²⁷³ A territorial State's cyber-diligence obligation should be triggered if they\"ought to have known\"of a cyberattack.\n## 2. Constructive Knowledge Should Trigger Cyber-Diligence Obligations ### i. Category 3 International jurisprudence supports constructive knowledge triggering due diligence. In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J's majority judgment relied on a series of inferences to conclude that the minefield laying\"could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of Albania.\"²⁷⁴ The majority inferred Albania's knowledge according to objective standards.\n²⁶⁷.

Corfu Channel, supra note 44, at 19-20.\nLiu The U.K. was not required to prove Albania knew (subjectively) of the mines' presence.²⁷⁵ Notably, two dissentients (Judge Azevedo and Judge Krylov) held Albania was under a continuous duty to inform itself of reasonably foreseeable threats in its territory,²⁷⁶ or, as Ian Brownlie argues, “[to] take reasonable care to discover activities of trespassers.”²⁷⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the I.C.J. found that a State’s obligation to prevent the occurrence of genocide is engaged “at the instant that the State learns of, or should normally have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.”²⁷⁸ Engaging the obligation to prevent genocide is tantamount to triggering cyber-diligence if the State should have reasonably known of the attack’s occurrence.²⁷⁹ In Asian Agricultural Products, the Tribunal emphasized Sri Lanka bore a duty to exercise “[an] ‘objective’ standard of vigilance in assessing the required degree of protection and security... for foreign investors.”²⁸⁰ The language of these cases suggest that constructive knowledge should be established if the territorial State had information that a cyberattack might occur and failed to conduct further inquiries.\nElsewhere, some commentators argue constructive knowledge should be presumed when a cyberattack implicates a State’s exclusive governmental infrastructure.²⁸¹ The aggrieved State ought to establish that the attack travelled through the territorial State’s governmental infrastructure.²⁸² Constructive knowledge is prima facie established if the infrastructure was under direct State control and used only for public purposes.283 This approach should be tempered. Indications of government infrastructure's involvement in a cyberattack can be deceiving. First, non-State hackers may compromise a government server.284 A cyberattack being mounted from government infrastructure does not in itself establish responsibility in the cyber context.285 Second, cyberattacks are often dressed with\"spoofing\"(identify manipulation) techniques. In the Estonian incident, spoofing clouded evidence which incriminated Moscow's exclusive infrastructure: unknown perpetrators could have adopted the veil of a Moscow government computer.286 Often,\"onion routing\"techniques are used to conceal perpetrators' identity.287 The majority of cyberattacks use such masquerading tactics.288 Even if network logs suggest a cyberattack exploited government infrastructure, the victim State should still be bound to adduce evidence to dismiss spoofing concerns.\nSome commentators stretch the presumption of constructive knowledge further. They advocate a reverse presumptio juris whenever a cyberattack is associated with government infrastructure,289 or when\"injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State.\"290 International tribunals would shift the burden of proof onto the territorial State, who must disprove their presumed constructive knowledge.291\n\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nReversal of the burden of proof conflicts with I.C.J. jurisprudence.²⁹² In Corfu Channel, the I.C.J. did not infer Albania's constructive knowledge of injurious activity purely based on their exclusive territorial control. Territorial control does not “[shift] the burden of proof... in relation to unlawful acts perpetrated therein.”²⁹³ In Pulp Mills, the I.C.J. stated “a preventive approach... does not [operate] as a reversal of the burden of proof.”²⁹⁴ It is not for the territorial State to prove its diligence. State control over governmental networks only gives rise to “abstract and immaterial knowledge” of a cyberattack, insufficient to presume State responsibility.²⁹⁵ But victim States may use the accused State's control over government infrastructure as evidence. Section IV.A.3. explains how a pattern of such evidence should establish constructive knowledge. But first, we examine how constructive knowledge would operate under category 4.\n## ii. Category 4 With reference to Section III.F.3., should a C.D.C. framework be established, a degree of constructive knowledge should be presumed. Territorial States would be held to a standard of vigilance in maintaining their cyber-territory, and constructive knowledge of an ongoing or imminent attack would be imputed to these States. States would have less latitude to plead a lack of capacity to discover a particular cyberattack.\nPresuming knowledge would reflect heightened expectations for State compliance with cyber-diligence obligations.²⁹⁶ The victim State still bears the burden of proof²⁹⁷ and should establish knowledge to a clear and convincing standard to discharge their burden in an international tribunal.\n## 3. Overcoming the Evidentiary Hurdle: Standard of Proof Typically, a failure in due diligence will be raised after the victim State (“applicant”) suffers injury. The issue turns to causation. How does the applicant gather sufficient evidence to establish that actual or constructive knowledge triggered the territorial State’s (“respondent”) cyber-diligence obligation?²⁹⁸ The applicant will struggle to establish their case absent the respondent’s assistance or at least consent to evidence collection.²⁹⁹ The I.C.J. acknowledges that victim States face evidentiary difficulties, allowing a “more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence... provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.”³⁰⁰ But the standard of proof in an international tribunal should not be lowered “simply because it is... difficult to reach.”³⁰¹ The standard “[protects] the respondent against false attribution... a particularly serious risk in the cyber context.”³⁰² The applicant must produce reliable and neutral evidence to establish that the respondent at least ought to have known of the cyberattack.³⁰³ They could rely on experts to adduce logs of the respondent’s network behaviour during the cyberattack.³⁰⁴ An international tribunal may OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE: A COMMENTARY 1245 (Andreas Zimmermann et al. eds, 2012).\n\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\ncommission its own experts to evaluate the reliability of such evidence.³⁰⁵ The applicant may also produce documentary data and press reports³⁰⁶ to establish the respondent had sufficient information to make further inquiries into the cyberattack, but failed to do so.\nSome commentators advocate for a “very liberal approach to evidence [in cyberspace].”³⁰⁷ They contrast the anonymity of cyberattacks against kinetic threats, which are physically traceable, before, during, and after the attack.³⁰⁸ However, the primary rule invoked in a matter determines the standard of proof.³⁰⁹ International tribunals should not adopt a low standard of proof in due diligence matters. As Durward Sandifer argues: “in dealing with sovereign States... it cannot lightly be presumed that one of the parties to the litigation is guilty of negligence.”³¹⁰ Doing so may result in evidence of low probative value establishing a breach of due diligence, which would undercut the presumption that States observe international law.³¹¹ Conversely, the standard of proof should not be so “unduly exacting” that it becomes impossible to meet.³¹² Rep. 2014 (Mar. 31), p. 226, 237 paras 18-20, 255-57 paras 73-82, 283 paras 188-90, 290-93 paras 217-227; The South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of Philippines v.

The applicant ought to produce\"sufficiently clear\"³¹³ and weighty evidence to meet the standard.³¹⁴ The applicant could realistically gather sufficient evidence to establish a reasonable inference of the respondent's constructive knowledge.³¹⁵ The standard also precludes international tribunals finding violations of international law based on unconvincing evidence,³¹⁶ especially given these proceedings rarely have appeal mechanisms.³¹⁷ However, cyberattacks may regularly implicate governmental cyber-infrastructure in particular States.³¹⁸ This paper argues that an applicant establishes constructive knowledge to a clear and convincing standard if it adduces evidence of: Greenwood).\n\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\nPropensity then assists an applicant to overcome a lack of probative evidence if confronted with an uncooperative territorial State. It also incentivizes States to secure (at least) their governmental infrastructure. But the approach does not prejudice States who lack the capacity to safeguard their governmental infrastructure.³²⁰ Questions of a State's actual or constructive knowledge are contingent on a judicial forum's evidentiary standards. Together, they form the\"knowledge\"element to trigger cyber-diligence obligations. A threshold of constructive knowledge proven to a clear and convincing standard has been advanced. This paper now turns to the second trigger-element: injury.\n## B. What Level of Injury Engages A Cyber-Diligence Duty?\nInjury is not a pre-requisite to finding an internationally wrongful act under the laws of State responsibility.³²¹ Once a breach is attributed to a State, responsibility is potentially engaged, subject to application of the primary rule.³²² In the context of due diligence, however, damage is a condition to finding a violation of the primary rule.³²³ A State who failed to exercise cyber-diligence is only liable for breaching the primary rule after hostile acts, contrary to another State's legal rights, occur.³²⁴ When\"due diligence is violated, there is an attribution to the State... of the consequences of the acts of [private] persons.\"³²⁵ ³²⁰.

Cyber-diligence obligations\"re-establish the status quo erat.\"³²⁹ With that in mind, this section defines\"serious injury\"to trigger States' cyber-diligence obligations.\nThe Tallinn Manual defines an\"unlawful [cyber] act\"as\"all cyber activities from one State's territory that affect the rights of other States [producing] a negative effect.\"³³⁰ The definition covers any operation affecting\"sovereignty\": a lower level of injury compared to an act of interference³³¹ or armed force.³³² However, when is\"a negative effect\"of sufficient gravity to trigger cyber-diligence? Jurisprudence and the literature establish a context-dependent standard of serious injury. In *Trail Smelter*, the arbitral tribunal stated\"no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury... when the case is of serious consequence.\"³³³ Some commentators state that\"serious injury\"triggers the duty, without further explanation.³³⁴ The Tallinn Manual ambiguously concludes that\"physical damage to objects or injuries to ³²⁶.

The concept does not define what measures a State should take during the occurrence of the injury. In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.³³⁶ This paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories.³³⁷ We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation. The types of injury listed are non-exhaustive, but represent differing levels of severity.\n## 1. Injury to Persons or Loss of Life; Physical Damage or Destruction of Objects Cyberattacks which cause physical damage equivalent to conventional attacks could constitute armed force or armed attack (when launched by a State).³³⁸ While discussions of *jus ad bellum* are beyond this paper’s scope, several observations should be made.\nFirst, category 1 represents cyberattack injury of the highest severity. Any physical harm to persons or objects would trigger a territorial State’s cyber-diligence obligation.³³⁹ But it is very rare for a cyberattack to cause category 1 damage.

Schmitt ed., *supra* note 25, rule 5 cmt para. 5.\nLiu chaos by shutting down air-traffic control, dams or transportation infrastructure remain hypothetical. Some argue that attacks on critical national infrastructure (such as water supply and electricity grids) would likely lead to secondary consequences of physical injury to persons and objects.³⁴⁰ An attack on one critical network has a “synergistic effect,”³⁴¹ propagating injury to other connected physical infrastructures.\nSuch conclusions need to be balanced. The scale and duration of a cyberattack and the effectiveness of the target State’s response determines the likelihood of category 1 injuries. In 2015, for the first time, a cyberattack struck an electricity grid, in Ukraine. The attackers hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) systems in seven substations,³⁴² disconnecting power to 225,000 Ukrainians for three hours. Some had anticipated an “electronic Pearl Harbour” once a cyberattack hits an electric grid.³⁴³ This did not occur. The Ukrainian energy providers shifted to manual operations and restored electricity quickly. No physical damage to infrastructure occurred.³⁴⁴ Second, as yet, only State organs are equipped and motivated to inflict material injury using cyber-offensive capabilities.³⁴⁵ Such a cyberattack would automatically be considered an act of the State.³⁴⁶ Liability turns on attribution and the breach of an international Liu obligation. Questions of whether a State failed to prevent the injury emanating from their territory become immaterial. A State may forego invoking intermediary cyber-diligence breaches if the injury is serious, preferring to treat it instead as armed force or armed attack so as to enliven jus ad bellum. Non-State hacktivists rarely (if ever) cause physical injury. Hackers instead inundate networks with DDOS attacks or implant malware and extract information.[347] Third, no reported cyberattack has yet caused injury to persons or loss of life.[348] Some have come close: hackers infiltrated a hospital network and lethally altered a patient's dosages, only to be discovered by a nurse before the drug was administered.[349] Debate exists about whether the 2010 Stuxnet virus actually caused physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.[350] Stuxnet took control of SCADA networks, manipulated data and controlled the processing speed of centrifuges. One commentator argues that the injury suffered was a mere usurpation of the SCADA networks and not injury to the physical integrity of the centrifuges.[351] Apart from Stuxnet, to date, we have been unable to identify a single cyberattack which has caused physical damage to a network's physical components and not merely destroying data or incapacitating network functions.[352] Cyberattacks overloaded and temporarily suspended networks in the Estonian and Georgian incidents.[353] But, despite social and economic disruptions, no network reportedly suffered destructive or permanent injuries. A rigid requirement of physical damage or destruction (perhaps more suited to conventional attacks) is inappropriate for cyber-diligence. The cyber-diligence obligation prevents injury to cyber networks and infrastructure. A lower level of damage should also trigger cyber-diligence. One commentator notes:\"the dependency of modern societies on [computer] networks has made it possible to incapacitate physical infrastructures without destroying them.\"# 2. Loss of Network Functionality Most cyberattack methods disrupt target networks. Cyberattacks could overwhelm a network with botnet requests, cause system malfunction, or otherwise degrade the quality of network services.[357] Herbert Lin distinguishes between a (destructive)\"cyberattack\"and a (non-destructive)\"cyber-exploitation\".[358] The former renders a network unavailable, or undermines the network's integrity, without destroying any physical components.[359] For instance, DDOS attacks on Estonian infrastructure temporarily reduced accessibility to crucial services in the financial, telecommunications, media, and government sectors.[360] The attack significantly hindered the ability to conduct financial transactions, resulting in losses to industry and Estonian citizens.[361] This paper argues that once a cyberattack causes serious disruptions to a network's proper functioning, the cyberattack is then\"destructive\", Liu and constitutes “serious injury.”³⁶² Cyber-diligence obligations should be triggered as soon as the primary injury incapacitates a network, rising to the level of “destructiveness.”³⁶³ The disruption should not simply be inconvenient, but should have a substantially detrimental effect “on the ability of the owner or operator to use the system, or communicate with other systems.”³⁶⁴ The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”) defines system interference as “the serious hindering... of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.”³⁶⁵ This definition could be applied to determine whether a cyberattack is “destructive”.³⁶⁶ A progressive interpretation of “destructive” should extend beyond damage which mirrors that of a kinetic attack. Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries.\nSecondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack.³⁶⁷ The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm.³⁶⁸ Due diligence standards change according to “new scientific or technological knowledge [and] risks involved in the activity.”³⁶⁹ Primary injury to certain infrastructures could disrupt downstream access to essential service(s) for a protracted period.³⁷⁰ If predictions of cyberattacks on health systems or transportation infrastructure materialise, the standard of cyber-diligence should rise to correspond to the increased risk. States should be obligated, with reference to the primary infrastructure affected, to take proportionate action to prevent or reduce secondary injuries (to the extent possible).³⁷¹ ## 3. Cyber-Exploitations The third category of\"injury\"results from stealthily executed cyber activities, unknown the victim.\"Cyber-exploitation\"describes an activity intended to clandestinely access and exploit a network's vulnerabilities without disturbing the network's operation.³⁷² Intelligence gathering operations most frequently cause this\"injury\".³⁷³ Hackers emplace malware into a network to collect information for economic or political purposes. Cyber-exploitations could also probe a network for vulnerabilities in preparation for future cyberattacks.³⁷⁴ The term\"injury\"is hesitantly used to refer to category (3). It is unclear what injury cyber-exploitation actually causes to a victim State.\"[An] infringement of rights or legally protected interests\"activates cyber-diligence obligations.³⁷⁵ The question turns on whether peacetime cyber-exploitation infringes a target State's territorial sovereignty.³⁷⁶ Arguably, covert cyber-exploitations which intrude on a network and extract data violate the\"honor, dignity or prestige of a State\"³⁷⁷ Liu constituting injury\"of a moral, political and legal nature.\"³⁷⁸ Some commentators argue that cyber-espionage\"can result in harm to the country at least as severe as a physical attack.\"³⁷⁹ Nonetheless, the legality of peacetime cyber-espionage is highly disputed.³⁸⁰ Data collection programs including Ghostnet, PRISM and Tempora continue,³⁸¹ implicitly tolerated by States, who\"will not want to deprive themselves of this tool.\"³⁸² There is no clear answer as to whether cyber-exploitations constitute\"serious injury\"for cyber-diligence purposes. Invoking another State's failure to prevent cyber-exploitation will likely be perceived as hypocritical.³⁸³ The Committee on Offensive Information Warfare notes that\"the distinction between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation may be very hard to draw from a technical standpoint and may lie primarily in the intent of the user.\"³⁸⁴ Indeed, a single cyberattack can cause category (2) and (3) effects. A hacktivist might plant monitoring software and or Application of Two Agreements, Concluded on 9 July 1986 between the Two States and which Related to the Problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affairs (N.Z. v. Fr.)

The (initially) non-destructive operation can mature, in real time, into a destructive cyberattack.\nSuccessful cyber-exploitation, which operates within a network, normally goes unnoticed.³⁸⁶ Cyber-diligence cannot be triggered without sufficient knowledge and should only be triggered when destructive effects materialise.\n## 4. Cyber-Vandalism, Irritation and Computer Crime The Tallinn Manual regards\"mere irritation or inconvenience\"as not of sufficient seriousness to trigger cyber-diligence.³⁸⁷ Low-intensity cyber-vandalism does not cause serious disruption to a State and is appropriately classified as a domestic cybercrime under the Budapest Convention.³⁸⁸ 85% to 97% of all cybercrimes are not revealed let alone prosecuted.³⁸⁹ Such laxity in enforcement demonstrates States' passive tolerance of low-intensity cybercrimes.³⁹⁰ To counter\"close to unlimited\"instances of cyber-vandalism,³⁹¹ States should improve domestic cybercrime regulation and dedicate cyber-diligence resources to preventing higher categories of injury.\nMarco Roscini argues that defacement alters computer data and should be characterized as a disruptive cyberattack (category 2\n\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations\n\ninjury).³⁹² But it is difficult to see how defacement and propaganda goes beyond “visual corruption of public webpages”.³⁹³ Defacement may be considered offensive or even slanderous, depending on the target State’s political orientation. But unlike “destructive” cyberattacks, defacement merely causes superficial injuries to a network. Hacktivists intend to transmit unwanted political messages, not to overthrow a regime.³⁹⁴ *Oppenheim’s International Law* notes that due diligence obligations do not extend to “suppress[ing] criticism of, or propaganda directed against, other States or governments on the part of private persons.”³⁹⁵ Roscini himself recognizes that defacement is “relatively innocuous [and] psychological.”³⁹⁶ Cyber-diligence should not “imply an obligation to suppress all such conduct [inimical to] the regime or policy of a foreign State.”³⁹⁷ Despite the difficulties of retrospectively evaluating “serious injury”, this threshold reflects States’ concerns about cyberattacks which disable infrastructural operations. Under our formulation, cyber-exploitation and defacement fall below the threshold. States would likely avoid burdensome cyber-diligence for cyber activity of low-intensity, largely tolerated internationally.\nThe final section outlines hypothetical cyberattack scenarios and explores whether best-practice exchanges could set an implicit standard of cyber-diligence.\n\n# V. ASSESSING BREACH OF THE CYBER-DILIGENCE OBLIGATION\nThe preceding sections define the contents and triggers of cyber-diligence obligations. This paper now discusses violation of the primary obligation.\nBreach of the primary obligation fastens on a State's knowledge, capacity to prevent, and the level of injury caused. Pierre-Marie Dupuy states: \"the true breach of an obligation of conduct is the breach of an obligation to behave (in a legally defined way).\"³⁹⁸ The accusing State needs to establish that they would not have suffered injury, or would have suffered less injury, if the accused State exercised cyber-diligence. Injury is not the decisive element. Breach is evaluated according to whether, at the origin of the injury, a State failed to do all it could to prevent the end result.³⁹⁹ As soon as a territorial State does not take all appropriate measures to stop a cyberattack, the cyber-diligence obligation has been violated.⁴⁰⁰\nThe obligation, articulated in theory, does not capture the infinite scenarios which may arise in practice, including when:⁴⁰¹\n\n³⁹⁸. Dupuy, supra note 69, at 379.\n³⁹⁹. Id.; Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/498, 28 [86]; cf. Crawford, supra note 201, at 310.\n⁴⁰⁰. Economides, supra note 60, at 377.\n⁴⁰¹. BECKER, supra note 202, at 151-52.\nState Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations These situations are highly abstract and all presuppose that a State has requisite knowledge and that the cyberattack causes serious injury. Variable factors across these situations determine breach. Assessment of breach ought to be “realistic and context-sensitive,”⁴⁰² particularized to the circumstances in question. Theoretically, the State in situation (1) has exercised cyber-diligence to the extent of their capabilities, satisfying the obligation. The State in situation (3) has, by contrast, failed to do all it could to stop the cyberattack, and breaches their obligation. Situation (2) is less clear: international law does not dictate States’ domestic resource-allocation.⁴⁰³ In reality, establishing responsibility is not straightforward. To evade responsibility, an accused State could claim: The accusing State then bears the unenviable burden of establishing breach.\nPredicting a breach of cyber-diligence with confidence is difficult. First, there is no minimum standard of cyber-diligence to measure compliance against.⁴⁰⁵ Second, a State’s acquiescence to a cyberattack is also likely to be covert and publicly denied.⁴⁰⁶ Third, cyber-diligence is a “moveable target”, constantly evolving as cyberspace technology develops.⁴⁰⁷ Liu The 2015 G.G.E. report recommended that the U.N.\"consider initiatives for international dialogue and exchange on ICT security issues.\"⁴⁰⁸ A C.D.C. which encompasses\"U.N. agencies, the private sector, academia and civil society organisations\"⁴⁰⁹ could facilitate best-practice exchanges. S.C. Resolution 1377 invited the C.T.C. to promote counter-terrorism best-practice and prepare model laws.⁴¹⁰ A C.D.C. could do the same, and implicitly define an expected standard of care for cyber-diligence between member States.\nBest Management Practices (\"BMPs\") in counter-piracy provide a useful example of the best-practices approach to solving problems. Devised by the International Marine Organisation and the shipping industry, the BMPs increased vessels' successful resistance to piracy by 25%.⁴¹¹ Adopting these self-help recommendations (including such matters as speed, security equipment, and watchkeeping) were in the vessels' best interests. Compliance minimized insurance premiums and decreased the probability of pirate capture.⁴¹² There is no guarantee that adopting and disseminating best-practice will achieve these results for cyber-diligence. Cyber-powers or private industries must be willing to share their (actual) best-practices before any dialogue improves cyber-diligence capabilities. Private industry could monetise cyberattack prevention capabilities and offer their services to the highest bidder. There is limited transparency in cybersecurity efforts:⁴¹³ States and industry are unlikely to openly disclose the full extent of their technical capacity.⁴¹⁴ Improving cyber-diligence may not be favourable to the geopolitical agendas of some Liu States;⁴¹⁵ an unregulated cyberspace “gives [States] more room to explore new ways of projecting power.”⁴¹⁶ Despite these barriers, a number of States have submitted voluntary reports on domestic cybersecurity practices in 2015⁴¹⁷ and 2016.⁴¹⁸ We hope that cyber-defence technology matures and is shared through best-practice dialogue. It remains unclear whether best-practice compliance will become attractive to States.\n# VI. CONCLUSIONS Our world is increasingly digital. Cyber-infrastructure now underpins many of the essential features of a modern society. Cyberspace pervades our lives and the dangers of its ill-use are publicly recognized. Citizens reap the benefits of cyber-technology, at the same time expecting governments to shield them from transnational cyber-threats.⁴¹⁹ On interconnected threats, the U.N. Secretary General has remarked: “we must found a new security consensus, the first article of which must be that... whatever threatens one threatens all.”⁴²⁰ Indeed, cyber-technology disregards political and cultural borders and grants unlimited reach to private actors. But there is no need to panic.\n\nLiu Governments, in Cass Sunstein's words, should\"take careful steps to ensure that laws and policies reduce, and do not replicate, the errors to which fearful people are prone.\"⁴²¹ The same applies for international law.\nThis paper assesses cyber-diligence practically, pre-empting how States may respond to a range of cyberattack outcomes. It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an\"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\"of serious consequences from a cyberattack.⁴²² Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example.⁴²³ Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects.\"Serious attacks\"affecting network functionality are few and far between. But the Estonian and Georgian incidents demonstrate that they can occur.\nAt a minimum, to establish breaches of cyber-diligence, the victim ⁴²¹. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 226.\n⁴²². Id. at 39; SUNSTEIN, supra note 80, at 120.\n⁴²³. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 45.\nLiu State must produce clear and convincing evidence: The above elements establish a cyber-diligence framework.

The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed.²⁰² We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\"²⁰³ A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.²⁰⁴\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats.²⁰⁵ These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law.²⁰⁶ They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory.²⁰⁷ Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n²⁰² Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

They appear... to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.”²⁰⁸ A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.²⁰⁹ ## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison International law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network”²¹⁰ without a formal hierarchy.²¹¹ Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”.²¹² Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.²¹³ Anonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.”²¹⁴ The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream, Liu political correctness.²¹⁵ Like Al-Qaeda, Anonymous has a decentralized command system. Its\"ops\"begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to\"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling\"anons\"into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites.²¹⁶ In 2012,\"anons\"initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline.\"Operation Anti-ACTA\"responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.²¹⁷ Anonymous proclaimed that the agreement\"[enslaves] the internet.\"²¹⁸ While the government website was down, Polish politicians opposed to the agreement wore Guy Fawkes masks (the symbol of the Anonymous movement) in Parliament.²¹⁹ Private actors domiciled across different States accomplish Al-Qaeda and Anonymous'\"successes\". They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.\n\n---\n\n## # VI. CONCLUSIONS Our world is increasingly digital. Cyber-infrastructure now underpins many of the essential features of a modern society. Cyberspace pervades our lives and the dangers of its ill-use are publicly recognized. Citizens reap the benefits of cyber-technology, at the same time expecting governments to shield them from transnational cyber-threats.⁴¹⁹ On interconnected threats, the U.N. Secretary General has remarked: “we must found a new security consensus, the first article of which must be that... whatever threatens one threatens all.”⁴²⁰ Indeed, cyber-technology disregards political and cultural borders and grants unlimited reach to private actors. But there is no need to panic.\n\nLiu Governments, in Cass Sunstein's words, should\"take careful steps to ensure that laws and policies reduce, and do not replicate, the errors to which fearful people are prone.\"⁴²¹ The same applies for international law.\nThis paper assesses cyber-diligence practically, pre-empting how States may respond to a range of cyberattack outcomes. It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an\"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\"of serious consequences from a cyberattack.⁴²² Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example.⁴²³ Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects.\"Serious attacks\"affecting network functionality are few and far between. But the Estonian and Georgian incidents demonstrate that they can occur.\nAt a minimum, to establish breaches of cyber-diligence, the victim ⁴²¹. SUNSTEIN, supra note 419, at 226.\n⁴²².

    "# STATE RESPONSIBILITY AND CYBERATTACKS\n\n## DEFINING DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS\n\nIan Yuying Liu\n\nFaculty of Law, Monash University\n\nE-mail: ian.liu@hotmail.com\n\nCyberattacks are proliferating. Live trackers record over 6 million cyberattacks daily. Information technology-dependent societies increasingly perceive cyber-threats as a destabilising force and citizens inevitably look to the State for protection. This paper concerns one form of State protection: whether States owe due diligence obligations in cyberspace under the laws of State responsibility. Specifically, it re-examines the contents of such an obligation and the circumstances which could trigger it in light of cyberattacks' peculiarities. A straightforward replication of due diligence models from international environmental law or law of the sea is not appropriate. But cyber-diligence should incorporate certain principles found within both models and channel ultimate responsibility for securing cyber-infrastructure onto private industry. Counter-terrorism obligations are the most useful body of law in which to seek an analogy. This paper argues that a State's cyber-diligence obligation is triggered, at a minimum, by: (1) constructive knowledge of a cyberattack, (2) which causes serious injury to an operating network. These contents and triggers define a cyber-diligence framework. Public pressure on the State and the market to intensify responses to transnational cyber-threats will drive the adoption of such principles.\n\nKeywords: Information Technology Law, Non-State Actors, Cyber War, National Security, Internet Governance.\n\nThis paper was initially written in partial fulfilment of my LLB at Monash University.

    "Liu\n\n# A. Introduction\n\nCyberspace has “developed from [networks] of academic researchers into a mainstream communications mechanism.”¹⁶ Unfortunately, enhanced information flow results in the medium’s misuse. States ought to assume greater responsibility to combat one type of misuse—cyberattacks. Specifically, States should bear a cyber-diligence obligation to prevent cyberattacks which originate from their territories. As sovereigns with powers of enforcement within their territory, States are in the best position to limit private action. After all, individual hackers are present within a state’s jurisdiction.\n\nMany States have also implemented cybersecurity strategies to secure domestic cyber-infrastructure.¹⁷ Despite these efforts, global cybersecurity has not progressed beyond non-binding agreements.¹⁸ “Conflicting political agendas… espionage [and] competition for global influence”¹⁹ all work against custom crystallizing.²⁰ Cyber-diligence obligations, if imposed, would represent inter-State cybersecurity\n\n16.

The literature on cyberattacks in international law, as of this writing, has not addressed this subject matter in detail. The present paper's proposed framework for cyber-diligence fills this void.\n\nThe present paper focusses on a State's cyber-diligence obligation with respect to \"peacetime\" cyberattacks, not rising to the level of armed force or armed attack.²⁸ These attacks constitute the majority of cyberattacks orchestrated by private hackers.²⁹ Cybersecurity and cyberattacks both, ironically, rely on skilled individuals: attackers exploit, States defend. For international law to intervene, cyberattacks initiated by non-State actors must be linked to the State.\n\nFirst, this paper examines the source and character of the primary rule which may make that link. Due diligence obligations derive from States' territorial sovereignty. Cyber-diligence should be classified as an obligation of conduct.

Private industry owners, as the proponents of cyber-infrastructure, should bear a preventive obligation to secure their networks and “self-police”: monitoring, filtering, and isolating the sources of cyberattacks.\n\nCyberattacks are often covertly executed and realize instant effects. Territorial States should be obliged to block ongoing cyberattacks which cause serious injury and assist with investigations. However, cooperation duties will likely be of minimal use in cyberattacks. Current counter-terrorism obligations offer a viable model for cyber-diligence, given the parallels between the threats they seek to combat. To that end, a United Nations (“U.N.”) committee should similarly be established to supervise States’ capacity building efforts.\n\nThird, this paper defines the elements which trigger cyber-diligence obligations. It argues the obligation should be engaged when: (1) States have constructive knowledge of the cyberattack; and (2) the cyberattack produces serious injury. Setting a constructive knowledge threshold eases the victim State’s evidentiary burden. Clear and convincing evidence, equitable to both States in litigation, should satisfy the standard of proof. Serious injury occurs when a cyberattack: (1) causes physical damage to individuals or objects; or (2) incapacitates a computer network.\n\nFourth, this paper considers breach of the cyber-diligence obligation.

Cybersecurity cannot, as yet, provide impenetrable network protection. Even the most diligent State, with the highest capacity, cannot guarantee that their infrastructure will not be compromised.⁶⁶\n\n## 1. Undesirable Uncertainty\n\nObligations of conduct readily adapt to cyber-diligence. Their flexibility accords with a disparity between the technical capabilities of different States.⁶⁷ The obligation does not levy excessive burdens on developing States, who typically do not have the capacity to carry out diligence on the same level as developed States.⁶⁸ In evolving areas of international law, obligations of conduct “[integrate] new standards of diligence . . . into customary international law as they are progressively adopted by State practice.”⁶⁹\n\n⁶².

    "Liu\n\nHowever, an obligation of conduct's elasticity has deficiencies. First, States enjoy wide latitude in deploying available means to prevent cyberattacks.⁷⁰ Second, failing to achieve a specific result in each instance does not necessarily breach the obligation.⁷¹ Obligations of conduct are indeterminate, “lacking precise stipulation of the means to achieve the specified result.”⁷² As long as a State has endeavoured to realise a result, it will not have violated the primary rule, even if a cyberattack materialises.⁷³ The obligation “contains an undeniable degree of subjectivity [which varies] according to the epoch, the circumstances and the particular [State] in question.”⁷⁴\n\nCyber-diligence then becomes an obligation to attempt, without any precise guidance on how a State should attempt to terminate cyberattacks. Unless a State has deliberately withheld resources during a cyberattack or simply “gone through the motions”,⁷⁵ establishing breach of the obligation is difficult. Accusing States must prove “the damage sustained . . . the lack of diligence, and the causal relation between the two elements.”⁷⁶\n\nThis paper offers a (conditional) solution to overcome the obligation’s imprecise nature.⁷⁷ But for the moment, we turn to examine and select principles within established due diligence models to formulate the contents of a cyber-diligence framework.\n\n⁷⁰.

Monitoring suspicious activity.\n\nA number of these procedural steps constitute custom in international environmental law.[87] While these measures could obviate transboundary harm, they would do little to suppress ongoing or imminent cyberattacks. For instance, risk assessment identifies vulnerable networks. States could secure these networks, improve long-term network health, and make future cyberattacks harder to execute.[88] But risk assessment would do little to reduce injuries from a cyberattack that is underway. Hacktivists can launch attacks from infrastructure in States with lower cybersecurity,[89] diverting the source but not the effect of the eventual injury.[90] Another preventive measure could be to destroy malicious software (\"malware\") capable of being \"weaponized\" in a cyberattack. But nearly 200,000 new malware codes are identified daily.[91] The negligible effects of \"search and destroy\" operations do not warrant State expenditure.[92]\n\nPreventive measures are of minimal use when cyberattacks penetrate computer networks and cause instant injury.

    "Liu\n\nwhen the case is of serious consequence.\"98 Derived from this principle, a territorial State must undertake preventive measures to regulate third party pollution, in advance of any materialised environmental harm.99\n\nAn analogy to environmental law's preventive approach is enticing. However, we should not extrapolate obligations that have arisen in the context of the natural environment100 to suggest that they have become general principles of international law. The natural environment is a finite global resource vulnerable to permanent degradation from human activity.101 International environmental law provides legal protection against hazardous activities threatening the health of \"natural resources ... such as air, water, soil, fauna and flora.\"102 The preventive principle is inextricably linked with the \"neighbouring State\" concept. It regulates transboundary activity on one State to preserve natural resources located on a neighbouring State.103\n\nWe dispute the preventive principle's adaptability to cyberspace. First, cyberspace is not a natural resource, but a product of human ingenuity. Barriers of distance and time are immaterial to cyberspace's virtual existence.104 Territoriality should not be the focus of preventive regulations in cyberspace: the source of the harm is not limited to the (geographically) neighbouring State.

Cyberspace, still in its infancy, has seemingly infinite resources.¹⁰⁹ Permanent cyberspace degradation is not an issue: servers can be restored after attacks and security breaches can be repaired. At worst, physical infrastructure and data destroyed in a cyberattack still would not affect the overall functioning of the cyberspace domain.\n\nStates have no impetus to restrict private actors from \"polluting\" cyberspace.

    "Liu\n\nIn cyberspace, the polluter's \"payment\" should expand beyond monetary compensation (damages or taxes) to individual civil and criminal liability. The \"cyber-polluter\" should include both individual hackers and infrastructure operators. Hackers are responsible for the causative activity: they deliver cyberattacks which injure a network. Operators who fail to secure their infrastructure enable cyberattacks to be directed from, or routed through, their networks. Liability should extend to both these parties located at the source of the damage.[121] This differs from environmental pollution, where a polluting entity alone is liable.\n\nSecond, State regulation is required to ensure the individual liability of cyber-polluters. States ought to: (1) enact and enforce national legislation criminalising cyberattacks;[122] and (2) make network owners, such as Huawei, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and China Telecom responsible for securing their private infrastructure.[123] The owners may outsource the task to \"threat intelligence\" companies, such as Norse, who should continuously monitor network health, deny security breaches in real-time, and pre-emptively refuse dangerous signals.[124] Territorial States' judicial systems should be amenable to foreign claims against private industry.[125] As with cyber-diligence, \"cyber-pollution\" should only engage a polluter's responsibility when cyberattacks cause serious injury.[126]\n\nDirecting a degree of primary responsibility onto corporations for \"cyber-pollution\" incentivises industry to develop best-practice and minimise liability. Consumer perception of network owners' cyber vulnerability could result in reputational and stock-price hits. The\n\n45, entered into force May 30, 1996.\n\n121.

First, a private liability regime could dilute State responsibility, moving questions of cyber-diligence from public international law into private international law.¹²⁹ The principle risks “exonerating certain subjects of international law from their share of responsibility for damage” caused by cyberattacks.¹³⁰\n\nSecond, civil liability does “not always [guarantee] real compensation for the damage caused to the environment.”¹³¹ A compensation scheme does not rectify the damage already caused to networks. To counter this inadequacy, States ought to take positive steps to terminate cyberattacks that are in progress and mitigate injury as far as possible.

These corporations offer a more attractive product than their less diligent competitors.4○ Alternatively, stimulate competition in the network owners' market and reduce barriers to entry into the domestic market for “clean” overseas competitors. The new competitors would encourage domestic corporations to improve network security and heighten industry benchmarks for cybersecurity.5○ Ensure their judicial apparatus is available for civil litigation against the owners of compromised networks.○ Issue fines and regulatory warnings to non-compliant corporations in specific cases.  |\n|  (3) Domestic laws and regulations must be “no less effective than international rules, regulations and procedures, primarily [those] adopted by the [International Seabed Authority].”6 | With reference to Section III(C)(3),7 a supervisory committee should prescribe a minimum standard of diligence for States to meet in acquiring cyber-diligence capacity.  |",

The definition of international terrorism has long been disputed.²⁰² We adopt the definition established in the Security Council's (\"S.C.\") Resolution 1566: terrorism consists of acts \"with the purpose to provoke a state of terror . . . and all [other offences] in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.\"²⁰³ A number of these conventions require a transnational component before an act constitutes terrorism.²⁰⁴\n\nInternational terrorism and cyberattacks both constitute transnational threats. A shared ideology or \"functional imperatives\" rally members across national boundaries into a transnational group to execute these threats.²⁰⁵ These groups defy conceptions of the State as a self-contained unit in international law.²⁰⁶ They flout a State's supreme authority in a given territory.²⁰⁷ Due diligence obligations link these groups to State responsibility and counter their de-territorialized threat to State-centricity.\n\n²⁰² Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism (League Convention 1937), Annex I art. 1(2), LoN Doc.

    "Liu\n\nBehr describes these threats as “real, effective and powerful, [but not] permanently present and visible. They appear . . . to have gone to nowhere, when suddenly they reappear at different places.”²⁰⁸ A terrorist blends into the civilian population before carrying out an act of violence. A cyberattack’s malicious traffic blends indiscriminately into the internet exchange before it inflicts injuries.²⁰⁹\n\n## 2. Al-Qaeda and Anonymous: A Comparison\n\nInternational law integrates non-State actors into its counter-terrorism and cyber-diligence frameworks. An analogy between two organisations harbouring “terrorism” and cyberattacks illustrates the similarities of both threats.\n\nAl-Qaeda may have the greatest reach of any transnational militant organisation. Al-Qaeda resembles a decentralized “cultural and social network”²¹⁰ without a formal hierarchy.²¹¹ Its network spans continents and comprises of cells, nodes, and guerrilla terrorist groups linked by a central modus operandi of subverting “Western ideology”.²¹² Family, ethnicity and nationality determine: (1) the targets of recruitment and training and; (2) which groups manage operations in a particular geographical area.²¹³\n\nAnonymous is a hacktivist movement. It coordinates operations (“ops”) which retaliate against a specific event or general censorship. The phenomenon began on the internet forum 4chan, notorious for internet free speech. Anonymous has become emblematic of cyber-libertarian values: declaring “information wants to be free.”²¹⁴ The group deliberately transgresses what they see as sanitized, mainstream,\n\n208. *Id.* at 114.\n209.

Its \"ops\" begin by disseminating content on entities or events perceived as a threat to \"free speech\". The movement then explains priorities and targets, calling \"anons\" into action, usually to launch DDOS attacks and deface websites.²¹⁶ In 2012, \"anons\" initiated DDOS attacks on the Polish government website, taking it offline. \"Operation Anti-ACTA\" responded to the Polish Government signing a multilateral agreement to reduce copyright violation.²¹⁷ Anonymous proclaimed that the agreement \"[enslaves] the internet.\"²¹⁸ While the government website was down, Polish politicians opposed to the agreement wore Guy Fawkes masks (the symbol of the Anonymous movement) in Parliament.²¹⁹\n\nPrivate actors domiciled across different States accomplish Al-Qaeda and Anonymous' \"successes\". They are ideological movements, without a visible hierarchy, and challenge the effectiveness of direct attribution to secure State accountability for private actions. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\"), the international community has developed a renewed model of due diligence in counter-terrorism. Given the parallels between terrorism and cyberattacks, the post-9/11 counter-terrorism model would be the most useful law-by-analogy to apply. The focus should be to improve capacity for cyber-diligence across all 191 U.N. member States.\n\n215. D.C.

    "Liu\n\n# 3. Incorporating the Counter-Terrorism Model of Due Diligence\n\nStates bear an obligation to prevent the terrorist conduct of non-State actors. The obligation existed within custom and conventions well before 9/11.²²⁰ However, this paper focuses on the counter-terrorism standard of due diligence established within Resolution 1373.\n\nIn handing down Resolution 1373, the S.C. exercised its Chapter VII powers in a legislative fashion for the first time, “[imposing] universally binding obligations without temporal or geographic limitations.”²²¹ States must: “(a) refrain from providing any form of support . . . to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts; (b) take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts; and (c) deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts.”²²² The Resolution also required States to cooperate in “criminal investigations or criminal proceedings” related to terrorist acts.²²³\n\nResolution 1373 clearly intensified States’ counter-terrorism obligations.²²⁴ States are obliged to: (1) prevent terrorism with best efforts (a positive obligation); and (2) refrain from acquiescing to terrorism (a negative obligation).²²⁵ These (U.S. initiated) obligations present all “terrorism” as “an absolute threat” to international peace and security,²²⁶ which demand unlimited counter-terrorism measures.²²⁷\n\n²²⁰.

    "Liu\n\nResolution 1373 established the Counter-Terrorism Committee (\"C.T.C.\") and required \"all States to report to the Committee . . . on the steps they have taken to implement this resolution.\"²²⁸\n\nThe C.T.C. initiated a transnational \"capacity building blitz\".²²⁹ The S.C. should similarly establish a Cyber-Diligence Committee (\"C.D.C.\"). First, a qualification: the C.T.C. is a by-product of heightened counterterrorism obligations. Currently, the gravity of the cyber-threat is not perceived to be on the same level as international terrorism. A similar level of prevention is not yet legally required. My recommendations, made by analogy, remain academic, and are best preserved for when an event catalyses urgent, transnational responses to combating cyberattacks.\n\n## i. Replicating the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Central Supervision\n\nResolution 1373's operative paragraph 6 has been remarkably successful: all 191 U.N. member States have reported on their counter-terrorism measures.²³⁰ The C.T.C. is a consultative body. It appoints experts to review reports and provides methods for States to acquire counter-terrorism capacity. The Committee maintains a directory of available assistance to remedy States' compliance deficiencies,²³¹ and does not enforce sanctions on those who \"fail\" to comply with Resolution 1373's obligations. It dispassionately tackles a politically charged area and reduces the available terrain for terrorist action and recruitment.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly has established the Group of Governmental Experts in Information Security (\"G.G.E.\"), signalling an intention to centralise cybersecurity efforts.²³² The Group outlines\n\nInternational Terrorism, in Bianchi &amp; Naqvi eds, supra note 26, at 83-92; see also SUNSTEIN, supra note 85, at 123.\n\n228.

The C.D.C's overall goal should be to assist (particularly developing) States building capacity to prevent cyberattacks. A gradual improvement in capacity throughout all 191 U.N. member States could decrease the frequency of cyberattacks, although this will take time, and requires ample financial resources.²³⁵\n\nThe C.D.C's specific functions should resemble those of the C.T.C.: appoint experts to advise States on cyber-diligence compliance,²³⁶ coordinate assistance between donors and donees,²³⁷ and elicit compulsory written reports on States' capacity building measures. A C.D.C. reduces the discretion of States to determine appropriate measures for cyber-diligence. Through reviews, the C.D.C. should implicitly set a due diligence standard for States to meet in acquiring capacity. A C.D.C. should stress the relative nature of cyber-diligence and not stretch the obligation into one of absolute prevention.²³⁸ (It should centralize responsibility for co-ordinating cyber-diligence efforts, but preserve due diligence as an obligation of conduct.)\n\n233.

    "Liu\n\nHowever, a capacity-building focus has limitations. It risks creating a disparity between States' reported capacity and their actual exercise of that capacity.²³⁹ Unresolved tensions include:\n\n1. whether the C.D.C. should impose effective enforcement mechanisms, or respect State decisions on internal social, economic, and political matters;²⁴⁰ and\n2. how the C.D.C. should determine which States: (i) do not have a genuine capacity to acquire or execute cyber-diligence (unable but willing), and; which States (ii) have the capacity (in reality) to exercise cyber-diligence, but decline to do so (able but unwilling).²⁴¹\n\nIn the counter-terrorism context, Tal Becker proposes that due diligence standards should apply to a State:\n\n1. acquiring the (legal, administrative, and resource) capacity to meet their due diligence obligations, and;\n2. “[employing] its capabilities with due diligence”.²⁴²\n\nBecker’s proposed standards should be incorporated into States’ cyber-diligence obligations. The C.D.C. should supervise States’ compliance with limb (1). States who fail to notify the C.D.C. of their capacity deficits should be disentitled from pleading a lack of capacity if a subsequent cyberattack implicates their networks.²⁴³ This approach limits the responsibility of unable but willing States for a particular cyberattack, provided they have fulfilled limb (1) to the extent of their capacity.

However, difficulties arise where *able but unwilling* States exercise cyber-diligence “half-heartedly”. For instance, a State could neutralise a third of the total botnets emanating from their territory (when they have the capacity to terminate the entire cyberattack).²⁴⁵ To establish violation, the victim State ought to prove that the territorial State did not employ their full capacity to prevent the cyberattack.²⁴⁶\n\nThere is no “quick fix” to these tensions. Nonetheless, a C.D.C. should introduce an internationally calibrated strategy to capacity building in cyber-diligence. Far from being merely theoretical, 159 States have received counter-terrorism assistance as a result of the C.T.C.²⁴⁷ A C.D.C. realises the UN’s role of equipping States with the *capacity for* cyber-diligence,²⁴⁸ but not overstepping its intergovernmental character to intervene in States’ actual exercise of cyber-diligence.²⁴⁹\n\nThis section argues that the contents of a State’s cyber-diligence obligation should include: (1) the “cyber-polluter pays” principle; (2) implementing regulations for industry to secure infrastructure, and; (3) capacity-building via consultation with the C.D.C. But States ought to know what circumstances enliven their obligation to fulfil these contents.

Does Actual or Constructive Knowledge Trigger Cyber-Diligence?\n\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, a sovereign's responsibility for their subjects' actions consists of \"forbearance\" and \"protection shewn to transgressions.\"²⁵⁰ The sovereign must: (1) know of the transgression and; (2) fail to prevent or punish the delinquency.\n\nKnowledge remains a pre-requisite of due diligence under modern State responsibility.²⁵¹ States can only interdict a cyberattack if they know of it.²⁵² Herein lies the problem. Cyberattacks are often carried out inconspicuously via \"zombified\" botnets which cause instant injury.²⁵³ There is (usually) no time difference between an attack's initiation and conclusion.²⁵⁴ A State can only possess actual knowledge of a cyberattack after the attack realises injuries.²⁵⁵\n\nThis paper proposes four categories of knowledge to trigger cyber-diligence:\n\n250.

    "Liu\n\n1. Actual knowledge: a State knows of a cyberattack (where a State organ conducts the cyberattack);\n2. Conniance: a State wilfully shuts their eyes to the obvious occurrence of a cyberattack (for example, after detecting the cyberattack or being notified of it);²⁵⁶\n3. Objective evidence leads to a logical conclusion that:\n- a State ought to have known of a cyberattack, or;\n- a State had information on a cyberattack, and was obliged to undertake further inquiries, but failed to do so;\n4. In the event a C.D.C. is adopted, States bear a heightened duty of vigilance to identify and eliminate threats within their territory.²⁵⁷ Constructive knowledge and an obligation to undertake further inquiries are built into this duty.\n\nCategories (1) – (2) constitute subjective knowledge, while categories (3) – (4) amount to constructive (objective) knowledge. First, we demonstrate that all four categories should suffice to trigger cyber-diligence. Second, we suggest an appropriate standard of proof to establish a territorial State’s knowledge before an international court or tribunal (“international tribunal”).\n\n## 1. Subjective Knowledge is Difficult to Establish\n\n### i. Categories 1 and 2\n\nSubjective knowledge is the highest degree of intent. A State either intended the cyberattack to cause serious injury, or endorsed the outcome. In judicial proceedings, victim States may struggle to establish a territorial State’s actual knowledge or connivance. The accused State’s sovereignty shrouds any evidence of subjective knowledge in secrecy. It is unthinkable that an accused State would surrender documents\n\n²⁵⁶.

Iran was \"fully aware . . . of the urgent need for action,\"²⁶⁰ given \"repeated calls for help\" to the Iranian Foreign Ministry.²⁶¹ Iran's inaction was \"due to more than mere negligence or lack of appropriate means.\"²⁶²\n\nHowever, victim States rarely notify territorial States of a cyberattack. Notification consumes time, does little to reduce injury, and tarnishes inter-State relations. Instead, a State will likely devote their resources to withstanding a cyberattack. In the Estonian incident, botnet infiltrations implicated computers in 178 countries.²⁶³ Estonia did not notify one territorial State. Instead, Estonia increased bandwidth capacity (so networks could handle increased traffic), filtered malicious transmissions, and engaged U.S. and N.A.T.O. assistance to terminate sources of the attack.²⁶⁴ Some territorial States voluntarily neutralized sources of attacks.²⁶⁵\n\nIn 2008, Georgia and Russia engaged in armed conflict over the South Ossetia region.

Victim States mitigate loss and boost defences when a cyberattack begins. Politically allied States disable attack sources and offer relief networks.²⁷² Victim States do not benefit from notification.\n\nThe knowledge threshold to trigger cyber-diligence should be lowered. Kimberley Trapp argues (in the counter-terrorism context): \"requiring proof of subjective knowledge would effectively act as a bar to any finding of responsibility for a failure to prevent.\"²⁷³ A territorial State's cyber-diligence obligation should be triggered if they \"ought to have known\" of a cyberattack.\n\n## 2.

State control over governmental networks only gives rise to “abstract and immaterial knowledge” of a cyberattack, insufficient to presume State responsibility.²⁹⁵\n\nBut victim States may use the accused State's control over government infrastructure as evidence.

In small-scale cyberattacks targeting limited networks, the entire cyberattack operation could have already concluded once “serious injury” has occurred. Further cyber-diligence measures will be pointless. But in sustained cyberattack operations targeting multiple sectors, initial “serious injuries” should trigger cyber-diligence obligations. This prevents further injuries to other networks.³³⁶\n\nThis paper splits potential injuries from cyberattacks into descending categories.³³⁷ We argue that categories (1) and (2) amount to “serious injury” capable of triggering a State’s cyber-diligence obligation.

Given network interdependency, cyberattacks could cause consequent harm to society without physical destruction. For example, submarine cables facilitate inbound and outbound internet traffic. A cyberattack on a network which controls submarine cables could affect operations in the telecommunications, finance, and transportation industries.\n\nSecondary “flow-on” effects are often the primary intention of a cyberattack.³⁶⁷ The level of cyber-diligence employed should account for whether the primary interference could cause great harm.³⁶⁸ Due diligence standards change according to “new scientific or technological knowledge [and] risks involved in the activity.”³⁶⁹ Primary injury to\n\n362.

But unlike “destructive” cyberattacks, defacement merely causes superficial injuries to a network. Hacktivists intend to transmit unwanted political messages, not to overthrow a regime.³⁹⁴ *Oppenheim’s International Law* notes that due diligence obligations do not extend to “suppress[ing] criticism of, or propaganda directed against, other States or governments on the part of private persons.”³⁹⁵ Roscini himself recognizes that defacement is “relatively innocuous [and] psychological.”³⁹⁶ Cyber-diligence should not “imply an obligation to suppress all such conduct [inimical to] the regime or policy of a foreign State.”³⁹⁷\n\nDespite the difficulties of retrospectively evaluating “serious injury”, this threshold reflects States’ concerns about cyberattacks which disable infrastructural operations. Under our formulation, cyber-exploitation and defacement fall below the threshold.

This paper now discusses violation of the primary obligation.\n\nBreach of the primary obligation fastens on a State's knowledge, capacity to prevent, and the level of injury caused. Pierre-Marie Dupuy states: \"the true breach of an obligation of conduct is the breach of an obligation to behave (in a legally defined way).\"³⁹⁸ The accusing State needs to establish that they would not have suffered injury, or would have suffered less injury, if the accused State exercised cyber-diligence. Injury is not the decisive element. Breach is evaluated according to whether, at the origin of the injury, a State failed to do all it could to prevent the end result.³⁹⁹ As soon as a territorial State does not take all appropriate measures to stop a cyberattack, the cyber-diligence obligation has been violated.⁴⁰⁰\n\nThe obligation, articulated in theory, does not capture the infinite scenarios which may arise in practice, including when:⁴⁰¹\n\n1. A lesser-able State puts their limited capacity to diligent use, doing all they can to stop a cyberattack.\n2. A State has sound cyber-capabilities in general, but is \"resource-poor\" at the time of the cyberattack. The State may have allocated intense resources to other priorities and is unable to terminate the cyberattack.\n3. A State with sound cyber-capabilities, both generally and at the time of a cyberattack, decides not to terminate the cyberattack.\n\n³⁹⁸. Dupuy, supra note 69, at 379.\n³⁹⁹.

    "Liu\n\nThese situations are highly abstract and all presuppose that a State has requisite knowledge and that the cyberattack causes serious injury. Variable factors across these situations determine breach. Assessment of breach ought to be “realistic and context-sensitive,”⁴⁰² particularized to the circumstances in question. Theoretically, the State in situation (1) has exercised cyber-diligence to the extent of their capabilities, satisfying the obligation. The State in situation (3) has, by contrast, failed to do all it could to stop the cyberattack, and breaches their obligation. Situation (2) is less clear: international law does not dictate States’ domestic resource-allocation.⁴⁰³\n\nIn reality, establishing responsibility is not straightforward. To evade responsibility, an accused State could claim:\n\n1. they exercised their best efforts, yet still failed to achieve a result in the face of new cyberattack methods;\n2. a lack of capacity at the time of a cyberattack, given other exigencies;⁴⁰⁴ or\n3. they lacked sufficient knowledge of the cyberattacks.\n\nThe accusing State then bears the unenviable burden of establishing breach.\n\nPredicting a breach of cyber-diligence with confidence is difficult. First, there is no minimum standard of cyber-diligence to measure compliance against.⁴⁰⁵ Second, a State’s acquiescence to a cyberattack is also likely to be covert and publicly denied.⁴⁰⁶ Third, cyber-diligence is a “moveable target”, constantly evolving as cyberspace technology develops.⁴⁰⁷\n\n402.

    "Liu\n\nGovernments, in Cass Sunstein's words, should \"take careful steps to ensure that laws and policies reduce, and do not replicate, the errors to which fearful people are prone.\"⁴²¹ The same applies for international law.\n\nThis paper assesses cyber-diligence practically, pre-empting how States may respond to a range of cyberattack outcomes. It advocates a narrow model of cyber-diligence under international law. Examining possible analogies, the paper concludes that the model of counterterrorism is most applicable to cyber-diligence. It prepares the groundwork on defining cyber-diligence obligations should a catalysing event spur increased cyberspace regulation. Only then, perhaps, can we gauge States' receptiveness to increased cyber-diligence duties in response to public demands. Any obligation of cyber-diligence devised in response to such a catalyzing event should not be an expansive one. The obligation should be limited to acquiring capacity and terminating ongoing cyberattacks. Incorporating a preventive principle from established models of due diligence overlooks the differences between transnational threats and transboundary threats. The former flout jurisdictional control, while the latter can be effectively prevented with a priori regulations.\n\nThis paper offers an alternative argument to the (somewhat radical) calls for an obligation of cyber-diligence following environmental law models. Calls for the application of strict models of diligence reflect an \"inaccurate assessment of [the] probability\" of serious consequences from a cyberattack.⁴²² Such a model would risk hyper-regulating cyberspace to reflect human insecurity. Instead, industry-led preventive measures should secure infrastructure.\n\nWe do not suggest that future cyberattacks could not cause calamities. But cyberattacks are a minor threat compared to natural disasters, for example.⁴²³ Cyberattacks have not injured individuals and arguably have not destroyed physical objects. \"Serious attacks\" affecting network functionality are few and far between.

It is hoped that the framework matches States' concerns in practice and can guide their cybersecurity policies. Beijing and Washington, from our opening example, should not bear a cyber-diligence obligation in relation to defacement of each other's websites. Even if constructive knowledge can be established, the hacktivism did not cause injury of the requisite threshold to trigger the obligation.\n\nCyber-diligence will continue to be debated within academia before States employ relevant measures.
