HOLLIS\nBARRIE SANDER\n\nCyberspace¹ emerged amidst State silence.² Although one State—the United States—played a key role in funding the information and communication technologies (ICTs) that evolved into the modern Internet, it was largely developed by university academics and, later, commercial enterprises.³ There was little input from other States, who were unaware—or uninterested—in the nascent technology and its potential risks and rewards.⁴\n\nSuch silence stands in contrast to the prevalence of States' verbal and physical acts in and about cyberspace today. Cyberspace's rising priority along humanitarian, economic, political, and military lines has spawned an array of\n\n¹ A socio-technical institution, cyberspace involves a multi-layered assemblage of hardware, software, and networks that store and exchange data, including chiefly the Internet. Various ways exist to describe these layers. The bottom 'link' layer includes the physical hardware/media used to access the Internet. The next three layers involve coding – 'network' and 'transport' layers break data into packets and route them between networks. An 'applications' layer converts the routed data into useful things like files, videos, and web sites. On top of these coded layers, a final 'content' layer comprises all information shared across ICTs. Each layer functions independently; at the application layer, for example, Google Chrome works regardless of whether the link layer employs DSL or 5G.

Much of this behaviour has implications for the international legal order as States now regularly participate in the governance of cyberspace (i.e., regulating the Internet's technical architecture) and governance in cyberspace (i.e., delineating what behaviours to prohibit, permit, or require). As States speak out more, however, it begs a question: what are the implications of international law for the State silence that remains?\n\nThe particular conception of State silence that forms the focus of this volume is 'reactive State silence' – the absence of physical or verbal acts of a State against the background of someone else's conduct or claim.5 As this volume's introductory chapter notes, reactive State silence may be legally significant in at least three ways: acceptance, iterating the formation or evolution of international law via concepts like acquiescence;6 lack of acceptance, for example indicating that there is no international agreement;7 or opposition, in the sense of resisting the formation or evolution of international law, for example abstaining from ratifying a treaty or voting in the United Nations General Assembly as evidence of a State's resistance to the formation of a customary rule.8\n\nThe International Law Commission (ILC)'s work on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice suggests silence may constitute 'acceptance ... when the circumstances call for some reaction'.9 Conclusion 10(3) of the ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification elaborates that '[f]ailure to react over time to a practice may serve as evidence of acceptance as law (opinio juris), provided that States were in a position to react and the circumstances called for some reaction'.10 The accompanying ILC commentary delimits circumstances calling for a reaction 'where the practice is one that affects – usually unfavourably – the interests or rights of the State failing or refusing to act'.11 According to the\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

States, courts, and other actors have had virtually (in both senses of the term) nothing to say about these thresholds specifically, or the potential legal salience of reactive State silence generally. The principal exception to this trend is a 2020 statement by the US Department of Defense General Counsel reflecting on whether sovereignty functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace; he suggested that ‘many States’ public silence in the face of countless publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks precludes a conclusion that States have coalesced around a common view that there is an international prohibition against all such operations ...’.¹⁴ Aside from this (brief) remark, we see little mention of any types of circumstances that call for another State’s reaction in the cyber domain, the meaning of a State’s capacity to react in this context, the threshold of knowledge of another State’s practice, or what amounts to a reasonable passage of time to respond.\n\nAgainst this background, our chapter offers an inaugural assessment of how reactive silence implicates international law-making in cyberspace. We do so through both descriptive and normative lenses. First, as a descriptive matter, we differentiate the absence of reactive silence rhetoric in international law from its factual existence in various contexts. We introduce three cases – (i) Internet governance, (ii) secret/covert State sponsored cyber-operations; and (iii) unilateral statements by States about international law in cyberspace – where we can identify reactive State silences and offer tentative thoughts on their legal\n\n¹² Id.

Doing so, in turn, provides a foundation for analysing why States and other stakeholders have yet to recognize reactive silence issues in cyber contexts.\n\nSecond, extant ambiguity about reactive State silence in cyberspace provides grounds for a normative claim: beyond reactive silences, international law would benefit from acknowledging other manifestations of State silence – which we label catalysing and partial silences – to assess international law and cyberspace. Catalysing silence involves the absence of verbal and/or physical acts of States – whether reactive or not – that empower alternative regulatory forms (e.g., voluntary non-binding norms) or authorities (e.g., non-State actor voices about international law). Partial silence involves instances where there is some verbal/physical State response to a claim or conduct (thereby disqualifying it as a ‘reactive silence’) but that reaction remains silent on all relevant international law implications. Like reactive silence, partial silence raises questions of legal salience in terms of acceptance, non-acceptance, and opposition. Thus, we aim to launch a conversation about the capacities and constraints of reactive silence to construct international law in cyberspace while offering additional frames for assessing State silence’s salience to international law overall.\n\nOur chapter proceeds in four parts. We begin with State silence’s role in the Internet governance context, where it generally catalysed ‘multistakeholder’ governance, with its reactive forms exhibiting acceptance by certain States of that model and opposition to other States’ attempts to supplant it with more conventional (i.e., multilateral) international legal frameworks. (I) Next, we turn to State silence vis-a-vis the rising number of State-sponsored cyber-operations, whose secret and/or covert nature may explain both their popularity and why States are reluctant to catalog them as State practices that constitute circumstances calling for a reaction under international law. (II) In this context, we explore whether partial silences in response to such operations have their own legal salience in terms of avoiding the international environment’s ‘default permissive condition’.¹⁵ We then turn to a new trend where certain States have begun to offer unilateral statements on how international law applies to cyberspace, asking if a State’s reactive silence to such statements (or the failure to publicize its own views) have legal salience to international-law making and who authors it. (III)\n\nThese case studies lead us to conclude that, although the cyber context may have little to say about reactive State silence and international law at present, the inattention to this topic itself suggests conditions that may implicate whether and when reactive silences garner legal salience: (i) clarity about the relevant legal\n\n¹⁵ Alexandra Perina, *Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law*, 53 COLUMB.

(IV) Given cyberspace’s status quo, we close with a call for more States to break their silence not only on how international law applies to the cyber domain, but also how to construe any remaining State silences that follow.\n\n## I. State Silence and Internet Governance\n\nInternet governance encompasses ‘the design and administration of the technologies necessary to keep the Internet operational and the enactment of substantive policy around these technologies’.¹⁶ It is not ‘a monolithic system’ but ‘a multi-layered system of administration and operational oversight that spans areas as diverse as standards-setting, cybersecurity, and inter-connection arrangements’.¹⁷ At first, most States greeted this topic with silence. Whether out of ignorance or disinterest, most States did not engage with, or even speak about, the Internet’s governing institutions, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which was founded in 1986 and is comprised to this day by technical experts.¹⁸\n\nIn contrast to most States, the United States was never completely silent about Internet governance. In 1998, building off its early funding, the U.S. Department of Commerce solicited proposals for an institution to regulate the Internet’s naming and numbering system.¹⁹ The winning candidate was a non-profit entity based in Los Angeles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), that proposed to operate the system via ‘multi-stakeholder governance’ where individuals, non-commercial stakeholder groups, industry, and governments would offer inputs on a community-based, consensus\n\n¹⁶ LAURA DENARDIS, THE GLOBAL WAR FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE (Yale University Press 2014), at 6.\n¹⁷ Id., at 226.\n¹⁸ The IETF is responsible for designating technical standards and protocols by which the Internet operates. IETF, Missions and Principles, at https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/.\n¹⁹ Common, shared standards and protocols are necessary for connections to occur among today’s billions of digital devices and thousands of networks. For example, the servers used to send and receive things like e-mail each have an Internet protocol (IP) address while each e-mail address has a ‘domain’ name including top-level domains like .com or .edu and then second-level domains; hence, each university has a second-level domain under the top-level .edu domain (e.g., temple.edu). For this system to work, there must be a coordinated effort to distribute and track IP addresses, assign domain names, and oversee protocol parameter identifiers that are used by Internet standards.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

To be clear, States were not completely silent; in word and deed, they accepted – some more reluctantly than others²⁶ – ICANN’s authority to govern the Internet’s naming and numbering function pursuant to U.S. domestic law (in addition to its Department of Commerce contract, ICANN was\n\n20 Memorandum of Understanding Between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Sept. 30, 2000), at https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/1998/memorandum-understanding-between-us-department-commerce-and-internet-corporation-assigned-.\n\n21 MILTON L.

Yet, when it came to rhetoric about international law or engagement with international legal institutions, many States remained silent. Although neither States nor commentators have reflected on the precise meaning of this reactive silence, in practice it inescapably amounted to State toleration of an approach to Internet governance that did not directly involve international law.\n\nStates' initial toleration of ICANN was periodically subject to disruption as 'sovereigns outside the United States perceived it as a threat to their authority'.[27] Three such efforts – and the reactive silence they generated – warrant attention here. An initial disruption period occurred during the UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) – a multilateral series of diplomatic conferences between 2002 and 2005 that sought to address a diversity of issues related to the information society, but which ultimately morphed into a 'battle over the soul of the Internet'.[28] According to Mueller, WSIS witnessed 'a collision between those who saw national governments as the proper agents for defining and implementing international communication and information policy, and those who pursued a more open, pluralistic, and transnational policy-making framework'.[29] For example, China, with the support of a number of Global South countries, proposed to establish an international Internet organisation and adoption of an Internet treaty.[30] Then, before WSIS's second phase in 2005, the United States back-tracked on promises it had made in 1998 to relinquish authority over ICANN (and the 'root' server that executed its naming and numbering functions) in 2006.[31] The European Union responded by proposing that the governance over the domain name system be shifted from ICANN to a UN-affiliated intergovernmental group.[32] Neither the Chinese nor EU proposals succeeded, but they resulted in a compromise where the US and ICANN retained authority over domain names and numbers, but a new Internet Governance Forum was established where States could offer and discuss recommendations concerning Internet policy.[33]\n\nThe past decade witnessed a second disruptive period as other States and stakeholders revived complaints about U.S. final authority over ICANN and its\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

The differences had deep conceptual underpinnings over whether cyberspace is a 'space' warranting autonomous regulation or a 'technology' that can be regulated by sovereign nations or the international organizations they create.³⁴ Supporting the latter frame, States like China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) sought to legitimize a broad statist approach to Internet governance with both technical and content governance dimensions.³⁵ In terms of technical regulation, these States called for a multilateral organization – the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) – to displace the multistakeholder model of governance embodied by ICANN. In terms of content regulation, under the banner of 'information security' these States sought to legitimize their efforts to monitor and suppress online forms of expression they viewed as a security threat, including expressions of internal dissent and anti-government content.³⁶ For example, in 2009 the SCO adopted an agreement that defined 'information war' in broad terms as 'dissemination of information harmful to political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other States'.³⁷\n\nBoth the technical and content regulation dimensions of the statist vision for Internet governance were embodied in a draft 'Code of Conduct' that China, Russia and other members of the SCO submitted to the UN General Assembly in 2011³⁸ and again in revised form in early 2015.³⁹ As Eliza Watt notes, the Draft\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\n\n34 Scholars have long engaged in similar debates.

Through a multi-year process ending in 2016, the United States relinquished its contractual control over ICANN. In its place, ICANN’s stakeholders adopted a revamped, global, multi-stakeholder model of governance (albeit one still incorporated under California law).56\n\nThe Internet governance context offers four lessons for how we think about State silence generally and reactive State silence in particular. For starters, it contextualizes why there has been so little discussion of reactive State silence and international law in the cyber domain, namely, the absence of international legal mechanisms for governance generally. The emergence of the ICANN multistakeholder regulatory model led to situations where the effects of reactive State silence to both its establishment and attempts to supplant it were so self-evident as to not merit comment. Here, State silence in reaction to ICANN’s emergence inevitably amounted to acceptance (albeit not of the formation or evolution of international law per se), tolerating regulation outside national and multilateral legal structures. At the same time, State silence in reaction to the Draft Codes and the revised ITRs inescapably constituted lack of acceptance or opposition to attempts to supplant the extant multistakeholder model with specific forms of international legal governance.\n\nSecond, the Internet governance context suggests a need to broaden the backdrop against which international lawyers evaluate State silence. Most existing scholarship has considered ‘reactive’ silence in endogenous terms, examining how State silence impacts obligations or institutions in existing and\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

Instead of impacting international law’s contents, here State silence catalyses the contraction of its contours, fostering or supporting other regulatory models, whether the original U.S. national legal authorities or the current multistakeholder framework.\n\nMoreover, State silences in response to the Draft Codes also arguably had a catalysing effect. In particular, State silences on Internet governance frameworks both reflected—and to some extent created—space for other regulatory models to take hold, including: (i) private forms of governance (for example, content moderation rules and practices developed by social media companies like Facebook⁵⁷), (ii) non-binding voluntary norms (for example, the Christchurch Call⁵⁸), (iii) regional human rights law (for example, those focused on the permissibility of different models of intermediary liability frameworks⁵⁹), (iv) negotiations for regional regulations (for example, the European Union’s Digital Services Act package and General Data Protection Regulation⁶⁰), and (v) domestic law (for example, intermediary liability laws and constitutional law⁶¹). The result is today’s regime complex of online content governance that reflects a plurality of regulatory approaches.⁶²\n\nThird, we should be careful to acknowledge that the plurality of regulatory approaches to Internet governance has involved the selective, rather than absolute, absence of international law. For example, while opposing ITU involvement in Internet governance, the United States supported application of World Intellectual Property Organization treaties to the Internet and the adoption of World Trade Organization decisions implicating the cyber domain.⁶³\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

In Internet governance, reactive State silence played a stabilizing role that reinforced particular power dynamics. The United States, its allies, and its ‘Big Tech’ companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) flourished under the extant multistakeholder model and preferred its evolution over any ITU substitution. In contrast, States that spoke out were the disrupters, seeking to supplant the ICANN model in favour of a statist vision of Internet governance. In this dynamic, the act of refusing to break silence (e.g., by ratifying a new treaty or endorsing an ITU role) was not only an act of power, but signalled a priority to one collective grouping of States and stakeholders over another.\n\n## II. State Silence and State-Sponsored Cyber-operations\n\nAs States gained interest in the architecture by which the Internet operates, they also become interested in how they might employ it for political, military, and intelligence purposes. ICTs offered States a way to operate quickly and (relatively) cheaply on a global scale. They could do so, moreover, both secretly and covertly – the technology affords anonymity to most actors who want it with technical attribution of responsibility to a particular computer system difficult, to say nothing of ascribing responsibility to a human operator or those who direct them. States have taken advantage of these features to conduct various offensive ‘cyber-operations’, including: (i) cyber-attacks that disrupt or disable the availability or integrity of computer systems, networks, or the infrastructure they\n\n⁶⁴ Zalnieriute, supra note 63, at 63-65; see also Henning Lahmann, On the Politics and Ideologies of the Sovereignty Discourse in Cyberspace, 32 DUKE J.

Importantly, neither secrecy nor covertness are uniform concepts. It is important, for example, to differentiate deep and shallow secret cyber-operations.⁶⁸ Deep secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence is not yet publicly known. Shallow secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence becomes publicly known – for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or other actors' detection – but whose content remains obscured.⁶⁹ In addition, a distinction may be drawn between non-covert, covert, and quasi-covert cyber-operations.⁷⁰ Non-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State officially acknowledged by the acting State. Covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are officially unacknowledged by the acting State. Quasi-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are either acknowledged in part, acknowledged at some point after taking place, or reported and hypothetically justified without official acknowledgements by the acting State.\n\nCyber-operations are, by design, almost always meant to occur unobserved, and, if observed, be unattributable to, or at least unacknowledged\n\n⁶⁶ See, e.g., Herbert Lin &amp; Jackie Kerr, On Cyber-Enabled Information/Influence Warfare and Manipulation, in P.

Deep secret cyber-operations thus raise a cyber version of the proverbial question of whether a tree that falls in the forest makes a sound when there is no one there to hear it? If a cyber-operation never comes to light, we might characterize the silence that accompanies it as non-reactive – to use the language of the ILC, it is difficult to see how a State could be characterised as being ‘in a position to react’ to a cyber-operation where the State lacks ‘knowledge’ of it.71 Still, there are intermediate postures between entirely unknown cyber behaviours and public and acknowledged acts where a potential for reactions (and thus, reactive silences) arise. A State may be able to observe (or believe it knows of) another State’s covert cyber-operation and decline to respond.\n\nAt the same time, surveying State silences in response to hostile cyber-operations that have become publicly known to date, we see value in expanding the scope of State reactions beyond such cases of complete silence (where a State offers no responsive speech, behaviour, or engagement). Secret and covert cyber-operations have highlighted the potential for what we call partial silence—explicit State speech, behaviour, or engagements in response to a cyber-operation, which is silent either with respect to international law in general or as to the specific norms of international law implicated.72\n\nAn example of complete silence is Iran’s initial response to the Stuxnet cyber-operation. When its centrifuges began spinning out of control in 2008, Iran had no reaction, apparently on the assumption that the failure stemmed from internal operating problems rather than external causes.73 It took years for Iran to break its complete silence by characterising the incident as a ‘massive cyber-attack’ and accusing the US and Israel of deploying the malicious computer worm, albeit without any suggestion that it was an internationally wrongful act.74\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

For example, the only US public response to the 2014-2015 massive data theft from the Office of Personnel Management was admiration – James Clapper, then-head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, remarked that ‘you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did’.76\n\nOther times, States have condemned the behaviour of other States whilst remaining silent as to the incident’s characterisation under international law. US Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, suggested that the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated North Korea’s ‘flagrant disregard for international norms’,77 while US President Obama similarly avoided international law language in characterising Russia’s cyber information operation on the 2016 US presidential election as a ‘violation of established norms of behaviour’.78 These partial silences persist even where condemnations take a coordinated form. For instance, in response to the 2017 spread of WannaCry malware (which disrupted the functioning of hundreds of thousands of computers across over 150 States), the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing the cyber-attack to North Korea and condemning its behaviour without mentioning international law at all.79\n\nthat Iran had detected a planned “massive cyber-attack” against its nuclear facilities, blaming the United States, Israel and Britain’).\n\n75 See Martha Finnemore and Duncan B.

Why have States been so reticent to invoke the vocabulary of international law or assess any legal salience in their silences?\n\nOne possibility may be that victim States assume the secret and/or covert nature of hostile cyber-operations negates their characterisation as a practice that calls for a reaction. While the development of international law generally occurs through the practice of a few ‘movers and shakers’ in combination with the reactive silence of a larger number of passive States,⁸⁶ not all reactive State silences are legally salient.⁸⁷ Here, it may be significant that there has generally been silence accompanying the hostile cyber-operations themselves, whether in their secrecy (which ‘may obscure the practice itself, or any related, internally held opinio juris’) or their covertness, (where even if the acts become a shallow secret—publicly known, for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or detection by other actors—acting States uniformly decline to acknowledge their authorship).⁸⁸\n\nIt is commonly asserted that State acts must be public to qualify as state practice.⁸⁹ According to the International Law Association’s (ILA) Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, for example, ‘a secret physical act [...] is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tried to assert that its conduct was legally justified’.⁹⁰ This suggests that a State conducting cyber-operations that remain deep secrets or, if discovered, remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by the State alleged to have conducted it), will ‘cede its voice and weight of its practice in the development of the law’.⁹¹ In other\n\n⁸⁶ M.

And if there’s no legally relevant practice, there is nothing to which the victim State must respond (whether via acquiescence or in opposition). Under this approach, reactive silences would only have legal effects if the accused State itself attempted to acknowledge its behaviour (a move that has yet to occur in cyberspace as States rarely, if ever, explicitly acknowledge specific cyber-operations as their own).⁹²\n\nWhatever the strength of such logic, the fact that States have yet to express it leaves open the possibility that other actors may assign legal salience to their reactive silences, even those that are partial in nature. The ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification, for example, suggest that for practice to contribute to the formation and identification of customary international law, it is sufficient for it to ‘be known to other States (whether or not it is publicly available)’, adding that ‘it is difficult to see how confidential conduct by a State could serve such a purpose unless and until it is known to other States’.⁹³ Similarly, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law claims that ‘in order to count, practice has to be public or communicated to some extent’, a requirement that can be fulfilled once the practice is ‘communicated to one other State or relevant international organization including the ICRC’, even communications made to the ICRC in confidence.⁹⁴ On this view, for secret and/or covert cyber-operations to constitute conditions calling for a reaction it may suffice for them to ‘be known to other States’, even if they remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by States alleged to have conducted them).⁹⁵\n\nFrom this perspective, there follows the possibility of investing legal salience in a State’s reactive silence to at least some types of secret or covert cyber-operations. For instance, a complete reactive silence to a shallow secret operation could be deemed acceptance based on the ILC’s endorsement of the idea that practices may be deemed evidence of opinio juris where it represents\n\n⁹² BUCHAN, supra note 91, at 154, 164.

Whether or not States currently condemn hostile cyber accusations in explicitly legal terms, can signalling disapproval of such acts (as US President Biden did recently with respect to Chinese cyber-espionage⁹⁷) counter-act claims the accused State’s operations are (or are becoming) permitted by international law—in other words, counter-act any notion that such practices are being tolerated?\n\nAlternatively, individual reactive partial silences might accumulate in scale over time to generate what is deemed to be a de facto collective acceptance of the practice of various cyber-operations. In other words, if States’ usage over time continuously denounces cyber-operations as unwanted but not internationally unlawful, might States at some point infer international law does not prohibit such acts—or at the least, transform a ‘real rule’ of international law into a ‘paper rule’.⁹⁸ Under this reasoning, partial silences would be read literally, suggesting the underlying behaviour is, as the colloquial saying goes, ‘awful but lawful’. According to Perina, for example, ‘[s]hallowly secret covert activity that is tolerated by the international community encourages in both the covert actors and third States the practice of covert behavior, as it confirms that the political costs of covertness are low’.⁹⁹\n\nSuch a view aligns with those who view espionage as either a lawful exception to otherwise unlawful acts or outside international law’s purview entirely (especially where victim States consistently object to espionage on political grounds or claim violations of national laws without international legal objections). The US Department of Defense General Counsel’s 2020 statement suggests such reasoning, rejecting the idea that sovereignty always functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace given so many States’ complete or partially silent reactions to countless cases of publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks.¹⁰⁰ This view might, of course, be characterized as giving international law a permissive content as to State sponsored cyber-operations.\n\n⁹⁶ See supra note 10 and accompanying text.\n⁹⁷ See White House Press Release, supra note 79.\n⁹⁸ Perina, supra note 15, at 576 (citing Michael J Glennon, How International Rules Die, 93 GEORGETOWN L.

Such ambiguity counsels States to clarify how their silences should be understood in different circumstances to mitigate the possibility of other actors misconstruing and assigning meaning to them. In doing so, however, we must recognize the challenge of agency. Assigning any legal salience to silence, whether as acceptance or not, risks marginalizing those States prone to silence, not because of any legal position, but because they may lack the time, knowledge, or capabilities to determine how best to legally characterise hostile cyber-operations, to say nothing of State interests in avoiding engagements that may trigger involvements with opposing hegemonic actors.¹⁰²\n\n## III. State Silences and State Statements on the Application of International Law to Cyber-operations\n\nSo far, we have assumed at least some international legal regulation of State-sponsored cyber-operations.

For those who insist that generally applicable international law rules already bind States in cyberspace, it might follow that these statements have no salience. Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita Dias, for example, emphasize that\n\nInternational legal rules or principles of general applicability, i.e., applicable under general international law to all types of state activity in the relevant circumstances, such as the prohibition on the use of force, non-intervention, the Corfu Channel rule of 'due diligence', international human rights law and international humanitarian law, thus, do not need further proof of applicability to ICTs or other new technologies via specific state practice and opinio juris 'in cyberspace'. Their scope is sufficiently broad to be interpreted and applied to ICTs. It is the burden of those advocating for ICTs' exclusion from their scope to present evidence that states, in their general practice accepted as law, have actively carved out ICTs.¹⁴\n\nTaking this view one step further, it might be possible to reason that State statements about international law applications are not a constitutive element of customary international law online; and if that is the case, reactive silence to such statements similarly lacks legal salience.\n\nFor some, however, cyberspace's novelties require States to elaborate new state practice and opinio juris before ascribing legal obligations to States. Consider the views of Israel's Deputy Attorney General:\n\nIt cannot be automatically presumed that a customary rule applicable in any of the physical domains is also applicable to the cyber domain. The key question in identifying State practice is whether the practice which arose in other domains is closely related to the activity envisaged in the cyber domain. Additionally, it must be ascertained that the opinio juris which gave rise to the customary rules applicable in other domains was not domain-specific. Given the unique characteristics of the cyber domain, such an analysis is to be made with particular prudence, as it is very often the case that relevant differences exist.\n\nFor supporters of the domain-specific approach, State statements have value as opinio juris, begging the question if they therefore qualify as circumstances calling for a reaction?\n\n¹³ States have, however, been more vocal in accepting international institutional views on the applicability of international law.

As Kevin Heller explains, even if silence as consent is controversial, ‘there seems to be widespread acceptance of the idea that specially-affected states, unlike states that are not specially affected, have an obligation to object to a claim concerning the customary status of a practice—and that their silence should be considered support if they do not’.¹¹⁷\n\nThere are, however, countervailing possibilities.

Big data and machine learning may someday lessen these constraints and equalize state capacities, but those days have yet to arrive.¹²¹ Today, drawing inferences from State silence more likely implicates the agency issues raised above; requiring States to speak out (whether to endorse or oppose other States' statements) involves a political act that would mostly just affirm the power of the States speaking.\n\nWhatever the legal salience of the ‘reactive’ silence States have offered other States’ statements, it would be a mistake to ignore the silence evident in the more than 150 States who have yet to affirmatively offer their own views on how international law applies in cyberspace.

Stymied over how to articulate international law applications in cyberspace, a 2015 UN GGE identified eleven non-binding ‘voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour’.¹²⁶ These norms purport to establish shared expectations of appropriate future behaviour in cyberspace that do not depend on law to establish their logic of appropriateness.¹²⁷ The precise relationship between these norm promotion efforts and international law is unclear. The 2021 OEWG report clarified these ‘norms do not replace or alter States’ obligations or rights under international law, which are binding, but rather provide additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs’, whilst also noting these ‘[n]orms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law’.¹²⁸ The fact remains, however, that subsequent state endorsements of these norms are often partially silent – they do not address whether and which voluntary norms codify pre-existing international legal rules and standards.¹²⁹\n\nIV.

As such, we lack requisite evidence to address many of this volume's research questions.¹³⁰ We do not know if the work of non-State actors (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals) or institutional fora (e.g., UN GGE reports) call for a reaction by States, nor whether a legal (viz. a political) claim is necessary to do so. Without recognition of the existence of reactive silences, let alone their thresholds, we have little to say about questions of consistency for purposes of law-production or if the technologies that ICTs represent can impact findings of acquiescence or non-acceptance.\n\nOn closer examination, however, cyberspace may inform our understanding of State silences in at least three ways. First and foremost, it highlights the importance of distinguishing international legal rhetoric about silence from the fact of its existence. Even if States and other stakeholders have yet to acknowledge it explicitly, our case studies of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law reveal an array of contexts where States have reacted with silence to the claims or conduct of others. Identifying these instances of silence opens the door to the very sorts of interpretations and interactions that have evolved reactive silence in other legal fields. We thus see our chapter as a modest, opening move – an invitation to others to identify and examine incidents of reactive silence in cyberspace and to assess whether they have legal salience, and, if so, whether, when and how they might constitute acceptance, non-acceptance, or opposition.\n\nSecond, the very inattention reactive silence has received in addressing international law and cyberspace warrants attention. It may, of course, be simply a feature of the field's immaturity that will gradually resolve over time. On the other hand, there may be certain contextual conditions in cyberspace whose existence obstructs any role for reactive silence. Hence, in opening the door to discuss State silences in cyberspace, we also invite consideration of whether and which conditions explain the current silence on State silence.\n\nConsider, for example, questions of clarity about the existence and meaning of international law itself. Might legal salience for reactive silence require some baseline consensus about what international laws exist or mean in the cyber context before we can assume anything about ensuing silences? Similarly, our discussion of secret and/or covert cyber-operations suggests that reactive silence may depend on some measure of transparency – acknowledged or at least known conduct to which others may react. Does the fact that the underlying behaviour is itself conducted in silence restrict international law's ability to assign value to any reactions, including silence? But even if we could make State behaviours in cyberspace more transparent, questions remain about each State's capacity to\n\n¹³⁰ See Ch. 1, at xx-xx.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

At present, cyberspace is rife with capacity questions as the vast majority of States lack sufficient understanding of ICTs as a technical matter, leaving them behind or outside the conduct and conversations of more tech-savvy actors. Assigning silences legal salience in such contexts may not only be difficult but normatively questionable if it enables a form of legal imperialism by those with the most capability to act at the expense of most States who are targeted and/or victimized by other States' behaviour online. The ICT context also suggests that the status quo's susceptibility to change may impact recognition of reactive silences. Given the Internet's dynamic nature, with ICTs constantly evolving (and with them the means and methods by which States operate), it may be difficult to ascribe legal value to responses, silent or otherwise, especially, if at the time, the underlying claims or conduct quickly become outdated or obsolete.\n\nMore research is needed to assess if clarity, transparency, capability, and/or susceptibility help explain the current silence about State silence in cyberspace. In doing so, we would also invite assessments of whether these conditions may have explanatory value for the state of reactive silence in other areas of international law. Our list is not, however, in any way exhaustive – we would expect that in cyberspace as in other contexts, additional conditions may impact or control reactive silence's contours and contents.\n\nThird, whatever roles reactive silence occupies in cyberspace, our treatments of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law suggest the utility of additional perspectives on silences. Our treatment has highlighted two – (i) partial silences where silence is broken in reaction to some conduct or claims but silence about international law itself remains; and (ii) catalysing silences where the absence of claims or conduct involving international law trigger or otherwise facilitate non-international legal institutions (e.g., multistakeholder governance models like ICANN) or norms (e.g., the UN GGE's 11 voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour). State silence may also facilitate non-State actor voices within international law (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals).\n\nAt present, moreover, we believe both partial and catalysing silences have a much larger impact on the construction of international law in cyberspace than reactive silence. As such, we would call for more attention to these silences across international law more generally to see what impacts, if any, they have had on the law's formation, operation, or efficacy.\n\nState silence may have been a feature of the early Internet, impacting its evolution and, in turn, the availability of international law and international\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

Rather than diminishing the importance of State silence, however, these voices (and their identities) demand more attention to the legal salience and implications of the silence that remains. Thus, the time is ripe for States to begin to talk about their silence in cyberspace. States and scholars now need to understand when silence can reinforce, rather than undermine, the regulation of the Internet as an open, stable, and secure space for human flourishing and peaceful coexistence among States.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

HOLLIS\nBARRIE SANDER\nCyberspace¹ emerged amidst State silence.² Although one State—the United States—played a key role in funding the information and communication technologies (ICTs) that evolved into the modern Internet, it was largely developed by university academics and, later, commercial enterprises.³ There was little input from other States, who were unaware—or uninterested—in the nascent technology and its potential risks and rewards.⁴\nSuch silence stands in contrast to the prevalence of States' verbal and physical acts in and about cyberspace today. Cyberspace's rising priority along humanitarian, economic, political, and military lines has spawned an array of\n¹ A socio-technical institution, cyberspace involves a multi-layered assemblage of hardware, software, and networks that store and exchange data, including chiefly the Internet. Various ways exist to describe these layers. The bottom 'link' layer includes the physical hardware/media used to access the Internet. The next three layers involve coding – 'network' and 'transport' layers break data into packets and route them between networks. An 'applications' layer converts the routed data into useful things like files, videos, and web sites. On top of these coded layers, a final 'content' layer comprises all information shared across ICTs. Each layer functions independently; at the application layer, for example, Google Chrome works regardless of whether the link layer employs DSL or 5G.

Much of this behaviour has implications for the international legal order as States now regularly participate in the governance of cyberspace (i.e., regulating the Internet's technical architecture) and governance in cyberspace (i.e., delineating what behaviours to prohibit, permit, or require). As States speak out more, however, it begs a question: what are the implications of international law for the State silence that remains?\nThe particular conception of State silence that forms the focus of this volume is 'reactive State silence' – the absence of physical or verbal acts of a State against the background of someone else's conduct or claim.5 As this volume's introductory chapter notes, reactive State silence may be legally significant in at least three ways: acceptance, iterating the formation or evolution of international law via concepts like acquiescence;6 lack of acceptance, for example indicating that there is no international agreement;7 or opposition, in the sense of resisting the formation or evolution of international law, for example abstaining from ratifying a treaty or voting in the United Nations General Assembly as evidence of a State's resistance to the formation of a customary rule.8\nThe International Law Commission (ILC)'s work on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice suggests silence may constitute 'acceptance ... when the circumstances call for some reaction'.9 Conclusion 10(3) of the ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification elaborates that '[f]ailure to react over time to a practice may serve as evidence of acceptance as law (opinio juris), provided that States were in a position to react and the circumstances called for some reaction'.10 The accompanying ILC commentary delimits circumstances calling for a reaction 'where the practice is one that affects – usually unfavourably – the interests or rights of the State failing or refusing to act'.11 According to the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nILC being ‘in a position to react’ means that ‘the State concerned must have had knowledge of the practice (which includes circumstances where, because of the publicity given to the practice, it must be assumed that the State had such knowledge)’ and that ‘it must have had sufficient time and ability to act’.¹² As such, the ILC concludes that ‘[w]here a State did not or could not have been expected to know of a certain practice, or has not yet had a reasonable time to respond, inaction cannot be attributed to an acknowledgement that such practice was mandated (or permitted) under customary international law’.¹³ The present volume centres on surfacing how States and other actors across different fields of international law understand and apply these abstract and context-independent thresholds.\nIn the cyber domain, however, the concept of reactive silence has been itself met with silence. States, courts, and other actors have had virtually (in both senses of the term) nothing to say about these thresholds specifically, or the potential legal salience of reactive State silence generally. The principal exception to this trend is a 2020 statement by the US Department of Defense General Counsel reflecting on whether sovereignty functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace; he suggested that ‘many States’ public silence in the face of countless publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks precludes a conclusion that States have coalesced around a common view that there is an international prohibition against all such operations ...’.¹⁴ Aside from this (brief) remark, we see little mention of any types of circumstances that call for another State’s reaction in the cyber domain, the meaning of a State’s capacity to react in this context, the threshold of knowledge of another State’s practice, or what amounts to a reasonable passage of time to respond.\nAgainst this background, our chapter offers an inaugural assessment of how reactive silence implicates international law-making in cyberspace. We do so through both descriptive and normative lenses. First, as a descriptive matter, we differentiate the absence of reactive silence rhetoric in international law from its factual existence in various contexts. We introduce three cases – (i) Internet governance, (ii) secret/covert State sponsored cyber-operations; and (iii) unilateral statements by States about international law in cyberspace – where we can identify reactive State silences and offer tentative thoughts on their legal\n¹² Id.

Doing so, in turn, provides a foundation for analysing why States and other stakeholders have yet to recognize reactive silence issues in cyber contexts.\nSecond, extant ambiguity about reactive State silence in cyberspace provides grounds for a normative claim: beyond reactive silences, international law would benefit from acknowledging other manifestations of State silence – which we label catalysing and partial silences – to assess international law and cyberspace. Catalysing silence involves the absence of verbal and/or physical acts of States – whether reactive or not – that empower alternative regulatory forms (e.g., voluntary non-binding norms) or authorities (e.g., non-State actor voices about international law). Partial silence involves instances where there is some verbal/physical State response to a claim or conduct (thereby disqualifying it as a ‘reactive silence’) but that reaction remains silent on all relevant international law implications. Like reactive silence, partial silence raises questions of legal salience in terms of acceptance, non-acceptance, and opposition. Thus, we aim to launch a conversation about the capacities and constraints of reactive silence to construct international law in cyberspace while offering additional frames for assessing State silence’s salience to international law overall.\nOur chapter proceeds in four parts. We begin with State silence’s role in the Internet governance context, where it generally catalysed ‘multistakeholder’ governance, with its reactive forms exhibiting acceptance by certain States of that model and opposition to other States’ attempts to supplant it with more conventional (i.e., multilateral) international legal frameworks. (I) Next, we turn to State silence vis-a-vis the rising number of State-sponsored cyber-operations, whose secret and/or covert nature may explain both their popularity and why States are reluctant to catalog them as State practices that constitute circumstances calling for a reaction under international law. (II) In this context, we explore whether partial silences in response to such operations have their own legal salience in terms of avoiding the international environment’s ‘default permissive condition’.¹⁵ We then turn to a new trend where certain States have begun to offer unilateral statements on how international law applies to cyberspace, asking if a State’s reactive silence to such statements (or the failure to publicize its own views) have legal salience to international-law making and who authors it. (III)\nThese case studies lead us to conclude that, although the cyber context may have little to say about reactive State silence and international law at present, the inattention to this topic itself suggests conditions that may implicate whether and when reactive silences garner legal salience: (i) clarity about the relevant legal\n¹⁵ Alexandra Perina, *Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law*, 53 COLUMB.

TRANSNAT’L L. 507, 576 (2015).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nrules; (ii) transparency about relevant State behaviour; (iii) capability in terms of understanding the underlying claims or conduct; and (iv) susceptibility for circumstances to change rapidly. (IV) Given cyberspace’s status quo, we close with a call for more States to break their silence not only on how international law applies to the cyber domain, but also how to construe any remaining State silences that follow.\n## I. State Silence and Internet Governance\nInternet governance encompasses ‘the design and administration of the technologies necessary to keep the Internet operational and the enactment of substantive policy around these technologies’.¹⁶ It is not ‘a monolithic system’ but ‘a multi-layered system of administration and operational oversight that spans areas as diverse as standards-setting, cybersecurity, and inter-connection arrangements’.¹⁷ At first, most States greeted this topic with silence. Whether out of ignorance or disinterest, most States did not engage with, or even speak about, the Internet’s governing institutions, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which was founded in 1986 and is comprised to this day by technical experts.¹⁸\nIn contrast to most States, the United States was never completely silent about Internet governance. In 1998, building off its early funding, the U.S. Department of Commerce solicited proposals for an institution to regulate the Internet’s naming and numbering system.¹⁹ The winning candidate was a non-profit entity based in Los Angeles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), that proposed to operate the system via ‘multi-stakeholder governance’ where individuals, non-commercial stakeholder groups, industry, and governments would offer inputs on a community-based, consensus\n¹⁶ LAURA DENARDIS, THE GLOBAL WAR FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE (Yale University Press 2014), at 6.\n¹⁷ Id., at 226.\n¹⁸ The IETF is responsible for designating technical standards and protocols by which the Internet operates. IETF, Missions and Principles, at https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/.\n¹⁹ Common, shared standards and protocols are necessary for connections to occur among today’s billions of digital devices and thousands of networks. For example, the servers used to send and receive things like e-mail each have an Internet protocol (IP) address while each e-mail address has a ‘domain’ name including top-level domains like .com or .edu and then second-level domains; hence, each university has a second-level domain under the top-level .edu domain (e.g., temple.edu). For this system to work, there must be a coordinated effort to distribute and track IP addresses, assign domain names, and oversee protocol parameter identifiers that are used by Internet standards.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ndriven approach.²⁰ ICANN’s emergence is significant for reflecting on State silence in the cyber domain because, as Milton Mueller explains, ‘ICANN’s original institutional design marked a revolutionary departure from traditional approaches to global governance’ providing ‘one of the few globally centralized points of control over the Internet’.²¹ Its mode of governance may be understood as a form of privatization which ‘significantly reduced the power of national governments and existing intergovernmental organizations over communication and information policy’.²² According to the The Economist, for example, ICANN amounted to a ‘completely new institutional animal [...] a hybrid between an online community and a real-world governance structure, an untested combination [...]: an industry trying to regulate part of itself, across the globe, with little or no input from national governments’.²³ At the same time, as Goldsmith and Wu explain, ICANN remained legally under contract to the US Department of Commerce, which had delegated the day-to-day management of Internet naming and numbering decisions to the organisation.²⁴ Thus, ‘ICANN’s spirit of ‘self-regulation’ was an appealing label for a process that could be more accurately described as the U.S. government brokering a behind-the-scenes deal that best suited its policy preferences [...] to ensure the stability of the Internet, to fend off the regulatory efforts of foreign governments and international organisations, and to maintain ultimate control’.²⁵\nICANN’s establishment can best be characterized as producing reactive silence among States. To be clear, States were not completely silent; in word and deed, they accepted – some more reluctantly than others²⁶ – ICANN’s authority to govern the Internet’s naming and numbering function pursuant to U.S. domestic law (in addition to its Department of Commerce contract, ICANN was\n20 Memorandum of Understanding Between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Sept. 30, 2000), at https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/1998/memorandum-understanding-between-us-department-commerce-and-internet-corporation-assigned-.\n21 MILTON L.

Yet, when it came to rhetoric about international law or engagement with international legal institutions, many States remained silent. Although neither States nor commentators have reflected on the precise meaning of this reactive silence, in practice it inescapably amounted to State toleration of an approach to Internet governance that did not directly involve international law.\nStates' initial toleration of ICANN was periodically subject to disruption as 'sovereigns outside the United States perceived it as a threat to their authority'.[27] Three such efforts – and the reactive silence they generated – warrant attention here. An initial disruption period occurred during the UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) – a multilateral series of diplomatic conferences between 2002 and 2005 that sought to address a diversity of issues related to the information society, but which ultimately morphed into a 'battle over the soul of the Internet'.[28] According to Mueller, WSIS witnessed 'a collision between those who saw national governments as the proper agents for defining and implementing international communication and information policy, and those who pursued a more open, pluralistic, and transnational policy-making framework'.[29] For example, China, with the support of a number of Global South countries, proposed to establish an international Internet organisation and adoption of an Internet treaty.[30] Then, before WSIS's second phase in 2005, the United States back-tracked on promises it had made in 1998 to relinquish authority over ICANN (and the 'root' server that executed its naming and numbering functions) in 2006.[31] The European Union responded by proposing that the governance over the domain name system be shifted from ICANN to a UN-affiliated intergovernmental group.[32] Neither the Chinese nor EU proposals succeeded, but they resulted in a compromise where the US and ICANN retained authority over domain names and numbers, but a new Internet Governance Forum was established where States could offer and discuss recommendations concerning Internet policy.[33]\nThe past decade witnessed a second disruptive period as other States and stakeholders revived complaints about U.S. final authority over ICANN and its\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nmultistakeholder approach to Internet governance. The differences had deep conceptual underpinnings over whether cyberspace is a 'space' warranting autonomous regulation or a 'technology' that can be regulated by sovereign nations or the international organizations they create.³⁴ Supporting the latter frame, States like China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) sought to legitimize a broad statist approach to Internet governance with both technical and content governance dimensions.³⁵ In terms of technical regulation, these States called for a multilateral organization – the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) – to displace the multistakeholder model of governance embodied by ICANN. In terms of content regulation, under the banner of 'information security' these States sought to legitimize their efforts to monitor and suppress online forms of expression they viewed as a security threat, including expressions of internal dissent and anti-government content.³⁶ For example, in 2009 the SCO adopted an agreement that defined 'information war' in broad terms as 'dissemination of information harmful to political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other States'.³⁷\nBoth the technical and content regulation dimensions of the statist vision for Internet governance were embodied in a draft 'Code of Conduct' that China, Russia and other members of the SCO submitted to the UN General Assembly in 2011³⁸ and again in revised form in early 2015.³⁹ As Eliza Watt notes, the Draft\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\n34 Scholars have long engaged in similar debates.

Through a multi-year process ending in 2016, the United States relinquished its contractual control over ICANN. In its place, ICANN’s stakeholders adopted a revamped, global, multi-stakeholder model of governance (albeit one still incorporated under California law).56\nThe Internet governance context offers four lessons for how we think about State silence generally and reactive State silence in particular. For starters, it contextualizes why there has been so little discussion of reactive State silence and international law in the cyber domain, namely, the absence of international legal mechanisms for governance generally. The emergence of the ICANN multistakeholder regulatory model led to situations where the effects of reactive State silence to both its establishment and attempts to supplant it were so self-evident as to not merit comment. Here, State silence in reaction to ICANN’s emergence inevitably amounted to acceptance (albeit not of the formation or evolution of international law per se), tolerating regulation outside national and multilateral legal structures. At the same time, State silence in reaction to the Draft Codes and the revised ITRs inescapably constituted lack of acceptance or opposition to attempts to supplant the extant multistakeholder model with specific forms of international legal governance.\nSecond, the Internet governance context suggests a need to broaden the backdrop against which international lawyers evaluate State silence. Most existing scholarship has considered ‘reactive’ silence in endogenous terms, examining how State silence impacts obligations or institutions in existing and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nacknowledged international legal regimes. The story of Internet governance highlights an exogenous ‘catalysing’ form of State silence. Instead of impacting international law’s contents, here State silence catalyses the contraction of its contours, fostering or supporting other regulatory models, whether the original U.S. national legal authorities or the current multistakeholder framework.\nMoreover, State silences in response to the Draft Codes also arguably had a catalysing effect. In particular, State silences on Internet governance frameworks both reflected—and to some extent created—space for other regulatory models to take hold, including: (i) private forms of governance (for example, content moderation rules and practices developed by social media companies like Facebook⁵⁷), (ii) non-binding voluntary norms (for example, the Christchurch Call⁵⁸), (iii) regional human rights law (for example, those focused on the permissibility of different models of intermediary liability frameworks⁵⁹), (iv) negotiations for regional regulations (for example, the European Union’s Digital Services Act package and General Data Protection Regulation⁶⁰), and (v) domestic law (for example, intermediary liability laws and constitutional law⁶¹). The result is today’s regime complex of online content governance that reflects a plurality of regulatory approaches.⁶²\nThird, we should be careful to acknowledge that the plurality of regulatory approaches to Internet governance has involved the selective, rather than absolute, absence of international law. For example, while opposing ITU involvement in Internet governance, the United States supported application of World Intellectual Property Organization treaties to the Internet and the adoption of World Trade Organization decisions implicating the cyber domain.⁶³\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIndeed, through these international legal regimes the United States – together with US technology giants such as Google and Facebook – consolidated a neoliberal model of Internet governance, one with greater emphasis on intellectual property protection, the ‘free flow of information doctrine’, and the collection and monetization of personal data for profit, rather than, for example, data protection and privacy.⁶⁴ Similarly, the demise of the Draft Codes did not mean a law-free zone for Internet governance given extant international law regimes empowering State efforts to regulate speech domestically (e.g., prescriptive jurisdiction) or to cabin when and how they may do so (e.g., international human rights provisions on freedom of expression).⁶⁵\nFinally, divisions amongst States highlight the importance of the political context to the interplay among speech acts and silence. In Internet governance, reactive State silence played a stabilizing role that reinforced particular power dynamics. The United States, its allies, and its ‘Big Tech’ companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) flourished under the extant multistakeholder model and preferred its evolution over any ITU substitution. In contrast, States that spoke out were the disrupters, seeking to supplant the ICANN model in favour of a statist vision of Internet governance. In this dynamic, the act of refusing to break silence (e.g., by ratifying a new treaty or endorsing an ITU role) was not only an act of power, but signalled a priority to one collective grouping of States and stakeholders over another.\n## II. State Silence and State-Sponsored Cyber-operations\nAs States gained interest in the architecture by which the Internet operates, they also become interested in how they might employ it for political, military, and intelligence purposes. ICTs offered States a way to operate quickly and (relatively) cheaply on a global scale. They could do so, moreover, both secretly and covertly – the technology affords anonymity to most actors who want it with technical attribution of responsibility to a particular computer system difficult, to say nothing of ascribing responsibility to a human operator or those who direct them. States have taken advantage of these features to conduct various offensive ‘cyber-operations’, including: (i) cyber-attacks that disrupt or disable the availability or integrity of computer systems, networks, or the infrastructure they\n⁶⁴ Zalnieriute, supra note 63, at 63-65; see also Henning Lahmann, On the Politics and Ideologies of the Sovereignty Discourse in Cyberspace, 32 DUKE J.

Importantly, neither secrecy nor covertness are uniform concepts. It is important, for example, to differentiate deep and shallow secret cyber-operations.⁶⁸ Deep secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence is not yet publicly known. Shallow secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence becomes publicly known – for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or other actors' detection – but whose content remains obscured.⁶⁹ In addition, a distinction may be drawn between non-covert, covert, and quasi-covert cyber-operations.⁷⁰ Non-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State officially acknowledged by the acting State. Covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are officially unacknowledged by the acting State. Quasi-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are either acknowledged in part, acknowledged at some point after taking place, or reported and hypothetically justified without official acknowledgements by the acting State.\nCyber-operations are, by design, almost always meant to occur unobserved, and, if observed, be unattributable to, or at least unacknowledged\n⁶⁶ See, e.g., Herbert Lin &amp; Jackie Kerr, On Cyber-Enabled Information/Influence Warfare and Manipulation, in P.

Deep secret cyber-operations thus raise a cyber version of the proverbial question of whether a tree that falls in the forest makes a sound when there is no one there to hear it? If a cyber-operation never comes to light, we might characterize the silence that accompanies it as non-reactive – to use the language of the ILC, it is difficult to see how a State could be characterised as being ‘in a position to react’ to a cyber-operation where the State lacks ‘knowledge’ of it.71 Still, there are intermediate postures between entirely unknown cyber behaviours and public and acknowledged acts where a potential for reactions (and thus, reactive silences) arise. A State may be able to observe (or believe it knows of) another State’s covert cyber-operation and decline to respond.\nAt the same time, surveying State silences in response to hostile cyber-operations that have become publicly known to date, we see value in expanding the scope of State reactions beyond such cases of complete silence (where a State offers no responsive speech, behaviour, or engagement). Secret and covert cyber-operations have highlighted the potential for what we call partial silence—explicit State speech, behaviour, or engagements in response to a cyber-operation, which is silent either with respect to international law in general or as to the specific norms of international law implicated.72\nAn example of complete silence is Iran’s initial response to the Stuxnet cyber-operation. When its centrifuges began spinning out of control in 2008, Iran had no reaction, apparently on the assumption that the failure stemmed from internal operating problems rather than external causes.73 It took years for Iran to break its complete silence by characterising the incident as a ‘massive cyber-attack’ and accusing the US and Israel of deploying the malicious computer worm, albeit without any suggestion that it was an internationally wrongful act.74\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn recent years, such a partial silence in response to hostile cyber-operations has become increasingly common.75 Sometimes, States have responded by publicly attributing cyber-operations to other States without condemnation. For example, the only US public response to the 2014-2015 massive data theft from the Office of Personnel Management was admiration – James Clapper, then-head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, remarked that ‘you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did’.76\nOther times, States have condemned the behaviour of other States whilst remaining silent as to the incident’s characterisation under international law. US Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, suggested that the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated North Korea’s ‘flagrant disregard for international norms’,77 while US President Obama similarly avoided international law language in characterising Russia’s cyber information operation on the 2016 US presidential election as a ‘violation of established norms of behaviour’.78 These partial silences persist even where condemnations take a coordinated form. For instance, in response to the 2017 spread of WannaCry malware (which disrupted the functioning of hundreds of thousands of computers across over 150 States), the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing the cyber-attack to North Korea and condemning its behaviour without mentioning international law at all.79\nthat Iran had detected a planned “massive cyber-attack” against its nuclear facilities, blaming the United States, Israel and Britain’).\n75 See Martha Finnemore and Duncan B.

In October 2018, the UK and its allies exposed and condemned a series of cyber-operations conducted by the Russian military intelligence service against political institutions, businesses, media outlets, and an international sports agency.⁸⁰ The UK Foreign Secretary suggested that ‘this pattern of behaviour demonstrates [Russia’s] desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences’.⁸¹ The Netherlands suggested these activities ‘undermine the international rule of law’,⁸² while Canada’s statement made clear that Russia’s malicious cyber activities ‘demonstrate a disregard for international law and undermine the rules-based international order’.⁸³ None of these accusations delineated whether all of the GRU’s alleged operations violated international law or if only some did; nor did they elaborate which international laws were violated.⁸⁴\nIn short, both victim and third States are almost always completely or partially silent in response to hostile cyber-operations.

Why have States been so reticent to invoke the vocabulary of international law or assess any legal salience in their silences?\nOne possibility may be that victim States assume the secret and/or covert nature of hostile cyber-operations negates their characterisation as a practice that calls for a reaction. While the development of international law generally occurs through the practice of a few ‘movers and shakers’ in combination with the reactive silence of a larger number of passive States,⁸⁶ not all reactive State silences are legally salient.⁸⁷ Here, it may be significant that there has generally been silence accompanying the hostile cyber-operations themselves, whether in their secrecy (which ‘may obscure the practice itself, or any related, internally held opinio juris’) or their covertness, (where even if the acts become a shallow secret—publicly known, for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or detection by other actors—acting States uniformly decline to acknowledge their authorship).⁸⁸\nIt is commonly asserted that State acts must be public to qualify as state practice.⁸⁹ According to the International Law Association’s (ILA) Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, for example, ‘a secret physical act [...] is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tried to assert that its conduct was legally justified’.⁹⁰ This suggests that a State conducting cyber-operations that remain deep secrets or, if discovered, remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by the State alleged to have conducted it), will ‘cede its voice and weight of its practice in the development of the law’.⁹¹ In other\n⁸⁶ M.

And if there’s no legally relevant practice, there is nothing to which the victim State must respond (whether via acquiescence or in opposition). Under this approach, reactive silences would only have legal effects if the accused State itself attempted to acknowledge its behaviour (a move that has yet to occur in cyberspace as States rarely, if ever, explicitly acknowledge specific cyber-operations as their own).⁹²\nWhatever the strength of such logic, the fact that States have yet to express it leaves open the possibility that other actors may assign legal salience to their reactive silences, even those that are partial in nature. The ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification, for example, suggest that for practice to contribute to the formation and identification of customary international law, it is sufficient for it to ‘be known to other States (whether or not it is publicly available)’, adding that ‘it is difficult to see how confidential conduct by a State could serve such a purpose unless and until it is known to other States’.⁹³ Similarly, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law claims that ‘in order to count, practice has to be public or communicated to some extent’, a requirement that can be fulfilled once the practice is ‘communicated to one other State or relevant international organization including the ICRC’, even communications made to the ICRC in confidence.⁹⁴ On this view, for secret and/or covert cyber-operations to constitute conditions calling for a reaction it may suffice for them to ‘be known to other States’, even if they remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by States alleged to have conducted them).⁹⁵\nFrom this perspective, there follows the possibility of investing legal salience in a State’s reactive silence to at least some types of secret or covert cyber-operations. For instance, a complete reactive silence to a shallow secret operation could be deemed acceptance based on the ILC’s endorsement of the idea that practices may be deemed evidence of opinio juris where it represents\n⁹² BUCHAN, supra note 91, at 154, 164.

Whether or not States currently condemn hostile cyber accusations in explicitly legal terms, can signalling disapproval of such acts (as US President Biden did recently with respect to Chinese cyber-espionage⁹⁷) counter-act claims the accused State’s operations are (or are becoming) permitted by international law—in other words, counter-act any notion that such practices are being tolerated?\nAlternatively, individual reactive partial silences might accumulate in scale over time to generate what is deemed to be a de facto collective acceptance of the practice of various cyber-operations. In other words, if States’ usage over time continuously denounces cyber-operations as unwanted but not internationally unlawful, might States at some point infer international law does not prohibit such acts—or at the least, transform a ‘real rule’ of international law into a ‘paper rule’.⁹⁸ Under this reasoning, partial silences would be read literally, suggesting the underlying behaviour is, as the colloquial saying goes, ‘awful but lawful’. According to Perina, for example, ‘[s]hallowly secret covert activity that is tolerated by the international community encourages in both the covert actors and third States the practice of covert behavior, as it confirms that the political costs of covertness are low’.⁹⁹\nSuch a view aligns with those who view espionage as either a lawful exception to otherwise unlawful acts or outside international law’s purview entirely (especially where victim States consistently object to espionage on political grounds or claim violations of national laws without international legal objections). The US Department of Defense General Counsel’s 2020 statement suggests such reasoning, rejecting the idea that sovereignty always functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace given so many States’ complete or partially silent reactions to countless cases of publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks.¹⁰⁰ This view might, of course, be characterized as giving international law a permissive content as to State sponsored cyber-operations.\n⁹⁶ See supra note 10 and accompanying text.\n⁹⁷ See White House Press Release, supra note 79.\n⁹⁸ Perina, supra note 15, at 576 (citing Michael J Glennon, How International Rules Die, 93 GEORGETOWN L.

Such ambiguity counsels States to clarify how their silences should be understood in different circumstances to mitigate the possibility of other actors misconstruing and assigning meaning to them. In doing so, however, we must recognize the challenge of agency. Assigning any legal salience to silence, whether as acceptance or not, risks marginalizing those States prone to silence, not because of any legal position, but because they may lack the time, knowledge, or capabilities to determine how best to legally characterise hostile cyber-operations, to say nothing of State interests in avoiding engagements that may trigger involvements with opposing hegemonic actors.¹⁰²\n## III. State Silences and State Statements on the Application of International Law to Cyber-operations\nSo far, we have assumed at least some international legal regulation of State-sponsored cyber-operations. But that has not always been a safe assumption. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, even as States became more interested (and capable) in conducting cyber-operations, they remained silent on the relevant international legal frameworks governing that behaviour.¹⁰³ The effect of such\n¹⁰¹ The same outcome may follow the first option proposed above, denying any legal salience to secret or covert cyber-operations. See supra notes 86-92, and accompanying text. Interestingly, therefore, partial silences are only non-catalysing where their legal content is inferred despite its explicit absence. See supra notes 93-97 and accompanying text.\n¹⁰² Elisabeth Schweiger, Targeted Killing and the Lack of Acquiescence, 32 LEIDEN J.

See Letter dated September 23, 1998 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations concerning Agenda Item 63, U.N. Doc. A/C.1/53/3 (1998). Since then, the Council of Europe concluded a treaty on cyber-crime and discussions are ongoing at the UN for a global cybercrime convention. But aside from these examples (and an African Union treaty that has yet to enter into force), international law offers few cyber-specific conventional regulations.

Did ICT's novelties suggest States should regard cyber-operations, like Internet governance, as largely outside international law's purview, as a case of non liquet, or subject to pre-existing general public international law rules and principles in the absence of overt objections to doing so?¹⁰⁴ As the first edition of the Tallinn Manual summarized it:\nThe threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how. Views on the subject range from a full application of the law of armed conflict, along the lines of the International Court of Justice's pronouncement that it applies to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' to strict application of the Permanent Court of International Justice's pronouncement that acts not forbidden in international law are generally permitted.¹⁰⁵\nIn 2013, a consensus report by a UN Group of Governmental Experts ('UN GGE') affirmed international law's general applicability.¹⁰⁶ Since then, that position has been reiterated by the UN General Assembly and various regional international organizations.¹⁰⁷\nThe resolution of existential questions about international law's application overall, however, merely opened the door to debates over which international laws applied. For example, several states, but principally China, resisted accepting any application of international humanitarian law to online behaviours, arguing that doing so would accelerate the Internet's\nfor Negotiating Cybercrime Treaty amid Concerns over 'Rushed' Vote at Expense of Further Consultations, UN Doc. 12328 (May 26, 2021).\n¹⁰⁴ See Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Sousa Dias, Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond, EJILTALK!

For those who insist that generally applicable international law rules already bind States in cyberspace, it might follow that these statements have no salience. Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita Dias, for example, emphasize that\nInternational legal rules or principles of general applicability, i.e., applicable under general international law to all types of state activity in the relevant circumstances, such as the prohibition on the use of force, non-intervention, the Corfu Channel rule of 'due diligence', international human rights law and international humanitarian law, thus, do not need further proof of applicability to ICTs or other new technologies via specific state practice and opinio juris 'in cyberspace'. Their scope is sufficiently broad to be interpreted and applied to ICTs. It is the burden of those advocating for ICTs' exclusion from their scope to present evidence that states, in their general practice accepted as law, have actively carved out ICTs.¹⁴\nTaking this view one step further, it might be possible to reason that State statements about international law applications are not a constitutive element of customary international law online; and if that is the case, reactive silence to such statements similarly lacks legal salience.\nFor some, however, cyberspace's novelties require States to elaborate new state practice and opinio juris before ascribing legal obligations to States. Consider the views of Israel's Deputy Attorney General:\nIt cannot be automatically presumed that a customary rule applicable in any of the physical domains is also applicable to the cyber domain. The key question in identifying State practice is whether the practice which arose in other domains is closely related to the activity envisaged in the cyber domain. Additionally, it must be ascertained that the opinio juris which gave rise to the customary rules applicable in other domains was not domain-specific. Given the unique characteristics of the cyber domain, such an analysis is to be made with particular prudence, as it is very often the case that relevant differences exist.\nFor supporters of the domain-specific approach, State statements have value as opinio juris, begging the question if they therefore qualify as circumstances calling for a reaction?\n¹³ States have, however, been more vocal in accepting international institutional views on the applicability of international law. See, e.g., Italy, Position Paper on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), ¶3 (concurring with UN GGE and OEWG conclusions on international law's applicability to cyberspace).\n¹⁴ Akande et al., supra note 104.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nWhere State statements have legal salience, their context could signal the audience's acceptance of what the statements say. For some, this conclusion may follow from the technology itself; unlike earlier eras, State views can now be easily expressed, distributed, and aggregated for purposes of assessing *opinio juris*.¹¹⁵ Such capacities may favour considering official State statements as a circumstance calling for a reaction.¹¹⁶ Alternatively, the case for acceptance finds support among ‘specially affected’ States who themselves have the capacity to engage in the same cyber-operations subject to these statements. As Kevin Heller explains, even if silence as consent is controversial, ‘there seems to be widespread acceptance of the idea that specially-affected states, unlike states that are not specially affected, have an obligation to object to a claim concerning the customary status of a practice—and that their silence should be considered support if they do not’.¹¹⁷\nThere are, however, countervailing possibilities. States may remain silent to avoid giving the statement the further credibility a response might imply.¹¹⁸ Or, they may remain silent to avoid the geopolitical fray that aligning with one set of state views or another would entail.¹¹⁹ Some States also clearly have capacity constraints, both in understanding how cyber-operations work and around the relevant international legal issues they raise. Assigning these silences legal salience risks overburdening States by suggesting they must monitor for, and respond to, the views of all the 190+ nation states whenever they choose to\n¹¹⁵ For an example of this in practice, see Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, et al., *Mapping States’ Reactions to the U.S. Strikes Against Syria of April 2018–A Comprehensive Guide*, JUST SECURITY (May 7, 2018).\n¹¹⁶ Evolutions in machine learning are likely to only enhance such capabilities.

Some Member States indicated a reluctance to make similar signals lest they embroil that State in the competition and conflict among these actors; issues States can avoid by staying silent’).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nspeak.¹²⁰ Limiting response obligations to specially affected States (assuming that category can even be identified and the relevant states so designated) could mitigate such concerns, but the secret and covert nature of cyber capacities suggests States may resist conceding capacities for fear it might remove some of their advantages. Big data and machine learning may someday lessen these constraints and equalize state capacities, but those days have yet to arrive.¹²¹ Today, drawing inferences from State silence more likely implicates the agency issues raised above; requiring States to speak out (whether to endorse or oppose other States' statements) involves a political act that would mostly just affirm the power of the States speaking.\nWhatever the legal salience of the ‘reactive’ silence States have offered other States’ statements, it would be a mistake to ignore the silence evident in the more than 150 States who have yet to affirmatively offer their own views on how international law applies in cyberspace. Even if not reactive, such silences appear catalysing. They create space for non-State actors to fill the silence with their own views.¹²² The two *Tallinn Manuals* and the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross serve as the most prominent examples.¹²³ As ‘first movers’, the positions expressed in these efforts have remained influential even among States that decide to break their silence. Thus, even though Germany declined to endorse the second *Tallinn Manual* in its entirety, its own later statement repeatedly and expressly concurs with its views.¹²⁴ Nor is silence’s catalysing effect limited to academic experts.

Stymied over how to articulate international law applications in cyberspace, a 2015 UN GGE identified eleven non-binding ‘voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour’.¹²⁶ These norms purport to establish shared expectations of appropriate future behaviour in cyberspace that do not depend on law to establish their logic of appropriateness.¹²⁷ The precise relationship between these norm promotion efforts and international law is unclear. The 2021 OEWG report clarified these ‘norms do not replace or alter States’ obligations or rights under international law, which are binding, but rather provide additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs’, whilst also noting these ‘[n]orms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law’.¹²⁸ The fact remains, however, that subsequent state endorsements of these norms are often partially silent – they do not address whether and which voluntary norms codify pre-existing international legal rules and standards.¹²⁹\nIV. Conclusion\nAt first glance, the cyber context has little to contribute to a volume on reactive State silence. Except for one passing comment by a Trump Administration official, there is no relevant international legal discourse on ‘circumstances that call for a reaction’ in cyberspace. States have yet to talk about silence’s salience and there are no court opinions (international or domestic) that raise the topic. Thus, we do not know whether, when, or how reactive silence constructs\n¹²⁵ Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v.

As such, we lack requisite evidence to address many of this volume's research questions.¹³⁰ We do not know if the work of non-State actors (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals) or institutional fora (e.g., UN GGE reports) call for a reaction by States, nor whether a legal (viz. a political) claim is necessary to do so. Without recognition of the existence of reactive silences, let alone their thresholds, we have little to say about questions of consistency for purposes of law-production or if the technologies that ICTs represent can impact findings of acquiescence or non-acceptance.\nOn closer examination, however, cyberspace may inform our understanding of State silences in at least three ways. First and foremost, it highlights the importance of distinguishing international legal rhetoric about silence from the fact of its existence. Even if States and other stakeholders have yet to acknowledge it explicitly, our case studies of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law reveal an array of contexts where States have reacted with silence to the claims or conduct of others. Identifying these instances of silence opens the door to the very sorts of interpretations and interactions that have evolved reactive silence in other legal fields. We thus see our chapter as a modest, opening move – an invitation to others to identify and examine incidents of reactive silence in cyberspace and to assess whether they have legal salience, and, if so, whether, when and how they might constitute acceptance, non-acceptance, or opposition.\nSecond, the very inattention reactive silence has received in addressing international law and cyberspace warrants attention. It may, of course, be simply a feature of the field's immaturity that will gradually resolve over time. On the other hand, there may be certain contextual conditions in cyberspace whose existence obstructs any role for reactive silence. Hence, in opening the door to discuss State silences in cyberspace, we also invite consideration of whether and which conditions explain the current silence on State silence.\nConsider, for example, questions of clarity about the existence and meaning of international law itself. Might legal salience for reactive silence require some baseline consensus about what international laws exist or mean in the cyber context before we can assume anything about ensuing silences? Similarly, our discussion of secret and/or covert cyber-operations suggests that reactive silence may depend on some measure of transparency – acknowledged or at least known conduct to which others may react. Does the fact that the underlying behaviour is itself conducted in silence restrict international law's ability to assign value to any reactions, including silence? But even if we could make State behaviours in cyberspace more transparent, questions remain about each State's capacity to\n¹³⁰ See Ch. 1, at xx-xx.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nunderstand the technology, how it works, and what it means for international law generally, let alone reactive silences in particular? At present, cyberspace is rife with capacity questions as the vast majority of States lack sufficient understanding of ICTs as a technical matter, leaving them behind or outside the conduct and conversations of more tech-savvy actors. Assigning silences legal salience in such contexts may not only be difficult but normatively questionable if it enables a form of legal imperialism by those with the most capability to act at the expense of most States who are targeted and/or victimized by other States' behaviour online. The ICT context also suggests that the status quo's susceptibility to change may impact recognition of reactive silences. Given the Internet's dynamic nature, with ICTs constantly evolving (and with them the means and methods by which States operate), it may be difficult to ascribe legal value to responses, silent or otherwise, especially, if at the time, the underlying claims or conduct quickly become outdated or obsolete.\nMore research is needed to assess if clarity, transparency, capability, and/or susceptibility help explain the current silence about State silence in cyberspace. In doing so, we would also invite assessments of whether these conditions may have explanatory value for the state of reactive silence in other areas of international law. Our list is not, however, in any way exhaustive – we would expect that in cyberspace as in other contexts, additional conditions may impact or control reactive silence's contours and contents.\nThird, whatever roles reactive silence occupies in cyberspace, our treatments of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law suggest the utility of additional perspectives on silences. Our treatment has highlighted two – (i) partial silences where silence is broken in reaction to some conduct or claims but silence about international law itself remains; and (ii) catalysing silences where the absence of claims or conduct involving international law trigger or otherwise facilitate non-international legal institutions (e.g., multistakeholder governance models like ICANN) or norms (e.g., the UN GGE's 11 voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour). State silence may also facilitate non-State actor voices within international law (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals).\nAt present, moreover, we believe both partial and catalysing silences have a much larger impact on the construction of international law in cyberspace than reactive silence. As such, we would call for more attention to these silences across international law more generally to see what impacts, if any, they have had on the law's formation, operation, or efficacy.\nState silence may have been a feature of the early Internet, impacting its evolution and, in turn, the availability of international law and international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ninstitutions. Today, in contrast, States are speaking about—and acting in—cyberspace with ever-greater attention and intensity. Rather than diminishing the importance of State silence, however, these voices (and their identities) demand more attention to the legal salience and implications of the silence that remains. Thus, the time is ripe for States to begin to talk about their silence in cyberspace. States and scholars now need to understand when silence can reinforce, rather than undermine, the regulation of the Internet as an open, stable, and secure space for human flourishing and peaceful coexistence among States.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

Although one State—the United States—played a key role in funding the information and communication technologies (ICTs) that evolved into the modern Internet, it was largely developed by university academics and, later, commercial enterprises. There was little input from other States, who were unaware—or uninterested—in the nascent technology and its potential risks and rewards.\nSuch silence stands in contrast to the prevalence of States' verbal and physical acts in and about cyberspace today. Cyberspace's rising priority along humanitarian, economic, political, and military lines has spawned an array of\n A socio-technical institution, cyberspace involves a multi-layered assemblage of hardware, software, and networks that store and exchange data, including chiefly the Internet. Various ways exist to describe these layers. The bottom 'link' layer includes the physical hardware/media used to access the Internet. The next three layers involve coding – 'network' and 'transport' layers break data into packets and route them between networks. An 'applications' layer converts the routed data into useful things like files, videos, and web sites. On top of these coded layers, a final 'content' layer comprises all information shared across ICTs. Each layer functions independently; at the application layer, for example, Google Chrome works regardless of whether the link layer employs DSL or 5G.

Much of this behaviour has implications for the international legal order as States now regularly participate in the governance of cyberspace (i.e., regulating the Internet's technical architecture) and governance in cyberspace (i.e., delineating what behaviours to prohibit, permit, or require). As States speak out more, however, it begs a question: what are the implications of international law for the State silence that remains?\nThe particular conception of State silence that forms the focus of this volume is 'reactive State silence' – the absence of physical or verbal acts of a State against the background of someone else's conduct or claim.5 As this volume's introductory chapter notes, reactive State silence may be legally significant in at least three ways: acceptance, iterating the formation or evolution of international law via concepts like acquiescence;6 lack of acceptance, for example indicating that there is no international agreement;7 or opposition, in the sense of resisting the formation or evolution of international law, for example abstaining from ratifying a treaty or voting in the United Nations General Assembly as evidence of a State's resistance to the formation of a customary rule.8\nThe International Law Commission (ILC)'s work on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice suggests silence may constitute 'acceptance ... when the circumstances call for some reaction'.9 Conclusion 10(3) of the ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification elaborates that '[f]ailure to react over time to a practice may serve as evidence of acceptance as law (opinio juris), provided that States were in a position to react and the circumstances called for some reaction'.10 The accompanying ILC commentary delimits circumstances calling for a reaction 'where the practice is one that affects – usually unfavourably – the interests or rights of the State failing or refusing to act'.11 According to the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nILC being ‘in a position to react’ means that ‘the State concerned must have had knowledge of the practice (which includes circumstances where, because of the publicity given to the practice, it must be assumed that the State had such knowledge)’ and that ‘it must have had sufficient time and ability to act’. As such, the ILC concludes that ‘[w]here a State did not or could not have been expected to know of a certain practice, or has not yet had a reasonable time to respond, inaction cannot be attributed to an acknowledgement that such practice was mandated (or permitted) under customary international law’. The present volume centres on surfacing how States and other actors across different fields of international law understand and apply these abstract and context-independent thresholds.\nIn the cyber domain, however, the concept of reactive silence has been itself met with silence. States, courts, and other actors have had virtually (in both senses of the term) nothing to say about these thresholds specifically, or the potential legal salience of reactive State silence generally. The principal exception to this trend is a 2020 statement by the US Department of Defense General Counsel reflecting on whether sovereignty functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace; he suggested that ‘many States’ public silence in the face of countless publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks precludes a conclusion that States have coalesced around a common view that there is an international prohibition against all such operations ...’. Aside from this (brief) remark, we see little mention of any types of circumstances that call for another State’s reaction in the cyber domain, the meaning of a State’s capacity to react in this context, the threshold of knowledge of another State’s practice, or what amounts to a reasonable passage of time to respond.\nAgainst this background, our chapter offers an inaugural assessment of how reactive silence implicates international law-making in cyberspace. We do so through both descriptive and normative lenses. First, as a descriptive matter, we differentiate the absence of reactive silence rhetoric in international law from its factual existence in various contexts. We introduce three cases – (i) Internet governance, (ii) secret/covert State sponsored cyber-operations; and (iii) unilateral statements by States about international law in cyberspace – where we can identify reactive State silences and offer tentative thoughts on their legal\n Id.

Doing so, in turn, provides a foundation for analysing why States and other stakeholders have yet to recognize reactive silence issues in cyber contexts.\nSecond, extant ambiguity about reactive State silence in cyberspace provides grounds for a normative claim: beyond reactive silences, international law would benefit from acknowledging other manifestations of State silence – which we label catalysing and partial silences – to assess international law and cyberspace. Catalysing silence involves the absence of verbal and/or physical acts of States – whether reactive or not – that empower alternative regulatory forms (e.g., voluntary non-binding norms) or authorities (e.g., non-State actor voices about international law). Partial silence involves instances where there is some verbal/physical State response to a claim or conduct (thereby disqualifying it as a ‘reactive silence’) but that reaction remains silent on all relevant international law implications. Like reactive silence, partial silence raises questions of legal salience in terms of acceptance, non-acceptance, and opposition. Thus, we aim to launch a conversation about the capacities and constraints of reactive silence to construct international law in cyberspace while offering additional frames for assessing State silence’s salience to international law overall.\nOur chapter proceeds in four parts. We begin with State silence’s role in the Internet governance context, where it generally catalysed ‘multistakeholder’ governance, with its reactive forms exhibiting acceptance by certain States of that model and opposition to other States’ attempts to supplant it with more conventional (i.e., multilateral) international legal frameworks. (I) Next, we turn to State silence vis-a-vis the rising number of State-sponsored cyber-operations, whose secret and/or covert nature may explain both their popularity and why States are reluctant to catalog them as State practices that constitute circumstances calling for a reaction under international law. (II) In this context, we explore whether partial silences in response to such operations have their own legal salience in terms of avoiding the international environment’s ‘default permissive condition’. We then turn to a new trend where certain States have begun to offer unilateral statements on how international law applies to cyberspace, asking if a State’s reactive silence to such statements (or the failure to publicize its own views) have legal salience to international-law making and who authors it. (III)\nThese case studies lead us to conclude that, although the cyber context may have little to say about reactive State silence and international law at present, the inattention to this topic itself suggests conditions that may implicate whether and when reactive silences garner legal salience: (i) clarity about the relevant legal\n Alexandra Perina, *Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law*, 53 COLUMB.

TRANSNAT’L L. 507, 576 (2015).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nrules; (ii) transparency about relevant State behaviour; (iii) capability in terms of understanding the underlying claims or conduct; and (iv) susceptibility for circumstances to change rapidly. (IV) Given cyberspace’s status quo, we close with a call for more States to break their silence not only on how international law applies to the cyber domain, but also how to construe any remaining State silences that follow.\n## I. State Silence and Internet Governance\nInternet governance encompasses ‘the design and administration of the technologies necessary to keep the Internet operational and the enactment of substantive policy around these technologies’. It is not ‘a monolithic system’ but ‘a multi-layered system of administration and operational oversight that spans areas as diverse as standards-setting, cybersecurity, and inter-connection arrangements’. At first, most States greeted this topic with silence. Whether out of ignorance or disinterest, most States did not engage with, or even speak about, the Internet’s governing institutions, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which was founded in 1986 and is comprised to this day by technical experts.\nIn contrast to most States, the United States was never completely silent about Internet governance. In 1998, building off its early funding, the U.S. Department of Commerce solicited proposals for an institution to regulate the Internet’s naming and numbering system. The winning candidate was a non-profit entity based in Los Angeles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), that proposed to operate the system via ‘multi-stakeholder governance’ where individuals, non-commercial stakeholder groups, industry, and governments would offer inputs on a community-based, consensus\n LAURA DENARDIS, THE GLOBAL WAR FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE (Yale University Press 2014), at 6.\n Id., at 226.\n The IETF is responsible for designating technical standards and protocols by which the Internet operates. IETF, Missions and Principles, at https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/.\n Common, shared standards and protocols are necessary for connections to occur among today’s billions of digital devices and thousands of networks. For example, the servers used to send and receive things like e-mail each have an Internet protocol (IP) address while each e-mail address has a ‘domain’ name including top-level domains like .com or .edu and then second-level domains; hence, each university has a second-level domain under the top-level .edu domain (e.g., temple.edu). For this system to work, there must be a coordinated effort to distribute and track IP addresses, assign domain names, and oversee protocol parameter identifiers that are used by Internet standards.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ndriven approach. ICANN’s emergence is significant for reflecting on State silence in the cyber domain because, as Milton Mueller explains, ‘ICANN’s original institutional design marked a revolutionary departure from traditional approaches to global governance’ providing ‘one of the few globally centralized points of control over the Internet’. Its mode of governance may be understood as a form of privatization which ‘significantly reduced the power of national governments and existing intergovernmental organizations over communication and information policy’. According to the The Economist, for example, ICANN amounted to a ‘completely new institutional animal [...] a hybrid between an online community and a real-world governance structure, an untested combination [...]: an industry trying to regulate part of itself, across the globe, with little or no input from national governments’. At the same time, as Goldsmith and Wu explain, ICANN remained legally under contract to the US Department of Commerce, which had delegated the day-to-day management of Internet naming and numbering decisions to the organisation. Thus, ‘ICANN’s spirit of ‘self-regulation’ was an appealing label for a process that could be more accurately described as the U.S. government brokering a behind-the-scenes deal that best suited its policy preferences [...] to ensure the stability of the Internet, to fend off the regulatory efforts of foreign governments and international organisations, and to maintain ultimate control’.\nICANN’s establishment can best be characterized as producing reactive silence among States. To be clear, States were not completely silent; in word and deed, they accepted – some more reluctantly than others – ICANN’s authority to govern the Internet’s naming and numbering function pursuant to U.S. domestic law (in addition to its Department of Commerce contract, ICANN was\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nincorporated under California law). Yet, when it came to rhetoric about international law or engagement with international legal institutions, many States remained silent. Although neither States nor commentators have reflected on the precise meaning of this reactive silence, in practice it inescapably amounted to State toleration of an approach to Internet governance that did not directly involve international law.\nStates' initial toleration of ICANN was periodically subject to disruption as 'sovereigns outside the United States perceived it as a threat to their authority'.[27] Three such efforts – and the reactive silence they generated – warrant attention here. An initial disruption period occurred during the UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) – a multilateral series of diplomatic conferences between 2002 and 2005 that sought to address a diversity of issues related to the information society, but which ultimately morphed into a 'battle over the soul of the Internet'.[28] According to Mueller, WSIS witnessed 'a collision between those who saw national governments as the proper agents for defining and implementing international communication and information policy, and those who pursued a more open, pluralistic, and transnational policy-making framework'.[29] For example, China, with the support of a number of Global South countries, proposed to establish an international Internet organisation and adoption of an Internet treaty.[30] Then, before WSIS's second phase in 2005, the United States back-tracked on promises it had made in 1998 to relinquish authority over ICANN (and the 'root' server that executed its naming and numbering functions) in 2006.[31] The European Union responded by proposing that the governance over the domain name system be shifted from ICANN to a UN-affiliated intergovernmental group.[32] Neither the Chinese nor EU proposals succeeded, but they resulted in a compromise where the US and ICANN retained authority over domain names and numbers, but a new Internet Governance Forum was established where States could offer and discuss recommendations concerning Internet policy.[33]\nThe past decade witnessed a second disruptive period as other States and stakeholders revived complaints about U.S. final authority over ICANN and its\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nmultistakeholder approach to Internet governance. The differences had deep conceptual underpinnings over whether cyberspace is a 'space' warranting autonomous regulation or a 'technology' that can be regulated by sovereign nations or the international organizations they create. Supporting the latter frame, States like China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) sought to legitimize a broad statist approach to Internet governance with both technical and content governance dimensions. In terms of technical regulation, these States called for a multilateral organization – the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) – to displace the multistakeholder model of governance embodied by ICANN. In terms of content regulation, under the banner of 'information security' these States sought to legitimize their efforts to monitor and suppress online forms of expression they viewed as a security threat, including expressions of internal dissent and anti-government content. For example, in 2009 the SCO adopted an agreement that defined 'information war' in broad terms as 'dissemination of information harmful to political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other States'.\nBoth the technical and content regulation dimensions of the statist vision for Internet governance were embodied in a draft 'Code of Conduct' that China, Russia and other members of the SCO submitted to the UN General Assembly in 2011 and again in revised form in early 2015. As Eliza Watt notes, the Draft\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\n\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nCodes marked ‘a first step towards the development of a universal document under the auspices of the UN aimed at providing comprehensive information security’. The 2011 Draft Code endorsed ‘the establishment of a multilateral, transparent and democratic international management of the Internet to ensure an equitable distribution of resources, facilitate access for all and ensure a stable and secure functioning of the Internet’. On content regulation, the same text promoted ‘curbing the dissemination of information that incites terrorism, secessionism or extremism or that undermines other countries’ political, economic and social stability, as well as their spiritual and cultural environment’.\nUnsurprisingly, the United States strongly resisted the 2011 Draft Code for fear these proposals would ‘make it easier for governments to suppress free speech’ and ‘legitimize repressive state practices’. Although the 2015 Draft Code purported to reflect revisions ‘taking into full consideration the comments and suggestions from all parties’, its vision and approach remained largely the same. Neither version of the Draft Codes managed to garner sufficient support amongst other States in the international community.\nRussian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, U.N.Doc.

At the WCIT, Russia sought to ensure ITU control over the Internet’s name and numbering system by proposing ITR revisions which provided that ‘Member States shall have equal rights to manage the Internet, including in regard to the allotment, assignment and reclamation of Internet numbering, naming, addressing and identification resources and to support for the operation and development of basic Internet infrastructure’. The United States and European Union Member States resisted and ensured the provision’s removal, alongside a disclaimer in ITR Article 1.1(a) that confirmed the ITRs ‘do not address the content-related aspects of telecommunications’.\nRussia nonetheless managed to secure the inclusion of a separate resolution attached to the treaty text, recognising that ‘all governments should have an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance and for ensuring the stability, security and continuity of the existing Internet and its future development and of the future internet’. This led dozens of States to remain silent on the ITRs by declining to sign and/or ratify them, even as ultimately, a majority of 89 out of 144 ITU Member States adopted the new regulations. The United States explicitly tied its inaction to, inter alia, the ‘provisions on internet governance’. The head of the US delegation, Terry Kramer, expressed concern that the revised text might be used by authoritarian\n See Eichensehr, supra note 35, at 329-335.\n Proposals Received from ITU Member States for the Work of the Conference, Document DT/1-E, World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT-12), Dubai, Dec. 2-14, 2012 (Nov. 20, 2012), Art. 3A, Add.

Through a multi-year process ending in 2016, the United States relinquished its contractual control over ICANN. In its place, ICANN’s stakeholders adopted a revamped, global, multi-stakeholder model of governance (albeit one still incorporated under California law).56\nThe Internet governance context offers four lessons for how we think about State silence generally and reactive State silence in particular. For starters, it contextualizes why there has been so little discussion of reactive State silence and international law in the cyber domain, namely, the absence of international legal mechanisms for governance generally. The emergence of the ICANN multistakeholder regulatory model led to situations where the effects of reactive State silence to both its establishment and attempts to supplant it were so self-evident as to not merit comment. Here, State silence in reaction to ICANN’s emergence inevitably amounted to acceptance (albeit not of the formation or evolution of international law per se), tolerating regulation outside national and multilateral legal structures. At the same time, State silence in reaction to the Draft Codes and the revised ITRs inescapably constituted lack of acceptance or opposition to attempts to supplant the extant multistakeholder model with specific forms of international legal governance.\nSecond, the Internet governance context suggests a need to broaden the backdrop against which international lawyers evaluate State silence. Most existing scholarship has considered ‘reactive’ silence in endogenous terms, examining how State silence impacts obligations or institutions in existing and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nacknowledged international legal regimes. The story of Internet governance highlights an exogenous ‘catalysing’ form of State silence. Instead of impacting international law’s contents, here State silence catalyses the contraction of its contours, fostering or supporting other regulatory models, whether the original U.S. national legal authorities or the current multistakeholder framework.\nMoreover, State silences in response to the Draft Codes also arguably had a catalysing effect. In particular, State silences on Internet governance frameworks both reflected—and to some extent created—space for other regulatory models to take hold, including: (i) private forms of governance (for example, content moderation rules and practices developed by social media companies like Facebook), (ii) non-binding voluntary norms (for example, the Christchurch Call), (iii) regional human rights law (for example, those focused on the permissibility of different models of intermediary liability frameworks), (iv) negotiations for regional regulations (for example, the European Union’s Digital Services Act package and General Data Protection Regulation), and (v) domestic law (for example, intermediary liability laws and constitutional law). The result is today’s regime complex of online content governance that reflects a plurality of regulatory approaches.\nThird, we should be careful to acknowledge that the plurality of regulatory approaches to Internet governance has involved the selective, rather than absolute, absence of international law. For example, while opposing ITU involvement in Internet governance, the United States supported application of World Intellectual Property Organization treaties to the Internet and the adoption of World Trade Organization decisions implicating the cyber domain.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIndeed, through these international legal regimes the United States – together with US technology giants such as Google and Facebook – consolidated a neoliberal model of Internet governance, one with greater emphasis on intellectual property protection, the ‘free flow of information doctrine’, and the collection and monetization of personal data for profit, rather than, for example, data protection and privacy. Similarly, the demise of the Draft Codes did not mean a law-free zone for Internet governance given extant international law regimes empowering State efforts to regulate speech domestically (e.g., prescriptive jurisdiction) or to cabin when and how they may do so (e.g., international human rights provisions on freedom of expression).\nFinally, divisions amongst States highlight the importance of the political context to the interplay among speech acts and silence. In Internet governance, reactive State silence played a stabilizing role that reinforced particular power dynamics. The United States, its allies, and its ‘Big Tech’ companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) flourished under the extant multistakeholder model and preferred its evolution over any ITU substitution. In contrast, States that spoke out were the disrupters, seeking to supplant the ICANN model in favour of a statist vision of Internet governance. In this dynamic, the act of refusing to break silence (e.g., by ratifying a new treaty or endorsing an ITU role) was not only an act of power, but signalled a priority to one collective grouping of States and stakeholders over another.\n## II. State Silence and State-Sponsored Cyber-operations\nAs States gained interest in the architecture by which the Internet operates, they also become interested in how they might employ it for political, military, and intelligence purposes. ICTs offered States a way to operate quickly and (relatively) cheaply on a global scale. They could do so, moreover, both secretly and covertly – the technology affords anonymity to most actors who want it with technical attribution of responsibility to a particular computer system difficult, to say nothing of ascribing responsibility to a human operator or those who direct them. States have taken advantage of these features to conduct various offensive ‘cyber-operations’, including: (i) cyber-attacks that disrupt or disable the availability or integrity of computer systems, networks, or the infrastructure they\n Zalnieriute, supra note 63, at 63-65; see also Henning Lahmann, On the Politics and Ideologies of the Sovereignty Discourse in Cyberspace, 32 DUKE J.

Many of these operations involve 'proxies', further complicating efforts to delimit online activity under the direction or control of a State.\nThe secret and covert nature of State and State-sponsored cyber-operations complicates any assessment of associated silences. Importantly, neither secrecy nor covertness are uniform concepts. It is important, for example, to differentiate deep and shallow secret cyber-operations. Deep secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence is not yet publicly known. Shallow secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence becomes publicly known – for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or other actors' detection – but whose content remains obscured. In addition, a distinction may be drawn between non-covert, covert, and quasi-covert cyber-operations. Non-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State officially acknowledged by the acting State. Covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are officially unacknowledged by the acting State. Quasi-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are either acknowledged in part, acknowledged at some point after taking place, or reported and hypothetically justified without official acknowledgements by the acting State.\nCyber-operations are, by design, almost always meant to occur unobserved, and, if observed, be unattributable to, or at least unacknowledged\n See, e.g., Herbert Lin &amp; Jackie Kerr, On Cyber-Enabled Information/Influence Warfare and Manipulation, in P. CORNISH (Ed.), THE OXFORD HANDBOOK ON CYBERSECURITY (OUP 2022); Herbert S. Lin, Offensive Cyber-operations and the Use of Force, 4 J. NAT'L SECURITY L. &amp; POL'Y 63 (2010). In addition, States engage in a range of 'defensive' behaviours on-line some of which, like the US 'defend forward' policy may be perceived by their targets as offensive in character.

Deep secret cyber-operations thus raise a cyber version of the proverbial question of whether a tree that falls in the forest makes a sound when there is no one there to hear it? If a cyber-operation never comes to light, we might characterize the silence that accompanies it as non-reactive – to use the language of the ILC, it is difficult to see how a State could be characterised as being ‘in a position to react’ to a cyber-operation where the State lacks ‘knowledge’ of it.71 Still, there are intermediate postures between entirely unknown cyber behaviours and public and acknowledged acts where a potential for reactions (and thus, reactive silences) arise. A State may be able to observe (or believe it knows of) another State’s covert cyber-operation and decline to respond.\nAt the same time, surveying State silences in response to hostile cyber-operations that have become publicly known to date, we see value in expanding the scope of State reactions beyond such cases of complete silence (where a State offers no responsive speech, behaviour, or engagement). Secret and covert cyber-operations have highlighted the potential for what we call partial silence—explicit State speech, behaviour, or engagements in response to a cyber-operation, which is silent either with respect to international law in general or as to the specific norms of international law implicated.72\nAn example of complete silence is Iran’s initial response to the Stuxnet cyber-operation. When its centrifuges began spinning out of control in 2008, Iran had no reaction, apparently on the assumption that the failure stemmed from internal operating problems rather than external causes.73 It took years for Iran to break its complete silence by characterising the incident as a ‘massive cyber-attack’ and accusing the US and Israel of deploying the malicious computer worm, albeit without any suggestion that it was an internationally wrongful act.74\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn recent years, such a partial silence in response to hostile cyber-operations has become increasingly common.75 Sometimes, States have responded by publicly attributing cyber-operations to other States without condemnation. For example, the only US public response to the 2014-2015 massive data theft from the Office of Personnel Management was admiration – James Clapper, then-head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, remarked that ‘you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did’.76\nOther times, States have condemned the behaviour of other States whilst remaining silent as to the incident’s characterisation under international law. US Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, suggested that the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated North Korea’s ‘flagrant disregard for international norms’,77 while US President Obama similarly avoided international law language in characterising Russia’s cyber information operation on the 2016 US presidential election as a ‘violation of established norms of behaviour’.78 These partial silences persist even where condemnations take a coordinated form. For instance, in response to the 2017 spread of WannaCry malware (which disrupted the functioning of hundreds of thousands of computers across over 150 States), the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing the cyber-attack to North Korea and condemning its behaviour without mentioning international law at all.79\nthat Iran had detected a planned “massive cyber-attack” against its nuclear facilities, blaming the United States, Israel and Britain’).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn one exceptional case, States did publicly combine an attribution of hostile cyber-operations to another State with claims they were violative of international law (whilst remaining silent as to which specific rules of international law were violated). In October 2018, the UK and its allies exposed and condemned a series of cyber-operations conducted by the Russian military intelligence service against political institutions, businesses, media outlets, and an international sports agency. The UK Foreign Secretary suggested that ‘this pattern of behaviour demonstrates [Russia’s] desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences’. The Netherlands suggested these activities ‘undermine the international rule of law’, while Canada’s statement made clear that Russia’s malicious cyber activities ‘demonstrate a disregard for international law and undermine the rules-based international order’. None of these accusations delineated whether all of the GRU’s alleged operations violated international law or if only some did; nor did they elaborate which international laws were violated.\nIn short, both victim and third States are almost always completely or partially silent in response to hostile cyber-operations. As Efrony and Shany note, there is currently ‘so little in the practice of victim States to indicate that [their international legal rights] actually guide their conduct when confronted by cyber-operations’. For our purposes, it is just as important to note the pervasive\nLongergan, What Makes This Attribution of Chinese Hacking Different, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT (July 22, 2021).\nSee UK National Cyber Security Centre, Reckless campaign of cyber-attacks by Russian military intelligence service exposed, PRESS RELEASE (Oct. 4, 2018) ('flagrant violation of international law'); see also Council of the EU, Joint statement by Presidents Tusk and Juncker and High Representative Mogherini on Russian cyber-attacks, PRESS RELEASE (Oct. 4, 2018) ('We deplore such actions, which undermine international law and international institutions'); Prime Minister of Australia, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, Media Release: Attribution of a Pattern of Malicious Cyber Activity to Russia (Oct. 4, 2018) ('contrary to the consensus on international law and norms'); see also Jeffrey Biller and Michael Schmitt, Un-caging the Bear?

Why have States been so reticent to invoke the vocabulary of international law or assess any legal salience in their silences?\nOne possibility may be that victim States assume the secret and/or covert nature of hostile cyber-operations negates their characterisation as a practice that calls for a reaction. While the development of international law generally occurs through the practice of a few ‘movers and shakers’ in combination with the reactive silence of a larger number of passive States, not all reactive State silences are legally salient. Here, it may be significant that there has generally been silence accompanying the hostile cyber-operations themselves, whether in their secrecy (which ‘may obscure the practice itself, or any related, internally held opinio juris’) or their covertness, (where even if the acts become a shallow secret—publicly known, for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or detection by other actors—acting States uniformly decline to acknowledge their authorship).\nIt is commonly asserted that State acts must be public to qualify as state practice. According to the International Law Association’s (ILA) Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, for example, ‘a secret physical act [...] is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tried to assert that its conduct was legally justified’. This suggests that a State conducting cyber-operations that remain deep secrets or, if discovered, remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by the State alleged to have conducted it), will ‘cede its voice and weight of its practice in the development of the law’.

And if there’s no legally relevant practice, there is nothing to which the victim State must respond (whether via acquiescence or in opposition). Under this approach, reactive silences would only have legal effects if the accused State itself attempted to acknowledge its behaviour (a move that has yet to occur in cyberspace as States rarely, if ever, explicitly acknowledge specific cyber-operations as their own).\nWhatever the strength of such logic, the fact that States have yet to express it leaves open the possibility that other actors may assign legal salience to their reactive silences, even those that are partial in nature. The ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification, for example, suggest that for practice to contribute to the formation and identification of customary international law, it is sufficient for it to ‘be known to other States (whether or not it is publicly available)’, adding that ‘it is difficult to see how confidential conduct by a State could serve such a purpose unless and until it is known to other States’. Similarly, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law claims that ‘in order to count, practice has to be public or communicated to some extent’, a requirement that can be fulfilled once the practice is ‘communicated to one other State or relevant international organization including the ICRC’, even communications made to the ICRC in confidence. On this view, for secret and/or covert cyber-operations to constitute conditions calling for a reaction it may suffice for them to ‘be known to other States’, even if they remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by States alleged to have conducted them).\nFrom this perspective, there follows the possibility of investing legal salience in a State’s reactive silence to at least some types of secret or covert cyber-operations. For instance, a complete reactive silence to a shallow secret operation could be deemed acceptance based on the ILC’s endorsement of the idea that practices may be deemed evidence of opinio juris where it represents\n BUCHAN, supra note 91, at 154, 164.

Whether or not States currently condemn hostile cyber accusations in explicitly legal terms, can signalling disapproval of such acts (as US President Biden did recently with respect to Chinese cyber-espionage) counter-act claims the accused State’s operations are (or are becoming) permitted by international law—in other words, counter-act any notion that such practices are being tolerated?\nAlternatively, individual reactive partial silences might accumulate in scale over time to generate what is deemed to be a de facto collective acceptance of the practice of various cyber-operations. In other words, if States’ usage over time continuously denounces cyber-operations as unwanted but not internationally unlawful, might States at some point infer international law does not prohibit such acts—or at the least, transform a ‘real rule’ of international law into a ‘paper rule’. Under this reasoning, partial silences would be read literally, suggesting the underlying behaviour is, as the colloquial saying goes, ‘awful but lawful’. According to Perina, for example, ‘[s]hallowly secret covert activity that is tolerated by the international community encourages in both the covert actors and third States the practice of covert behavior, as it confirms that the political costs of covertness are low’.\nSuch a view aligns with those who view espionage as either a lawful exception to otherwise unlawful acts or outside international law’s purview entirely (especially where victim States consistently object to espionage on political grounds or claim violations of national laws without international legal objections). The US Department of Defense General Counsel’s 2020 statement suggests such reasoning, rejecting the idea that sovereignty always functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace given so many States’ complete or partially silent reactions to countless cases of publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks. This view might, of course, be characterized as giving international law a permissive content as to State sponsored cyber-operations.\n See supra note 10 and accompanying text.\n See White House Press Release, supra note 79.\n Perina, supra note 15, at 576 (citing Michael J Glennon, How International Rules Die, 93 GEORGETOWN L. J. 939, 953, 956 (2005).\n Perina, supra note 15, at 579; see also ARONSSON-STORRIER, supra note 69, at 137-141 (critiquing the notion that publicly known, but unacknowledged, acts to which states remain silent should be considered legally salient).\n See Ney, supra note 14 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nBut like espionage, it may also represent a catalysing silence, shifting the conduct beyond international law’s purview.\nAbsent rhetoric (let alone doctrine) on reactive silences in cyberspace, it is difficult to know what legal meaning – none, opposition, acceptance – to assign to complete or partially silent reactions to State cyber-operations. Such ambiguity counsels States to clarify how their silences should be understood in different circumstances to mitigate the possibility of other actors misconstruing and assigning meaning to them. In doing so, however, we must recognize the challenge of agency. Assigning any legal salience to silence, whether as acceptance or not, risks marginalizing those States prone to silence, not because of any legal position, but because they may lack the time, knowledge, or capabilities to determine how best to legally characterise hostile cyber-operations, to say nothing of State interests in avoiding engagements that may trigger involvements with opposing hegemonic actors.\n## III. State Silences and State Statements on the Application of International Law to Cyber-operations\nSo far, we have assumed at least some international legal regulation of State-sponsored cyber-operations. But that has not always been a safe assumption. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, even as States became more interested (and capable) in conducting cyber-operations, they remained silent on the relevant international legal frameworks governing that behaviour. The effect of such\n The same outcome may follow the first option proposed above, denying any legal salience to secret or covert cyber-operations. See supra notes 86-92, and accompanying text. Interestingly, therefore, partial silences are only non-catalysing where their legal content is inferred despite its explicit absence. See supra notes 93-97 and accompanying text.\n Elisabeth Schweiger, Targeted Killing and the Lack of Acquiescence, 32 LEIDEN J.

In 2018, however, Russia proposed States negotiate a treaty to regulate information weapons; the idea received a cool reception from Western states worried that doing so would green-light constraints on privacy and freedom of expression. See Letter dated September 23, 1998 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations concerning Agenda Item 63, U.N. Doc. A/C.1/53/3 (1998). Since then, the Council of Europe concluded a treaty on cyber-crime and discussions are ongoing at the UN for a global cybercrime convention. But aside from these examples (and an African Union treaty that has yet to enter into force), international law offers few cyber-specific conventional regulations. See, e.g., Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, Nov. 23, 2001) CETS No 185; UNGA Press Release, General Assembly Adopts Resolution Outlining Terms\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nsilence was, however, far from clear. Did ICT's novelties suggest States should regard cyber-operations, like Internet governance, as largely outside international law's purview, as a case of non liquet, or subject to pre-existing general public international law rules and principles in the absence of overt objections to doing so? As the first edition of the Tallinn Manual summarized it:\nThe threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how. Views on the subject range from a full application of the law of armed conflict, along the lines of the International Court of Justice's pronouncement that it applies to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' to strict application of the Permanent Court of International Justice's pronouncement that acts not forbidden in international law are generally permitted.\nIn 2013, a consensus report by a UN Group of Governmental Experts ('UN GGE') affirmed international law's general applicability. Since then, that position has been reiterated by the UN General Assembly and various regional international organizations.\nThe resolution of existential questions about international law's application overall, however, merely opened the door to debates over which international laws applied. For example, several states, but principally China, resisted accepting any application of international humanitarian law to online behaviours, arguing that doing so would accelerate the Internet's\nfor Negotiating Cybercrime Treaty amid Concerns over 'Rushed' Vote at Expense of Further Consultations, UN Doc. 12328 (May 26, 2021).\n See Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Sousa Dias, Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond, EJILTALK!

Other existing international law doctrines and mechanisms (e.g., due diligence, countermeasures) encountered similar challenges.\nIn 2012, the United States began to elaborate its official views on how international law applies to cyberspace via a series of public statements. In 2018, the United Kingdom did the same. Other (mostly Western) States followed these examples by issuing unilateral statements of their own. Over 25 States have now offered national views on international law’s application to cyberspace and a UN Open Ended Working Group ('OEWG') has called for all States to do so.\nFor all the attention such statements garnered, much less has been devoted to the reactive silence they received.

How should international law assess these silences? For those who insist that generally applicable international law rules already bind States in cyberspace, it might follow that these statements have no salience. Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita Dias, for example, emphasize that\nInternational legal rules or principles of general applicability, i.e., applicable under general international law to all types of state activity in the relevant circumstances, such as the prohibition on the use of force, non-intervention, the Corfu Channel rule of 'due diligence', international human rights law and international humanitarian law, thus, do not need further proof of applicability to ICTs or other new technologies via specific state practice and opinio juris 'in cyberspace'. Their scope is sufficiently broad to be interpreted and applied to ICTs. It is the burden of those advocating for ICTs' exclusion from their scope to present evidence that states, in their general practice accepted as law, have actively carved out ICTs.\nTaking this view one step further, it might be possible to reason that State statements about international law applications are not a constitutive element of customary international law online; and if that is the case, reactive silence to such statements similarly lacks legal salience.\nFor some, however, cyberspace's novelties require States to elaborate new state practice and opinio juris before ascribing legal obligations to States. Consider the views of Israel's Deputy Attorney General:\nIt cannot be automatically presumed that a customary rule applicable in any of the physical domains is also applicable to the cyber domain. The key question in identifying State practice is whether the practice which arose in other domains is closely related to the activity envisaged in the cyber domain. Additionally, it must be ascertained that the opinio juris which gave rise to the customary rules applicable in other domains was not domain-specific. Given the unique characteristics of the cyber domain, such an analysis is to be made with particular prudence, as it is very often the case that relevant differences exist.\nFor supporters of the domain-specific approach, State statements have value as opinio juris, begging the question if they therefore qualify as circumstances calling for a reaction?\n States have, however, been more vocal in accepting international institutional views on the applicability of international law. See, e.g., Italy, Position Paper on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), ¶3 (concurring with UN GGE and OEWG conclusions on international law's applicability to cyberspace).\n Akande et al., supra note 104.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nWhere State statements have legal salience, their context could signal the audience's acceptance of what the statements say. For some, this conclusion may follow from the technology itself; unlike earlier eras, State views can now be easily expressed, distributed, and aggregated for purposes of assessing *opinio juris*. Such capacities may favour considering official State statements as a circumstance calling for a reaction. Alternatively, the case for acceptance finds support among ‘specially affected’ States who themselves have the capacity to engage in the same cyber-operations subject to these statements. As Kevin Heller explains, even if silence as consent is controversial, ‘there seems to be widespread acceptance of the idea that specially-affected states, unlike states that are not specially affected, have an obligation to object to a claim concerning the customary status of a practice—and that their silence should be considered support if they do not’.\nThere are, however, countervailing possibilities. States may remain silent to avoid giving the statement the further credibility a response might imply. Or, they may remain silent to avoid the geopolitical fray that aligning with one set of state views or another would entail. Some States also clearly have capacity constraints, both in understanding how cyber-operations work and around the relevant international legal issues they raise. Assigning these silences legal salience risks overburdening States by suggesting they must monitor for, and respond to, the views of all the 190+ nation states whenever they choose to\n For an example of this in practice, see Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, et al., *Mapping States’ Reactions to the U.S. Strikes Against Syria of April 2018–A Comprehensive Guide*, JUST SECURITY (May 7, 2018).\n Evolutions in machine learning are likely to only enhance such capabilities.

Some Member States indicated a reluctance to make similar signals lest they embroil that State in the competition and conflict among these actors; issues States can avoid by staying silent’).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nspeak. Limiting response obligations to specially affected States (assuming that category can even be identified and the relevant states so designated) could mitigate such concerns, but the secret and covert nature of cyber capacities suggests States may resist conceding capacities for fear it might remove some of their advantages. Big data and machine learning may someday lessen these constraints and equalize state capacities, but those days have yet to arrive. Today, drawing inferences from State silence more likely implicates the agency issues raised above; requiring States to speak out (whether to endorse or oppose other States' statements) involves a political act that would mostly just affirm the power of the States speaking.\nWhatever the legal salience of the ‘reactive’ silence States have offered other States’ statements, it would be a mistake to ignore the silence evident in the more than 150 States who have yet to affirmatively offer their own views on how international law applies in cyberspace. Even if not reactive, such silences appear catalysing. They create space for non-State actors to fill the silence with their own views. The two *Tallinn Manuals* and the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross serve as the most prominent examples. As ‘first movers’, the positions expressed in these efforts have remained influential even among States that decide to break their silence. Thus, even though Germany declined to endorse the second *Tallinn Manual* in its entirety, its own later statement repeatedly and expressly concurs with its views. Nor is silence’s catalysing effect limited to academic experts. In the landmark surveillance case, *Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v. the UK*, the European Court of Human Rights was able to assess the compliance of the UK’s extraterritorial surveillance regime with the European Convention on Human Rights on ‘the assumption’ that the matters\n On challenges of human and financial resources of Third World states with respect to customary international law, see B.S.

Stymied over how to articulate international law applications in cyberspace, a 2015 UN GGE identified eleven non-binding ‘voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour’. These norms purport to establish shared expectations of appropriate future behaviour in cyberspace that do not depend on law to establish their logic of appropriateness. The precise relationship between these norm promotion efforts and international law is unclear. The 2021 OEWG report clarified these ‘norms do not replace or alter States’ obligations or rights under international law, which are binding, but rather provide additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs’, whilst also noting these ‘[n]orms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law’. The fact remains, however, that subsequent state endorsements of these norms are often partially silent – they do not address whether and which voluntary norms codify pre-existing international legal rules and standards.\nIV. Conclusion\nAt first glance, the cyber context has little to contribute to a volume on reactive State silence. Except for one passing comment by a Trump Administration official, there is no relevant international legal discourse on ‘circumstances that call for a reaction’ in cyberspace. States have yet to talk about silence’s salience and there are no court opinions (international or domestic) that raise the topic. Thus, we do not know whether, when, or how reactive silence constructs\n Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v.

As such, we lack requisite evidence to address many of this volume's research questions. We do not know if the work of non-State actors (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals) or institutional fora (e.g., UN GGE reports) call for a reaction by States, nor whether a legal (viz. a political) claim is necessary to do so. Without recognition of the existence of reactive silences, let alone their thresholds, we have little to say about questions of consistency for purposes of law-production or if the technologies that ICTs represent can impact findings of acquiescence or non-acceptance.\nOn closer examination, however, cyberspace may inform our understanding of State silences in at least three ways. First and foremost, it highlights the importance of distinguishing international legal rhetoric about silence from the fact of its existence. Even if States and other stakeholders have yet to acknowledge it explicitly, our case studies of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law reveal an array of contexts where States have reacted with silence to the claims or conduct of others. Identifying these instances of silence opens the door to the very sorts of interpretations and interactions that have evolved reactive silence in other legal fields. We thus see our chapter as a modest, opening move – an invitation to others to identify and examine incidents of reactive silence in cyberspace and to assess whether they have legal salience, and, if so, whether, when and how they might constitute acceptance, non-acceptance, or opposition.\nSecond, the very inattention reactive silence has received in addressing international law and cyberspace warrants attention. It may, of course, be simply a feature of the field's immaturity that will gradually resolve over time. On the other hand, there may be certain contextual conditions in cyberspace whose existence obstructs any role for reactive silence. Hence, in opening the door to discuss State silences in cyberspace, we also invite consideration of whether and which conditions explain the current silence on State silence.\nConsider, for example, questions of clarity about the existence and meaning of international law itself. Might legal salience for reactive silence require some baseline consensus about what international laws exist or mean in the cyber context before we can assume anything about ensuing silences? Similarly, our discussion of secret and/or covert cyber-operations suggests that reactive silence may depend on some measure of transparency – acknowledged or at least known conduct to which others may react. Does the fact that the underlying behaviour is itself conducted in silence restrict international law's ability to assign value to any reactions, including silence? But even if we could make State behaviours in cyberspace more transparent, questions remain about each State's capacity to\n See Ch. 1, at xx-xx.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nunderstand the technology, how it works, and what it means for international law generally, let alone reactive silences in particular? At present, cyberspace is rife with capacity questions as the vast majority of States lack sufficient understanding of ICTs as a technical matter, leaving them behind or outside the conduct and conversations of more tech-savvy actors. Assigning silences legal salience in such contexts may not only be difficult but normatively questionable if it enables a form of legal imperialism by those with the most capability to act at the expense of most States who are targeted and/or victimized by other States' behaviour online. The ICT context also suggests that the status quo's susceptibility to change may impact recognition of reactive silences. Given the Internet's dynamic nature, with ICTs constantly evolving (and with them the means and methods by which States operate), it may be difficult to ascribe legal value to responses, silent or otherwise, especially, if at the time, the underlying claims or conduct quickly become outdated or obsolete.\nMore research is needed to assess if clarity, transparency, capability, and/or susceptibility help explain the current silence about State silence in cyberspace. In doing so, we would also invite assessments of whether these conditions may have explanatory value for the state of reactive silence in other areas of international law. Our list is not, however, in any way exhaustive – we would expect that in cyberspace as in other contexts, additional conditions may impact or control reactive silence's contours and contents.\nThird, whatever roles reactive silence occupies in cyberspace, our treatments of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law suggest the utility of additional perspectives on silences. Our treatment has highlighted two – (i) partial silences where silence is broken in reaction to some conduct or claims but silence about international law itself remains; and (ii) catalysing silences where the absence of claims or conduct involving international law trigger or otherwise facilitate non-international legal institutions (e.g., multistakeholder governance models like ICANN) or norms (e.g., the UN GGE's 11 voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour). State silence may also facilitate non-State actor voices within international law (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals).\nAt present, moreover, we believe both partial and catalysing silences have a much larger impact on the construction of international law in cyberspace than reactive silence. As such, we would call for more attention to these silences across international law more generally to see what impacts, if any, they have had on the law's formation, operation, or efficacy.\nState silence may have been a feature of the early Internet, impacting its evolution and, in turn, the availability of international law and international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ninstitutions. Today, in contrast, States are speaking about—and acting in—cyberspace with ever-greater attention and intensity. Rather than diminishing the importance of State silence, however, these voices (and their identities) demand more attention to the legal salience and implications of the silence that remains. Thus, the time is ripe for States to begin to talk about their silence in cyberspace. States and scholars now need to understand when silence can reinforce, rather than undermine, the regulation of the Internet as an open, stable, and secure space for human flourishing and peaceful coexistence among States.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

Although one State—the United States—played a key role in funding the information and communication technologies (ICTs) that evolved into the modern Internet, it was largely developed by university academics and, later, commercial enterprises. There was little input from other States, who were unaware—or uninterested—in the nascent technology and its potential risks and rewards.\nSuch silence stands in contrast to the prevalence of States' verbal and physical acts in and about cyberspace today. Cyberspace's rising priority along humanitarian, economic, political, and military lines has spawned an array of\n A socio-technical institution, cyberspace involves a multi-layered assemblage of hardware, software, and networks that store and exchange data, including chiefly the Internet. Various ways exist to describe these layers. The bottom 'link' layer includes the physical hardware/media used to access the Internet. The next three layers involve coding – 'network' and 'transport' layers break data into packets and route them between networks. An 'applications' layer converts the routed data into useful things like files, videos, and web sites. On top of these coded layers, a final 'content' layer comprises all information shared across ICTs. Each layer functions independently; at the application layer, for example, Google Chrome works regardless of whether the link layer employs DSL or 5G.

Much of this behaviour has implications for the international legal order as States now regularly participate in the governance of cyberspace (i.e., regulating the Internet's technical architecture) and governance in cyberspace (i.e., delineating what behaviours to prohibit, permit, or require). As States speak out more, however, it begs a question: what are the implications of international law for the State silence that remains?\nThe particular conception of State silence that forms the focus of this volume is 'reactive State silence' – the absence of physical or verbal acts of a State against the background of someone else's conduct or claim.5 As this volume's introductory chapter notes, reactive State silence may be legally significant in at least three ways: acceptance, iterating the formation or evolution of international law via concepts like acquiescence;6 lack of acceptance, for example indicating that there is no international agreement;7 or opposition, in the sense of resisting the formation or evolution of international law, for example abstaining from ratifying a treaty or voting in the United Nations General Assembly as evidence of a State's resistance to the formation of a customary rule.8\nThe International Law Commission (ILC)'s work on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice suggests silence may constitute 'acceptance ... when the circumstances call for some reaction'.9 Conclusion 10(3) of the ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification elaborates that '[f]ailure to react over time to a practice may serve as evidence of acceptance as law (opinio juris), provided that States were in a position to react and the circumstances called for some reaction'.10 The accompanying ILC commentary delimits circumstances calling for a reaction 'where the practice is one that affects – usually unfavourably – the interests or rights of the State failing or refusing to act'.11 According to the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nILC being ‘in a position to react’ means that ‘the State concerned must have had knowledge of the practice (which includes circumstances where, because of the publicity given to the practice, it must be assumed that the State had such knowledge)’ and that ‘it must have had sufficient time and ability to act’. As such, the ILC concludes that ‘[w]here a State did not or could not have been expected to know of a certain practice, or has not yet had a reasonable time to respond, inaction cannot be attributed to an acknowledgement that such practice was mandated (or permitted) under customary international law’. The present volume centres on surfacing how States and other actors across different fields of international law understand and apply these abstract and context-independent thresholds.\nIn the cyber domain, however, the concept of reactive silence has been itself met with silence. States, courts, and other actors have had virtually (in both senses of the term) nothing to say about these thresholds specifically, or the potential legal salience of reactive State silence generally. The principal exception to this trend is a 2020 statement by the US Department of Defense General Counsel reflecting on whether sovereignty functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace; he suggested that ‘many States’ public silence in the face of countless publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks precludes a conclusion that States have coalesced around a common view that there is an international prohibition against all such operations ...’. Aside from this (brief) remark, we see little mention of any types of circumstances that call for another State’s reaction in the cyber domain, the meaning of a State’s capacity to react in this context, the threshold of knowledge of another State’s practice, or what amounts to a reasonable passage of time to respond.\nAgainst this background, our chapter offers an inaugural assessment of how reactive silence implicates international law-making in cyberspace. We do so through both descriptive and normative lenses. First, as a descriptive matter, we differentiate the absence of reactive silence rhetoric in international law from its factual existence in various contexts. We introduce three cases – (i) Internet governance, (ii) secret/covert State sponsored cyber-operations; and (iii) unilateral statements by States about international law in cyberspace – where we can identify reactive State silences and offer tentative thoughts on their legal\n Id.

Doing so, in turn, provides a foundation for analysing why States and other stakeholders have yet to recognize reactive silence issues in cyber contexts.\nSecond, extant ambiguity about reactive State silence in cyberspace provides grounds for a normative claim: beyond reactive silences, international law would benefit from acknowledging other manifestations of State silence – which we label catalysing and partial silences – to assess international law and cyberspace. Catalysing silence involves the absence of verbal and/or physical acts of States – whether reactive or not – that empower alternative regulatory forms (e.g., voluntary non-binding norms) or authorities (e.g., non-State actor voices about international law). Partial silence involves instances where there is some verbal/physical State response to a claim or conduct (thereby disqualifying it as a ‘reactive silence’) but that reaction remains silent on all relevant international law implications. Like reactive silence, partial silence raises questions of legal salience in terms of acceptance, non-acceptance, and opposition. Thus, we aim to launch a conversation about the capacities and constraints of reactive silence to construct international law in cyberspace while offering additional frames for assessing State silence’s salience to international law overall.\nOur chapter proceeds in four parts. We begin with State silence’s role in the Internet governance context, where it generally catalysed ‘multistakeholder’ governance, with its reactive forms exhibiting acceptance by certain States of that model and opposition to other States’ attempts to supplant it with more conventional (i.e., multilateral) international legal frameworks. (I) Next, we turn to State silence vis-a-vis the rising number of State-sponsored cyber-operations, whose secret and/or covert nature may explain both their popularity and why States are reluctant to catalog them as State practices that constitute circumstances calling for a reaction under international law. (II) In this context, we explore whether partial silences in response to such operations have their own legal salience in terms of avoiding the international environment’s ‘default permissive condition’. We then turn to a new trend where certain States have begun to offer unilateral statements on how international law applies to cyberspace, asking if a State’s reactive silence to such statements (or the failure to publicize its own views) have legal salience to international-law making and who authors it. (III)\nThese case studies lead us to conclude that, although the cyber context may have little to say about reactive State silence and international law at present, the inattention to this topic itself suggests conditions that may implicate whether and when reactive silences garner legal salience: (i) clarity about the relevant legal\n Alexandra Perina, *Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law*, 53 COLUMB.

(IV) Given cyberspace’s status quo, we close with a call for more States to break their silence not only on how international law applies to the cyber domain, but also how to construe any remaining State silences that follow.\n## I. State Silence and Internet Governance\nInternet governance encompasses ‘the design and administration of the technologies necessary to keep the Internet operational and the enactment of substantive policy around these technologies’. It is not ‘a monolithic system’ but ‘a multi-layered system of administration and operational oversight that spans areas as diverse as standards-setting, cybersecurity, and inter-connection arrangements’. At first, most States greeted this topic with silence. Whether out of ignorance or disinterest, most States did not engage with, or even speak about, the Internet’s governing institutions, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which was founded in 1986 and is comprised to this day by technical experts.\nIn contrast to most States, the United States was never completely silent about Internet governance. In 1998, building off its early funding, the U.S. Department of Commerce solicited proposals for an institution to regulate the Internet’s naming and numbering system. The winning candidate was a non-profit entity based in Los Angeles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), that proposed to operate the system via ‘multi-stakeholder governance’ where individuals, non-commercial stakeholder groups, industry, and governments would offer inputs on a community-based, consensus\n LAURA DENARDIS, THE GLOBAL WAR FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE (Yale University Press 2014), at 6.\n Id., at 226.\n The IETF is responsible for designating technical standards and protocols by which the Internet operates. IETF, Missions and Principles, at https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/.\n Common, shared standards and protocols are necessary for connections to occur among today’s billions of digital devices and thousands of networks. For example, the servers used to send and receive things like e-mail each have an Internet protocol (IP) address while each e-mail address has a ‘domain’ name including top-level domains like .com or .edu and then second-level domains; hence, each university has a second-level domain under the top-level .edu domain (e.g., temple.edu). For this system to work, there must be a coordinated effort to distribute and track IP addresses, assign domain names, and oversee protocol parameter identifiers that are used by Internet standards.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ndriven approach. ICANN’s emergence is significant for reflecting on State silence in the cyber domain because, as Milton Mueller explains, ‘ICANN’s original institutional design marked a revolutionary departure from traditional approaches to global governance’ providing ‘one of the few globally centralized points of control over the Internet’. Its mode of governance may be understood as a form of privatization which ‘significantly reduced the power of national governments and existing intergovernmental organizations over communication and information policy’. According to the The Economist, for example, ICANN amounted to a ‘completely new institutional animal [...] a hybrid between an online community and a real-world governance structure, an untested combination [...]: an industry trying to regulate part of itself, across the globe, with little or no input from national governments’. At the same time, as Goldsmith and Wu explain, ICANN remained legally under contract to the US Department of Commerce, which had delegated the day-to-day management of Internet naming and numbering decisions to the organisation. Thus, ‘ICANN’s spirit of ‘self-regulation’ was an appealing label for a process that could be more accurately described as the U.S. government brokering a behind-the-scenes deal that best suited its policy preferences [...] to ensure the stability of the Internet, to fend off the regulatory efforts of foreign governments and international organisations, and to maintain ultimate control’.\nICANN’s establishment can best be characterized as producing reactive silence among States. To be clear, States were not completely silent; in word and deed, they accepted – some more reluctantly than others – ICANN’s authority to govern the Internet’s naming and numbering function pursuant to U.S. domestic law (in addition to its Department of Commerce contract, ICANN was\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nincorporated under California law). Yet, when it came to rhetoric about international law or engagement with international legal institutions, many States remained silent. Although neither States nor commentators have reflected on the precise meaning of this reactive silence, in practice it inescapably amounted to State toleration of an approach to Internet governance that did not directly involve international law.\nStates' initial toleration of ICANN was periodically subject to disruption as 'sovereigns outside the United States perceived it as a threat to their authority'.[27] Three such efforts – and the reactive silence they generated – warrant attention here. An initial disruption period occurred during the UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) – a multilateral series of diplomatic conferences between 2002 and 2005 that sought to address a diversity of issues related to the information society, but which ultimately morphed into a 'battle over the soul of the Internet'.[28] According to Mueller, WSIS witnessed 'a collision between those who saw national governments as the proper agents for defining and implementing international communication and information policy, and those who pursued a more open, pluralistic, and transnational policy-making framework'.[29] For example, China, with the support of a number of Global South countries, proposed to establish an international Internet organisation and adoption of an Internet treaty.[30] Then, before WSIS's second phase in 2005, the United States back-tracked on promises it had made in 1998 to relinquish authority over ICANN (and the 'root' server that executed its naming and numbering functions) in 2006.[31] The European Union responded by proposing that the governance over the domain name system be shifted from ICANN to a UN-affiliated intergovernmental group.[32] Neither the Chinese nor EU proposals succeeded, but they resulted in a compromise where the US and ICANN retained authority over domain names and numbers, but a new Internet Governance Forum was established where States could offer and discuss recommendations concerning Internet policy.[33]\nThe past decade witnessed a second disruptive period as other States and stakeholders revived complaints about U.S. final authority over ICANN and its\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nmultistakeholder approach to Internet governance. The differences had deep conceptual underpinnings over whether cyberspace is a 'space' warranting autonomous regulation or a 'technology' that can be regulated by sovereign nations or the international organizations they create. Supporting the latter frame, States like China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) sought to legitimize a broad statist approach to Internet governance with both technical and content governance dimensions. In terms of technical regulation, these States called for a multilateral organization – the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) – to displace the multistakeholder model of governance embodied by ICANN. In terms of content regulation, under the banner of 'information security' these States sought to legitimize their efforts to monitor and suppress online forms of expression they viewed as a security threat, including expressions of internal dissent and anti-government content. For example, in 2009 the SCO adopted an agreement that defined 'information war' in broad terms as 'dissemination of information harmful to political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other States'.\nBoth the technical and content regulation dimensions of the statist vision for Internet governance were embodied in a draft 'Code of Conduct' that China, Russia and other members of the SCO submitted to the UN General Assembly in 2011 and again in revised form in early 2015. As Eliza Watt notes, the Draft\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\n\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nCodes marked ‘a first step towards the development of a universal document under the auspices of the UN aimed at providing comprehensive information security’. The 2011 Draft Code endorsed ‘the establishment of a multilateral, transparent and democratic international management of the Internet to ensure an equitable distribution of resources, facilitate access for all and ensure a stable and secure functioning of the Internet’. On content regulation, the same text promoted ‘curbing the dissemination of information that incites terrorism, secessionism or extremism or that undermines other countries’ political, economic and social stability, as well as their spiritual and cultural environment’.\nUnsurprisingly, the United States strongly resisted the 2011 Draft Code for fear these proposals would ‘make it easier for governments to suppress free speech’ and ‘legitimize repressive state practices’. Although the 2015 Draft Code purported to reflect revisions ‘taking into full consideration the comments and suggestions from all parties’, its vision and approach remained largely the same. Neither version of the Draft Codes managed to garner sufficient support amongst other States in the international community.\nRussian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, U.N.Doc.

At the WCIT, Russia sought to ensure ITU control over the Internet’s name and numbering system by proposing ITR revisions which provided that ‘Member States shall have equal rights to manage the Internet, including in regard to the allotment, assignment and reclamation of Internet numbering, naming, addressing and identification resources and to support for the operation and development of basic Internet infrastructure’. The United States and European Union Member States resisted and ensured the provision’s removal, alongside a disclaimer in ITR Article 1.1(a) that confirmed the ITRs ‘do not address the content-related aspects of telecommunications’.\nRussia nonetheless managed to secure the inclusion of a separate resolution attached to the treaty text, recognising that ‘all governments should have an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance and for ensuring the stability, security and continuity of the existing Internet and its future development and of the future internet’. This led dozens of States to remain silent on the ITRs by declining to sign and/or ratify them, even as ultimately, a majority of 89 out of 144 ITU Member States adopted the new regulations. The United States explicitly tied its inaction to, inter alia, the ‘provisions on internet governance’.

Through a multi-year process ending in 2016, the United States relinquished its contractual control over ICANN. In its place, ICANN’s stakeholders adopted a revamped, global, multi-stakeholder model of governance (albeit one still incorporated under California law).56\nThe Internet governance context offers four lessons for how we think about State silence generally and reactive State silence in particular. For starters, it contextualizes why there has been so little discussion of reactive State silence and international law in the cyber domain, namely, the absence of international legal mechanisms for governance generally. The emergence of the ICANN multistakeholder regulatory model led to situations where the effects of reactive State silence to both its establishment and attempts to supplant it were so self-evident as to not merit comment. Here, State silence in reaction to ICANN’s emergence inevitably amounted to acceptance (albeit not of the formation or evolution of international law per se), tolerating regulation outside national and multilateral legal structures. At the same time, State silence in reaction to the Draft Codes and the revised ITRs inescapably constituted lack of acceptance or opposition to attempts to supplant the extant multistakeholder model with specific forms of international legal governance.\nSecond, the Internet governance context suggests a need to broaden the backdrop against which international lawyers evaluate State silence. Most existing scholarship has considered ‘reactive’ silence in endogenous terms, examining how State silence impacts obligations or institutions in existing and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nacknowledged international legal regimes. The story of Internet governance highlights an exogenous ‘catalysing’ form of State silence. Instead of impacting international law’s contents, here State silence catalyses the contraction of its contours, fostering or supporting other regulatory models, whether the original U.S. national legal authorities or the current multistakeholder framework.\nMoreover, State silences in response to the Draft Codes also arguably had a catalysing effect. In particular, State silences on Internet governance frameworks both reflected—and to some extent created—space for other regulatory models to take hold, including: (i) private forms of governance (for example, content moderation rules and practices developed by social media companies like Facebook), (ii) non-binding voluntary norms (for example, the Christchurch Call), (iii) regional human rights law (for example, those focused on the permissibility of different models of intermediary liability frameworks), (iv) negotiations for regional regulations (for example, the European Union’s Digital Services Act package and General Data Protection Regulation), and (v) domestic law (for example, intermediary liability laws and constitutional law). The result is today’s regime complex of online content governance that reflects a plurality of regulatory approaches.\nThird, we should be careful to acknowledge that the plurality of regulatory approaches to Internet governance has involved the selective, rather than absolute, absence of international law. For example, while opposing ITU involvement in Internet governance, the United States supported application of World Intellectual Property Organization treaties to the Internet and the adoption of World Trade Organization decisions implicating the cyber domain.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIndeed, through these international legal regimes the United States – together with US technology giants such as Google and Facebook – consolidated a neoliberal model of Internet governance, one with greater emphasis on intellectual property protection, the ‘free flow of information doctrine’, and the collection and monetization of personal data for profit, rather than, for example, data protection and privacy. Similarly, the demise of the Draft Codes did not mean a law-free zone for Internet governance given extant international law regimes empowering State efforts to regulate speech domestically (e.g., prescriptive jurisdiction) or to cabin when and how they may do so (e.g., international human rights provisions on freedom of expression).\nFinally, divisions amongst States highlight the importance of the political context to the interplay among speech acts and silence. In Internet governance, reactive State silence played a stabilizing role that reinforced particular power dynamics. The United States, its allies, and its ‘Big Tech’ companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) flourished under the extant multistakeholder model and preferred its evolution over any ITU substitution. In contrast, States that spoke out were the disrupters, seeking to supplant the ICANN model in favour of a statist vision of Internet governance. In this dynamic, the act of refusing to break silence (e.g., by ratifying a new treaty or endorsing an ITU role) was not only an act of power, but signalled a priority to one collective grouping of States and stakeholders over another.\n## II. State Silence and State-Sponsored Cyber-operations\nAs States gained interest in the architecture by which the Internet operates, they also become interested in how they might employ it for political, military, and intelligence purposes. ICTs offered States a way to operate quickly and (relatively) cheaply on a global scale. They could do so, moreover, both secretly and covertly – the technology affords anonymity to most actors who want it with technical attribution of responsibility to a particular computer system difficult, to say nothing of ascribing responsibility to a human operator or those who direct them. States have taken advantage of these features to conduct various offensive ‘cyber-operations’, including: (i) cyber-attacks that disrupt or disable the availability or integrity of computer systems, networks, or the infrastructure they\n Zalnieriute, supra note 63, at 63-65; see also Henning Lahmann, On the Politics and Ideologies of the Sovereignty Discourse in Cyberspace, 32 DUKE J.

Many of these operations involve 'proxies', further complicating efforts to delimit online activity under the direction or control of a State.\nThe secret and covert nature of State and State-sponsored cyber-operations complicates any assessment of associated silences. Importantly, neither secrecy nor covertness are uniform concepts. It is important, for example, to differentiate deep and shallow secret cyber-operations. Deep secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence is not yet publicly known. Shallow secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence becomes publicly known – for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or other actors' detection – but whose content remains obscured. In addition, a distinction may be drawn between non-covert, covert, and quasi-covert cyber-operations. Non-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State officially acknowledged by the acting State. Covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are officially unacknowledged by the acting State. Quasi-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are either acknowledged in part, acknowledged at some point after taking place, or reported and hypothetically justified without official acknowledgements by the acting State.\nCyber-operations are, by design, almost always meant to occur unobserved, and, if observed, be unattributable to, or at least unacknowledged\n See, e.g., Herbert Lin &amp; Jackie Kerr, On Cyber-Enabled Information/Influence Warfare and Manipulation, in P. CORNISH (Ed.), THE OXFORD HANDBOOK ON CYBERSECURITY (OUP 2022); Herbert S. Lin, Offensive Cyber-operations and the Use of Force, 4 J. NAT'L SECURITY L. &amp; POL'Y 63 (2010). In addition, States engage in a range of 'defensive' behaviours on-line some of which, like the US 'defend forward' policy may be perceived by their targets as offensive in character.

Deep secret cyber-operations thus raise a cyber version of the proverbial question of whether a tree that falls in the forest makes a sound when there is no one there to hear it? If a cyber-operation never comes to light, we might characterize the silence that accompanies it as non-reactive – to use the language of the ILC, it is difficult to see how a State could be characterised as being ‘in a position to react’ to a cyber-operation where the State lacks ‘knowledge’ of it.71 Still, there are intermediate postures between entirely unknown cyber behaviours and public and acknowledged acts where a potential for reactions (and thus, reactive silences) arise. A State may be able to observe (or believe it knows of) another State’s covert cyber-operation and decline to respond.\nAt the same time, surveying State silences in response to hostile cyber-operations that have become publicly known to date, we see value in expanding the scope of State reactions beyond such cases of complete silence (where a State offers no responsive speech, behaviour, or engagement). Secret and covert cyber-operations have highlighted the potential for what we call partial silence—explicit State speech, behaviour, or engagements in response to a cyber-operation, which is silent either with respect to international law in general or as to the specific norms of international law implicated.72\nAn example of complete silence is Iran’s initial response to the Stuxnet cyber-operation. When its centrifuges began spinning out of control in 2008, Iran had no reaction, apparently on the assumption that the failure stemmed from internal operating problems rather than external causes.73 It took years for Iran to break its complete silence by characterising the incident as a ‘massive cyber-attack’ and accusing the US and Israel of deploying the malicious computer worm, albeit without any suggestion that it was an internationally wrongful act.74\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn recent years, such a partial silence in response to hostile cyber-operations has become increasingly common.75 Sometimes, States have responded by publicly attributing cyber-operations to other States without condemnation. For example, the only US public response to the 2014-2015 massive data theft from the Office of Personnel Management was admiration – James Clapper, then-head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, remarked that ‘you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did’.76\nOther times, States have condemned the behaviour of other States whilst remaining silent as to the incident’s characterisation under international law. US Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, suggested that the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated North Korea’s ‘flagrant disregard for international norms’,77 while US President Obama similarly avoided international law language in characterising Russia’s cyber information operation on the 2016 US presidential election as a ‘violation of established norms of behaviour’.78 These partial silences persist even where condemnations take a coordinated form. For instance, in response to the 2017 spread of WannaCry malware (which disrupted the functioning of hundreds of thousands of computers across over 150 States), the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing the cyber-attack to North Korea and condemning its behaviour without mentioning international law at all.79\nthat Iran had detected a planned “massive cyber-attack” against its nuclear facilities, blaming the United States, Israel and Britain’).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn one exceptional case, States did publicly combine an attribution of hostile cyber-operations to another State with claims they were violative of international law (whilst remaining silent as to which specific rules of international law were violated). In October 2018, the UK and its allies exposed and condemned a series of cyber-operations conducted by the Russian military intelligence service against political institutions, businesses, media outlets, and an international sports agency. The UK Foreign Secretary suggested that ‘this pattern of behaviour demonstrates [Russia’s] desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences’. The Netherlands suggested these activities ‘undermine the international rule of law’, while Canada’s statement made clear that Russia’s malicious cyber activities ‘demonstrate a disregard for international law and undermine the rules-based international order’. None of these accusations delineated whether all of the GRU’s alleged operations violated international law or if only some did; nor did they elaborate which international laws were violated.\nIn short, both victim and third States are almost always completely or partially silent in response to hostile cyber-operations. As Efrony and Shany note, there is currently ‘so little in the practice of victim States to indicate that [their international legal rights] actually guide their conduct when confronted by cyber-operations’. For our purposes, it is just as important to note the pervasive\nLongergan, What Makes This Attribution of Chinese Hacking Different, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT (July 22, 2021).\nSee UK National Cyber Security Centre, Reckless campaign of cyber-attacks by Russian military intelligence service exposed, PRESS RELEASE (Oct. 4, 2018) ('flagrant violation of international law'); see also Council of the EU, Joint statement by Presidents Tusk and Juncker and High Representative Mogherini on Russian cyber-attacks, PRESS RELEASE (Oct. 4, 2018) ('We deplore such actions, which undermine international law and international institutions'); Prime Minister of Australia, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, Media Release: Attribution of a Pattern of Malicious Cyber Activity to Russia (Oct. 4, 2018) ('contrary to the consensus on international law and norms'); see also Jeffrey Biller and Michael Schmitt, Un-caging the Bear?

Why have States been so reticent to invoke the vocabulary of international law or assess any legal salience in their silences?\nOne possibility may be that victim States assume the secret and/or covert nature of hostile cyber-operations negates their characterisation as a practice that calls for a reaction. While the development of international law generally occurs through the practice of a few ‘movers and shakers’ in combination with the reactive silence of a larger number of passive States, not all reactive State silences are legally salient. Here, it may be significant that there has generally been silence accompanying the hostile cyber-operations themselves, whether in their secrecy (which ‘may obscure the practice itself, or any related, internally held opinio juris’) or their covertness, (where even if the acts become a shallow secret—publicly known, for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or detection by other actors—acting States uniformly decline to acknowledge their authorship).\nIt is commonly asserted that State acts must be public to qualify as state practice. According to the International Law Association’s (ILA) Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, for example, ‘a secret physical act [...] is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tried to assert that its conduct was legally justified’. This suggests that a State conducting cyber-operations that remain deep secrets or, if discovered, remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by the State alleged to have conducted it), will ‘cede its voice and weight of its practice in the development of the law’.

And if there’s no legally relevant practice, there is nothing to which the victim State must respond (whether via acquiescence or in opposition). Under this approach, reactive silences would only have legal effects if the accused State itself attempted to acknowledge its behaviour (a move that has yet to occur in cyberspace as States rarely, if ever, explicitly acknowledge specific cyber-operations as their own).\nWhatever the strength of such logic, the fact that States have yet to express it leaves open the possibility that other actors may assign legal salience to their reactive silences, even those that are partial in nature. The ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification, for example, suggest that for practice to contribute to the formation and identification of customary international law, it is sufficient for it to ‘be known to other States (whether or not it is publicly available)’, adding that ‘it is difficult to see how confidential conduct by a State could serve such a purpose unless and until it is known to other States’. Similarly, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law claims that ‘in order to count, practice has to be public or communicated to some extent’, a requirement that can be fulfilled once the practice is ‘communicated to one other State or relevant international organization including the ICRC’, even communications made to the ICRC in confidence. On this view, for secret and/or covert cyber-operations to constitute conditions calling for a reaction it may suffice for them to ‘be known to other States’, even if they remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by States alleged to have conducted them).\nFrom this perspective, there follows the possibility of investing legal salience in a State’s reactive silence to at least some types of secret or covert cyber-operations. For instance, a complete reactive silence to a shallow secret operation could be deemed acceptance based on the ILC’s endorsement of the idea that practices may be deemed evidence of opinio juris where it represents\n BUCHAN, supra note 91, at 154, 164.

Whether or not States currently condemn hostile cyber accusations in explicitly legal terms, can signalling disapproval of such acts (as US President Biden did recently with respect to Chinese cyber-espionage) counter-act claims the accused State’s operations are (or are becoming) permitted by international law—in other words, counter-act any notion that such practices are being tolerated?\nAlternatively, individual reactive partial silences might accumulate in scale over time to generate what is deemed to be a de facto collective acceptance of the practice of various cyber-operations. In other words, if States’ usage over time continuously denounces cyber-operations as unwanted but not internationally unlawful, might States at some point infer international law does not prohibit such acts—or at the least, transform a ‘real rule’ of international law into a ‘paper rule’. Under this reasoning, partial silences would be read literally, suggesting the underlying behaviour is, as the colloquial saying goes, ‘awful but lawful’. According to Perina, for example, ‘[s]hallowly secret covert activity that is tolerated by the international community encourages in both the covert actors and third States the practice of covert behavior, as it confirms that the political costs of covertness are low’.\nSuch a view aligns with those who view espionage as either a lawful exception to otherwise unlawful acts or outside international law’s purview entirely (especially where victim States consistently object to espionage on political grounds or claim violations of national laws without international legal objections). The US Department of Defense General Counsel’s 2020 statement suggests such reasoning, rejecting the idea that sovereignty always functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace given so many States’ complete or partially silent reactions to countless cases of publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks. This view might, of course, be characterized as giving international law a permissive content as to State sponsored cyber-operations.\n See supra note 10 and accompanying text.\n See White House Press Release, supra note 79.\n Perina, supra note 15, at 576 (citing Michael J Glennon, How International Rules Die, 93 GEORGETOWN L. J. 939, 953, 956 (2005).\n Perina, supra note 15, at 579; see also ARONSSON-STORRIER, supra note 69, at 137-141 (critiquing the notion that publicly known, but unacknowledged, acts to which states remain silent should be considered legally salient).\n See Ney, supra note 14 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nBut like espionage, it may also represent a catalysing silence, shifting the conduct beyond international law’s purview.\nAbsent rhetoric (let alone doctrine) on reactive silences in cyberspace, it is difficult to know what legal meaning – none, opposition, acceptance – to assign to complete or partially silent reactions to State cyber-operations. Such ambiguity counsels States to clarify how their silences should be understood in different circumstances to mitigate the possibility of other actors misconstruing and assigning meaning to them. In doing so, however, we must recognize the challenge of agency. Assigning any legal salience to silence, whether as acceptance or not, risks marginalizing those States prone to silence, not because of any legal position, but because they may lack the time, knowledge, or capabilities to determine how best to legally characterise hostile cyber-operations, to say nothing of State interests in avoiding engagements that may trigger involvements with opposing hegemonic actors.\n## III. State Silences and State Statements on the Application of International Law to Cyber-operations\nSo far, we have assumed at least some international legal regulation of State-sponsored cyber-operations. But that has not always been a safe assumption. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, even as States became more interested (and capable) in conducting cyber-operations, they remained silent on the relevant international legal frameworks governing that behaviour. The effect of such\n The same outcome may follow the first option proposed above, denying any legal salience to secret or covert cyber-operations. See supra notes 86-92, and accompanying text. Interestingly, therefore, partial silences are only non-catalysing where their legal content is inferred despite its explicit absence. See supra notes 93-97 and accompanying text.\n Elisabeth Schweiger, Targeted Killing and the Lack of Acquiescence, 32 LEIDEN J.

In 2018, however, Russia proposed States negotiate a treaty to regulate information weapons; the idea received a cool reception from Western states worried that doing so would green-light constraints on privacy and freedom of expression. See Letter dated September 23, 1998 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations concerning Agenda Item 63, U.N. Doc. A/C.1/53/3 (1998). Since then, the Council of Europe concluded a treaty on cyber-crime and discussions are ongoing at the UN for a global cybercrime convention. But aside from these examples (and an African Union treaty that has yet to enter into force), international law offers few cyber-specific conventional regulations. See, e.g., Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, Nov. 23, 2001) CETS No 185; UNGA Press Release, General Assembly Adopts Resolution Outlining Terms\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nsilence was, however, far from clear. Did ICT's novelties suggest States should regard cyber-operations, like Internet governance, as largely outside international law's purview, as a case of non liquet, or subject to pre-existing general public international law rules and principles in the absence of overt objections to doing so? As the first edition of the Tallinn Manual summarized it:\nThe threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how. Views on the subject range from a full application of the law of armed conflict, along the lines of the International Court of Justice's pronouncement that it applies to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' to strict application of the Permanent Court of International Justice's pronouncement that acts not forbidden in international law are generally permitted.\nIn 2013, a consensus report by a UN Group of Governmental Experts ('UN GGE') affirmed international law's general applicability. Since then, that position has been reiterated by the UN General Assembly and various regional international organizations.\nThe resolution of existential questions about international law's application overall, however, merely opened the door to debates over which international laws applied. For example, several states, but principally China, resisted accepting any application of international humanitarian law to online behaviours, arguing that doing so would accelerate the Internet's\nfor Negotiating Cybercrime Treaty amid Concerns over 'Rushed' Vote at Expense of Further Consultations, UN Doc. 12328 (May 26, 2021).\n See Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Sousa Dias, Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond, EJILTALK!

Other existing international law doctrines and mechanisms (e.g., due diligence, countermeasures) encountered similar challenges.\nIn 2012, the United States began to elaborate its official views on how international law applies to cyberspace via a series of public statements.

Over 25 States have now offered national views on international law’s application to cyberspace and a UN Open Ended Working Group ('OEWG') has called for all States to do so.\nFor all the attention such statements garnered, much less has been devoted to the reactive silence they received.

How should international law assess these silences? For those who insist that generally applicable international law rules already bind States in cyberspace, it might follow that these statements have no salience. Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita Dias, for example, emphasize that\nInternational legal rules or principles of general applicability, i.e., applicable under general international law to all types of state activity in the relevant circumstances, such as the prohibition on the use of force, non-intervention, the Corfu Channel rule of 'due diligence', international human rights law and international humanitarian law, thus, do not need further proof of applicability to ICTs or other new technologies via specific state practice and opinio juris 'in cyberspace'. Their scope is sufficiently broad to be interpreted and applied to ICTs. It is the burden of those advocating for ICTs' exclusion from their scope to present evidence that states, in their general practice accepted as law, have actively carved out ICTs.\nTaking this view one step further, it might be possible to reason that State statements about international law applications are not a constitutive element of customary international law online; and if that is the case, reactive silence to such statements similarly lacks legal salience.\nFor some, however, cyberspace's novelties require States to elaborate new state practice and opinio juris before ascribing legal obligations to States. Consider the views of Israel's Deputy Attorney General:\nIt cannot be automatically presumed that a customary rule applicable in any of the physical domains is also applicable to the cyber domain. The key question in identifying State practice is whether the practice which arose in other domains is closely related to the activity envisaged in the cyber domain. Additionally, it must be ascertained that the opinio juris which gave rise to the customary rules applicable in other domains was not domain-specific. Given the unique characteristics of the cyber domain, such an analysis is to be made with particular prudence, as it is very often the case that relevant differences exist.\nFor supporters of the domain-specific approach, State statements have value as opinio juris, begging the question if they therefore qualify as circumstances calling for a reaction?\n States have, however, been more vocal in accepting international institutional views on the applicability of international law. See, e.g., Italy, Position Paper on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), ¶3 (concurring with UN GGE and OEWG conclusions on international law's applicability to cyberspace).\n Akande et al., supra note 104.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nWhere State statements have legal salience, their context could signal the audience's acceptance of what the statements say. For some, this conclusion may follow from the technology itself; unlike earlier eras, State views can now be easily expressed, distributed, and aggregated for purposes of assessing *opinio juris*. Such capacities may favour considering official State statements as a circumstance calling for a reaction. Alternatively, the case for acceptance finds support among ‘specially affected’ States who themselves have the capacity to engage in the same cyber-operations subject to these statements. As Kevin Heller explains, even if silence as consent is controversial, ‘there seems to be widespread acceptance of the idea that specially-affected states, unlike states that are not specially affected, have an obligation to object to a claim concerning the customary status of a practice—and that their silence should be considered support if they do not’.\nThere are, however, countervailing possibilities. States may remain silent to avoid giving the statement the further credibility a response might imply. Or, they may remain silent to avoid the geopolitical fray that aligning with one set of state views or another would entail. Some States also clearly have capacity constraints, both in understanding how cyber-operations work and around the relevant international legal issues they raise. Assigning these silences legal salience risks overburdening States by suggesting they must monitor for, and respond to, the views of all the 190+ nation states whenever they choose to\n For an example of this in practice, see Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, et al., *Mapping States’ Reactions to the U.S. Strikes Against Syria of April 2018–A Comprehensive Guide*, JUST SECURITY (May 7, 2018).\n Evolutions in machine learning are likely to only enhance such capabilities.

Some Member States indicated a reluctance to make similar signals lest they embroil that State in the competition and conflict among these actors; issues States can avoid by staying silent’).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nspeak. Limiting response obligations to specially affected States (assuming that category can even be identified and the relevant states so designated) could mitigate such concerns, but the secret and covert nature of cyber capacities suggests States may resist conceding capacities for fear it might remove some of their advantages. Big data and machine learning may someday lessen these constraints and equalize state capacities, but those days have yet to arrive. Today, drawing inferences from State silence more likely implicates the agency issues raised above; requiring States to speak out (whether to endorse or oppose other States' statements) involves a political act that would mostly just affirm the power of the States speaking.\nWhatever the legal salience of the ‘reactive’ silence States have offered other States’ statements, it would be a mistake to ignore the silence evident in the more than 150 States who have yet to affirmatively offer their own views on how international law applies in cyberspace. Even if not reactive, such silences appear catalysing. They create space for non-State actors to fill the silence with their own views. The two *Tallinn Manuals* and the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross serve as the most prominent examples. As ‘first movers’, the positions expressed in these efforts have remained influential even among States that decide to break their silence. Thus, even though Germany declined to endorse the second *Tallinn Manual* in its entirety, its own later statement repeatedly and expressly concurs with its views. Nor is silence’s catalysing effect limited to academic experts. In the landmark surveillance case, *Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v. the UK*, the European Court of Human Rights was able to assess the compliance of the UK’s extraterritorial surveillance regime with the European Convention on Human Rights on ‘the assumption’ that the matters\n On challenges of human and financial resources of Third World states with respect to customary international law, see B.S.

Non-state actors may also take the lead in pushing for state action; witness, Microsoft President Brad Smith calling on states in 2017 to adopt a ‘Digital Geneva Convention’. See Brad Smith, *The Need for a Digital Geneva Convention*, RSA Conference (Feb. 14, 2017).\n See 2021 GGE Report, *supra* note 112, Annex, at 33, 35.

Stymied over how to articulate international law applications in cyberspace, a 2015 UN GGE identified eleven non-binding ‘voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour’. These norms purport to establish shared expectations of appropriate future behaviour in cyberspace that do not depend on law to establish their logic of appropriateness. The precise relationship between these norm promotion efforts and international law is unclear. The 2021 OEWG report clarified these ‘norms do not replace or alter States’ obligations or rights under international law, which are binding, but rather provide additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs’, whilst also noting these ‘[n]orms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law’. The fact remains, however, that subsequent state endorsements of these norms are often partially silent – they do not address whether and which voluntary norms codify pre-existing international legal rules and standards.\nIV. Conclusion\nAt first glance, the cyber context has little to contribute to a volume on reactive State silence. Except for one passing comment by a Trump Administration official, there is no relevant international legal discourse on ‘circumstances that call for a reaction’ in cyberspace. States have yet to talk about silence’s salience and there are no court opinions (international or domestic) that raise the topic. Thus, we do not know whether, when, or how reactive silence constructs\n Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v.

As such, we lack requisite evidence to address many of this volume's research questions. We do not know if the work of non-State actors (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals) or institutional fora (e.g., UN GGE reports) call for a reaction by States, nor whether a legal (viz. a political) claim is necessary to do so. Without recognition of the existence of reactive silences, let alone their thresholds, we have little to say about questions of consistency for purposes of law-production or if the technologies that ICTs represent can impact findings of acquiescence or non-acceptance.\nOn closer examination, however, cyberspace may inform our understanding of State silences in at least three ways. First and foremost, it highlights the importance of distinguishing international legal rhetoric about silence from the fact of its existence. Even if States and other stakeholders have yet to acknowledge it explicitly, our case studies of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law reveal an array of contexts where States have reacted with silence to the claims or conduct of others. Identifying these instances of silence opens the door to the very sorts of interpretations and interactions that have evolved reactive silence in other legal fields. We thus see our chapter as a modest, opening move – an invitation to others to identify and examine incidents of reactive silence in cyberspace and to assess whether they have legal salience, and, if so, whether, when and how they might constitute acceptance, non-acceptance, or opposition.\nSecond, the very inattention reactive silence has received in addressing international law and cyberspace warrants attention. It may, of course, be simply a feature of the field's immaturity that will gradually resolve over time. On the other hand, there may be certain contextual conditions in cyberspace whose existence obstructs any role for reactive silence. Hence, in opening the door to discuss State silences in cyberspace, we also invite consideration of whether and which conditions explain the current silence on State silence.\nConsider, for example, questions of clarity about the existence and meaning of international law itself. Might legal salience for reactive silence require some baseline consensus about what international laws exist or mean in the cyber context before we can assume anything about ensuing silences? Similarly, our discussion of secret and/or covert cyber-operations suggests that reactive silence may depend on some measure of transparency – acknowledged or at least known conduct to which others may react. Does the fact that the underlying behaviour is itself conducted in silence restrict international law's ability to assign value to any reactions, including silence? But even if we could make State behaviours in cyberspace more transparent, questions remain about each State's capacity to\n See Ch. 1, at xx-xx.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nunderstand the technology, how it works, and what it means for international law generally, let alone reactive silences in particular? At present, cyberspace is rife with capacity questions as the vast majority of States lack sufficient understanding of ICTs as a technical matter, leaving them behind or outside the conduct and conversations of more tech-savvy actors. Assigning silences legal salience in such contexts may not only be difficult but normatively questionable if it enables a form of legal imperialism by those with the most capability to act at the expense of most States who are targeted and/or victimized by other States' behaviour online. The ICT context also suggests that the status quo's susceptibility to change may impact recognition of reactive silences. Given the Internet's dynamic nature, with ICTs constantly evolving (and with them the means and methods by which States operate), it may be difficult to ascribe legal value to responses, silent or otherwise, especially, if at the time, the underlying claims or conduct quickly become outdated or obsolete.\nMore research is needed to assess if clarity, transparency, capability, and/or susceptibility help explain the current silence about State silence in cyberspace. In doing so, we would also invite assessments of whether these conditions may have explanatory value for the state of reactive silence in other areas of international law. Our list is not, however, in any way exhaustive – we would expect that in cyberspace as in other contexts, additional conditions may impact or control reactive silence's contours and contents.\nThird, whatever roles reactive silence occupies in cyberspace, our treatments of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law suggest the utility of additional perspectives on silences. Our treatment has highlighted two – (i) partial silences where silence is broken in reaction to some conduct or claims but silence about international law itself remains; and (ii) catalysing silences where the absence of claims or conduct involving international law trigger or otherwise facilitate non-international legal institutions (e.g., multistakeholder governance models like ICANN) or norms (e.g., the UN GGE's 11 voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour). State silence may also facilitate non-State actor voices within international law (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals).\nAt present, moreover, we believe both partial and catalysing silences have a much larger impact on the construction of international law in cyberspace than reactive silence. As such, we would call for more attention to these silences across international law more generally to see what impacts, if any, they have had on the law's formation, operation, or efficacy.\nState silence may have been a feature of the early Internet, impacting its evolution and, in turn, the availability of international law and international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ninstitutions. Today, in contrast, States are speaking about—and acting in—cyberspace with ever-greater attention and intensity. Rather than diminishing the importance of State silence, however, these voices (and their identities) demand more attention to the legal salience and implications of the silence that remains. Thus, the time is ripe for States to begin to talk about their silence in cyberspace. States and scholars now need to understand when silence can reinforce, rather than undermine, the regulation of the Internet as an open, stable, and secure space for human flourishing and peaceful coexistence among States.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718",

HOLLIS\nBARRIE SANDER\nCyberspace emerged amidst State silence. Although one State—the United States—played a key role in funding the information and communication technologies (ICTs) that evolved into the modern Internet, it was largely developed by university academics and, later, commercial enterprises. There was little input from other States, who were unaware—or uninterested—in the nascent technology and its potential risks and rewards.\nSuch silence stands in contrast to the prevalence of States' verbal and physical acts in and about cyberspace today. Cyberspace's rising priority along humanitarian, economic, political, and military lines has spawned an array of\n A socio-technical institution, cyberspace involves a multi-layered assemblage of hardware, software, and networks that store and exchange data, including chiefly the Internet. Various ways exist to describe these layers. The bottom 'link' layer includes the physical hardware/media used to access the Internet. The next three layers involve coding – 'network' and 'transport' layers break data into packets and route them between networks. An 'applications' layer converts the routed data into useful things like files, videos, and web sites. On top of these coded layers, a final 'content' layer comprises all information shared across ICTs. Each layer functions independently; at the application layer, for example, Google Chrome works regardless of whether the link layer employs DSL or 5G.

POST, IN SEARCH OF JEFFERSON'S MOOSE 80-90 (OUP 2009).\n By silence, we mean the absence of verbal and/or physical acts of States as detailed in Danae Azaria's introductory chapter to this volume: The Silence of States Across International Law, Ch. 1, at xx.\n See Duncan B.

Much of this behaviour has implications for the international legal order as States now regularly participate in the governance of cyberspace (i.e., regulating the Internet's technical architecture) and governance in cyberspace (i.e., delineating what behaviours to prohibit, permit, or require). As States speak out more, however, it begs a question: what are the implications of international law for the State silence that remains?\nThe particular conception of State silence that forms the focus of this volume is 'reactive State silence' – the absence of physical or verbal acts of a State against the background of someone else's conduct or claim.5 As this volume's introductory chapter notes, reactive State silence may be legally significant in at least three ways: acceptance, iterating the formation or evolution of international law via concepts like acquiescence;6 lack of acceptance, for example indicating that there is no international agreement;7 or opposition, in the sense of resisting the formation or evolution of international law, for example abstaining from ratifying a treaty or voting in the United Nations General Assembly as evidence of a State's resistance to the formation of a customary rule.8\nThe International Law Commission (ILC)'s work on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice suggests silence may constitute 'acceptance ... when the circumstances call for some reaction'.9 Conclusion 10(3) of the ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification elaborates that '[f]ailure to react over time to a practice may serve as evidence of acceptance as law (opinio juris), provided that States were in a position to react and the circumstances called for some reaction'.10 The accompanying ILC commentary delimits circumstances calling for a reaction 'where the practice is one that affects – usually unfavourably – the interests or rights of the State failing or refusing to act'.11 According to the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nILC being ‘in a position to react’ means that ‘the State concerned must have had knowledge of the practice (which includes circumstances where, because of the publicity given to the practice, it must be assumed that the State had such knowledge)’ and that ‘it must have had sufficient time and ability to act’. As such, the ILC concludes that ‘[w]here a State did not or could not have been expected to know of a certain practice, or has not yet had a reasonable time to respond, inaction cannot be attributed to an acknowledgement that such practice was mandated (or permitted) under customary international law’. The present volume centres on surfacing how States and other actors across different fields of international law understand and apply these abstract and context-independent thresholds.\nIn the cyber domain, however, the concept of reactive silence has been itself met with silence. States, courts, and other actors have had virtually (in both senses of the term) nothing to say about these thresholds specifically, or the potential legal salience of reactive State silence generally. The principal exception to this trend is a 2020 statement by the US Department of Defense General Counsel reflecting on whether sovereignty functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace; he suggested that ‘many States’ public silence in the face of countless publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks precludes a conclusion that States have coalesced around a common view that there is an international prohibition against all such operations ...’. Aside from this (brief) remark, we see little mention of any types of circumstances that call for another State’s reaction in the cyber domain, the meaning of a State’s capacity to react in this context, the threshold of knowledge of another State’s practice, or what amounts to a reasonable passage of time to respond.\nAgainst this background, our chapter offers an inaugural assessment of how reactive silence implicates international law-making in cyberspace. We do so through both descriptive and normative lenses. First, as a descriptive matter, we differentiate the absence of reactive silence rhetoric in international law from its factual existence in various contexts. We introduce three cases – (i) Internet governance, (ii) secret/covert State sponsored cyber-operations; and (iii) unilateral statements by States about international law in cyberspace – where we can identify reactive State silences and offer tentative thoughts on their legal\n Id.

Doing so, in turn, provides a foundation for analysing why States and other stakeholders have yet to recognize reactive silence issues in cyber contexts.\nSecond, extant ambiguity about reactive State silence in cyberspace provides grounds for a normative claim: beyond reactive silences, international law would benefit from acknowledging other manifestations of State silence – which we label catalysing and partial silences – to assess international law and cyberspace. Catalysing silence involves the absence of verbal and/or physical acts of States – whether reactive or not – that empower alternative regulatory forms (e.g., voluntary non-binding norms) or authorities (e.g., non-State actor voices about international law). Partial silence involves instances where there is some verbal/physical State response to a claim or conduct (thereby disqualifying it as a ‘reactive silence’) but that reaction remains silent on all relevant international law implications. Like reactive silence, partial silence raises questions of legal salience in terms of acceptance, non-acceptance, and opposition. Thus, we aim to launch a conversation about the capacities and constraints of reactive silence to construct international law in cyberspace while offering additional frames for assessing State silence’s salience to international law overall.\nOur chapter proceeds in four parts. We begin with State silence’s role in the Internet governance context, where it generally catalysed ‘multistakeholder’ governance, with its reactive forms exhibiting acceptance by certain States of that model and opposition to other States’ attempts to supplant it with more conventional (i.e., multilateral) international legal frameworks. (I) Next, we turn to State silence vis-a-vis the rising number of State-sponsored cyber-operations, whose secret and/or covert nature may explain both their popularity and why States are reluctant to catalog them as State practices that constitute circumstances calling for a reaction under international law. (II) In this context, we explore whether partial silences in response to such operations have their own legal salience in terms of avoiding the international environment’s ‘default permissive condition’. We then turn to a new trend where certain States have begun to offer unilateral statements on how international law applies to cyberspace, asking if a State’s reactive silence to such statements (or the failure to publicize its own views) have legal salience to international-law making and who authors it. (III)\nThese case studies lead us to conclude that, although the cyber context may have little to say about reactive State silence and international law at present, the inattention to this topic itself suggests conditions that may implicate whether and when reactive silences garner legal salience: (i) clarity about the relevant legal\n Alexandra Perina, *Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law*, 53 COLUMB.

TRANSNAT’L L. 507, 576 (2015).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nrules; (ii) transparency about relevant State behaviour; (iii) capability in terms of understanding the underlying claims or conduct; and (iv) susceptibility for circumstances to change rapidly. (IV) Given cyberspace’s status quo, we close with a call for more States to break their silence not only on how international law applies to the cyber domain, but also how to construe any remaining State silences that follow.\n## I. State Silence and Internet Governance\nInternet governance encompasses ‘the design and administration of the technologies necessary to keep the Internet operational and the enactment of substantive policy around these technologies’. It is not ‘a monolithic system’ but ‘a multi-layered system of administration and operational oversight that spans areas as diverse as standards-setting, cybersecurity, and inter-connection arrangements’. At first, most States greeted this topic with silence. Whether out of ignorance or disinterest, most States did not engage with, or even speak about, the Internet’s governing institutions, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which was founded in 1986 and is comprised to this day by technical experts.\nIn contrast to most States, the United States was never completely silent about Internet governance. In 1998, building off its early funding, the U.S. Department of Commerce solicited proposals for an institution to regulate the Internet’s naming and numbering system. The winning candidate was a non-profit entity based in Los Angeles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), that proposed to operate the system via ‘multi-stakeholder governance’ where individuals, non-commercial stakeholder groups, industry, and governments would offer inputs on a community-based, consensus\n LAURA DENARDIS, THE GLOBAL WAR FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE (Yale University Press 2014), at 6.\n Id., at 226.\n The IETF is responsible for designating technical standards and protocols by which the Internet operates. IETF, Missions and Principles, at https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/.\n Common, shared standards and protocols are necessary for connections to occur among today’s billions of digital devices and thousands of networks. For example, the servers used to send and receive things like e-mail each have an Internet protocol (IP) address while each e-mail address has a ‘domain’ name including top-level domains like .com or .edu and then second-level domains; hence, each university has a second-level domain under the top-level .edu domain (e.g., temple.edu). For this system to work, there must be a coordinated effort to distribute and track IP addresses, assign domain names, and oversee protocol parameter identifiers that are used by Internet standards.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ndriven approach. ICANN’s emergence is significant for reflecting on State silence in the cyber domain because, as Milton Mueller explains, ‘ICANN’s original institutional design marked a revolutionary departure from traditional approaches to global governance’ providing ‘one of the few globally centralized points of control over the Internet’. Its mode of governance may be understood as a form of privatization which ‘significantly reduced the power of national governments and existing intergovernmental organizations over communication and information policy’. According to the The Economist, for example, ICANN amounted to a ‘completely new institutional animal [...] a hybrid between an online community and a real-world governance structure, an untested combination [...]: an industry trying to regulate part of itself, across the globe, with little or no input from national governments’. At the same time, as Goldsmith and Wu explain, ICANN remained legally under contract to the US Department of Commerce, which had delegated the day-to-day management of Internet naming and numbering decisions to the organisation. Thus, ‘ICANN’s spirit of ‘self-regulation’ was an appealing label for a process that could be more accurately described as the U.S. government brokering a behind-the-scenes deal that best suited its policy preferences [...] to ensure the stability of the Internet, to fend off the regulatory efforts of foreign governments and international organisations, and to maintain ultimate control’.\nICANN’s establishment can best be characterized as producing reactive silence among States. To be clear, States were not completely silent; in word and deed, they accepted – some more reluctantly than others – ICANN’s authority to govern the Internet’s naming and numbering function pursuant to U.S. domestic law (in addition to its Department of Commerce contract, ICANN was\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nincorporated under California law). Yet, when it came to rhetoric about international law or engagement with international legal institutions, many States remained silent. Although neither States nor commentators have reflected on the precise meaning of this reactive silence, in practice it inescapably amounted to State toleration of an approach to Internet governance that did not directly involve international law.\nStates' initial toleration of ICANN was periodically subject to disruption as 'sovereigns outside the United States perceived it as a threat to their authority'.[27] Three such efforts – and the reactive silence they generated – warrant attention here. An initial disruption period occurred during the UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) – a multilateral series of diplomatic conferences between 2002 and 2005 that sought to address a diversity of issues related to the information society, but which ultimately morphed into a 'battle over the soul of the Internet'.[28] According to Mueller, WSIS witnessed 'a collision between those who saw national governments as the proper agents for defining and implementing international communication and information policy, and those who pursued a more open, pluralistic, and transnational policy-making framework'.[29] For example, China, with the support of a number of Global South countries, proposed to establish an international Internet organisation and adoption of an Internet treaty.[30] Then, before WSIS's second phase in 2005, the United States back-tracked on promises it had made in 1998 to relinquish authority over ICANN (and the 'root' server that executed its naming and numbering functions) in 2006.[31] The European Union responded by proposing that the governance over the domain name system be shifted from ICANN to a UN-affiliated intergovernmental group.[32] Neither the Chinese nor EU proposals succeeded, but they resulted in a compromise where the US and ICANN retained authority over domain names and numbers, but a new Internet Governance Forum was established where States could offer and discuss recommendations concerning Internet policy.[33]\nThe past decade witnessed a second disruptive period as other States and stakeholders revived complaints about U.S. final authority over ICANN and its\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nmultistakeholder approach to Internet governance. The differences had deep conceptual underpinnings over whether cyberspace is a 'space' warranting autonomous regulation or a 'technology' that can be regulated by sovereign nations or the international organizations they create. Supporting the latter frame, States like China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) sought to legitimize a broad statist approach to Internet governance with both technical and content governance dimensions. In terms of technical regulation, these States called for a multilateral organization – the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) – to displace the multistakeholder model of governance embodied by ICANN. In terms of content regulation, under the banner of 'information security' these States sought to legitimize their efforts to monitor and suppress online forms of expression they viewed as a security threat, including expressions of internal dissent and anti-government content. For example, in 2009 the SCO adopted an agreement that defined 'information war' in broad terms as 'dissemination of information harmful to political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other States'.\nBoth the technical and content regulation dimensions of the statist vision for Internet governance were embodied in a draft 'Code of Conduct' that China, Russia and other members of the SCO submitted to the UN General Assembly in 2011 and again in revised form in early 2015. As Eliza Watt notes, the Draft\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\n\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nCodes marked ‘a first step towards the development of a universal document under the auspices of the UN aimed at providing comprehensive information security’. The 2011 Draft Code endorsed ‘the establishment of a multilateral, transparent and democratic international management of the Internet to ensure an equitable distribution of resources, facilitate access for all and ensure a stable and secure functioning of the Internet’. On content regulation, the same text promoted ‘curbing the dissemination of information that incites terrorism, secessionism or extremism or that undermines other countries’ political, economic and social stability, as well as their spiritual and cultural environment’.\nUnsurprisingly, the United States strongly resisted the 2011 Draft Code for fear these proposals would ‘make it easier for governments to suppress free speech’ and ‘legitimize repressive state practices’. Although the 2015 Draft Code purported to reflect revisions ‘taking into full consideration the comments and suggestions from all parties’, its vision and approach remained largely the same. Neither version of the Draft Codes managed to garner sufficient support amongst other States in the international community.\nRussian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, U.N.Doc.

At the WCIT, Russia sought to ensure ITU control over the Internet’s name and numbering system by proposing ITR revisions which provided that ‘Member States shall have equal rights to manage the Internet, including in regard to the allotment, assignment and reclamation of Internet numbering, naming, addressing and identification resources and to support for the operation and development of basic Internet infrastructure’. The United States and European Union Member States resisted and ensured the provision’s removal, alongside a disclaimer in ITR Article 1.1(a) that confirmed the ITRs ‘do not address the content-related aspects of telecommunications’.\nRussia nonetheless managed to secure the inclusion of a separate resolution attached to the treaty text, recognising that ‘all governments should have an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance and for ensuring the stability, security and continuity of the existing Internet and its future development and of the future internet’. This led dozens of States to remain silent on the ITRs by declining to sign and/or ratify them, even as ultimately, a majority of 89 out of 144 ITU Member States adopted the new regulations. The United States explicitly tied its inaction to, inter alia, the ‘provisions on internet governance’. The head of the US delegation, Terry Kramer, expressed concern that the revised text might be used by authoritarian\n See Eichensehr, supra note 35, at 329-335.\n Proposals Received from ITU Member States for the Work of the Conference, Document DT/1-E, World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT-12), Dubai, Dec. 2-14, 2012 (Nov. 20, 2012), Art. 3A, Add.

Through a multi-year process ending in 2016, the United States relinquished its contractual control over ICANN. In its place, ICANN’s stakeholders adopted a revamped, global, multi-stakeholder model of governance (albeit one still incorporated under California law).56\nThe Internet governance context offers four lessons for how we think about State silence generally and reactive State silence in particular. For starters, it contextualizes why there has been so little discussion of reactive State silence and international law in the cyber domain, namely, the absence of international legal mechanisms for governance generally. The emergence of the ICANN multistakeholder regulatory model led to situations where the effects of reactive State silence to both its establishment and attempts to supplant it were so self-evident as to not merit comment. Here, State silence in reaction to ICANN’s emergence inevitably amounted to acceptance (albeit not of the formation or evolution of international law per se), tolerating regulation outside national and multilateral legal structures. At the same time, State silence in reaction to the Draft Codes and the revised ITRs inescapably constituted lack of acceptance or opposition to attempts to supplant the extant multistakeholder model with specific forms of international legal governance.\nSecond, the Internet governance context suggests a need to broaden the backdrop against which international lawyers evaluate State silence. Most existing scholarship has considered ‘reactive’ silence in endogenous terms, examining how State silence impacts obligations or institutions in existing and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nacknowledged international legal regimes. The story of Internet governance highlights an exogenous ‘catalysing’ form of State silence. Instead of impacting international law’s contents, here State silence catalyses the contraction of its contours, fostering or supporting other regulatory models, whether the original U.S. national legal authorities or the current multistakeholder framework.\nMoreover, State silences in response to the Draft Codes also arguably had a catalysing effect. In particular, State silences on Internet governance frameworks both reflected—and to some extent created—space for other regulatory models to take hold, including: (i) private forms of governance (for example, content moderation rules and practices developed by social media companies like Facebook), (ii) non-binding voluntary norms (for example, the Christchurch Call), (iii) regional human rights law (for example, those focused on the permissibility of different models of intermediary liability frameworks), (iv) negotiations for regional regulations (for example, the European Union’s Digital Services Act package and General Data Protection Regulation), and (v) domestic law (for example, intermediary liability laws and constitutional law). The result is today’s regime complex of online content governance that reflects a plurality of regulatory approaches.\nThird, we should be careful to acknowledge that the plurality of regulatory approaches to Internet governance has involved the selective, rather than absolute, absence of international law. For example, while opposing ITU involvement in Internet governance, the United States supported application of World Intellectual Property Organization treaties to the Internet and the adoption of World Trade Organization decisions implicating the cyber domain.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIndeed, through these international legal regimes the United States – together with US technology giants such as Google and Facebook – consolidated a neoliberal model of Internet governance, one with greater emphasis on intellectual property protection, the ‘free flow of information doctrine’, and the collection and monetization of personal data for profit, rather than, for example, data protection and privacy. Similarly, the demise of the Draft Codes did not mean a law-free zone for Internet governance given extant international law regimes empowering State efforts to regulate speech domestically (e.g., prescriptive jurisdiction) or to cabin when and how they may do so (e.g., international human rights provisions on freedom of expression).\nFinally, divisions amongst States highlight the importance of the political context to the interplay among speech acts and silence. In Internet governance, reactive State silence played a stabilizing role that reinforced particular power dynamics. The United States, its allies, and its ‘Big Tech’ companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) flourished under the extant multistakeholder model and preferred its evolution over any ITU substitution. In contrast, States that spoke out were the disrupters, seeking to supplant the ICANN model in favour of a statist vision of Internet governance. In this dynamic, the act of refusing to break silence (e.g., by ratifying a new treaty or endorsing an ITU role) was not only an act of power, but signalled a priority to one collective grouping of States and stakeholders over another.\n## II. State Silence and State-Sponsored Cyber-operations\nAs States gained interest in the architecture by which the Internet operates, they also become interested in how they might employ it for political, military, and intelligence purposes. ICTs offered States a way to operate quickly and (relatively) cheaply on a global scale. They could do so, moreover, both secretly and covertly – the technology affords anonymity to most actors who want it with technical attribution of responsibility to a particular computer system difficult, to say nothing of ascribing responsibility to a human operator or those who direct them. States have taken advantage of these features to conduct various offensive ‘cyber-operations’, including: (i) cyber-attacks that disrupt or disable the availability or integrity of computer systems, networks, or the infrastructure they\n Zalnieriute, supra note 63, at 63-65; see also Henning Lahmann, On the Politics and Ideologies of the Sovereignty Discourse in Cyberspace, 32 DUKE J.

Many of these operations involve 'proxies', further complicating efforts to delimit online activity under the direction or control of a State.\nThe secret and covert nature of State and State-sponsored cyber-operations complicates any assessment of associated silences. Importantly, neither secrecy nor covertness are uniform concepts. It is important, for example, to differentiate deep and shallow secret cyber-operations. Deep secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence is not yet publicly known. Shallow secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence becomes publicly known – for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or other actors' detection – but whose content remains obscured. In addition, a distinction may be drawn between non-covert, covert, and quasi-covert cyber-operations. Non-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State officially acknowledged by the acting State. Covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are officially unacknowledged by the acting State. Quasi-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are either acknowledged in part, acknowledged at some point after taking place, or reported and hypothetically justified without official acknowledgements by the acting State.\nCyber-operations are, by design, almost always meant to occur unobserved, and, if observed, be unattributable to, or at least unacknowledged\n See, e.g., Herbert Lin &amp; Jackie Kerr, On Cyber-Enabled Information/Influence Warfare and Manipulation, in P. CORNISH (Ed.), THE OXFORD HANDBOOK ON CYBERSECURITY (OUP 2022); Herbert S. Lin, Offensive Cyber-operations and the Use of Force, 4 J. NAT'L SECURITY L. &amp; POL'Y 63 (2010). In addition, States engage in a range of 'defensive' behaviours on-line some of which, like the US 'defend forward' policy may be perceived by their targets as offensive in character.

Deep secret cyber-operations thus raise a cyber version of the proverbial question of whether a tree that falls in the forest makes a sound when there is no one there to hear it? If a cyber-operation never comes to light, we might characterize the silence that accompanies it as non-reactive – to use the language of the ILC, it is difficult to see how a State could be characterised as being ‘in a position to react’ to a cyber-operation where the State lacks ‘knowledge’ of it.71 Still, there are intermediate postures between entirely unknown cyber behaviours and public and acknowledged acts where a potential for reactions (and thus, reactive silences) arise. A State may be able to observe (or believe it knows of) another State’s covert cyber-operation and decline to respond.\nAt the same time, surveying State silences in response to hostile cyber-operations that have become publicly known to date, we see value in expanding the scope of State reactions beyond such cases of complete silence (where a State offers no responsive speech, behaviour, or engagement). Secret and covert cyber-operations have highlighted the potential for what we call partial silence—explicit State speech, behaviour, or engagements in response to a cyber-operation, which is silent either with respect to international law in general or as to the specific norms of international law implicated.72\nAn example of complete silence is Iran’s initial response to the Stuxnet cyber-operation. When its centrifuges began spinning out of control in 2008, Iran had no reaction, apparently on the assumption that the failure stemmed from internal operating problems rather than external causes.73 It took years for Iran to break its complete silence by characterising the incident as a ‘massive cyber-attack’ and accusing the US and Israel of deploying the malicious computer worm, albeit without any suggestion that it was an internationally wrongful act.74\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn recent years, such a partial silence in response to hostile cyber-operations has become increasingly common.75 Sometimes, States have responded by publicly attributing cyber-operations to other States without condemnation. For example, the only US public response to the 2014-2015 massive data theft from the Office of Personnel Management was admiration – James Clapper, then-head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, remarked that ‘you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did’.76\nOther times, States have condemned the behaviour of other States whilst remaining silent as to the incident’s characterisation under international law. US Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, suggested that the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated North Korea’s ‘flagrant disregard for international norms’,77 while US President Obama similarly avoided international law language in characterising Russia’s cyber information operation on the 2016 US presidential election as a ‘violation of established norms of behaviour’.78 These partial silences persist even where condemnations take a coordinated form. For instance, in response to the 2017 spread of WannaCry malware (which disrupted the functioning of hundreds of thousands of computers across over 150 States), the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing the cyber-attack to North Korea and condemning its behaviour without mentioning international law at all.79\nthat Iran had detected a planned “massive cyber-attack” against its nuclear facilities, blaming the United States, Israel and Britain’).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn one exceptional case, States did publicly combine an attribution of hostile cyber-operations to another State with claims they were violative of international law (whilst remaining silent as to which specific rules of international law were violated). In October 2018, the UK and its allies exposed and condemned a series of cyber-operations conducted by the Russian military intelligence service against political institutions, businesses, media outlets, and an international sports agency. The UK Foreign Secretary suggested that ‘this pattern of behaviour demonstrates [Russia’s] desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences’. The Netherlands suggested these activities ‘undermine the international rule of law’, while Canada’s statement made clear that Russia’s malicious cyber activities ‘demonstrate a disregard for international law and undermine the rules-based international order’. None of these accusations delineated whether all of the GRU’s alleged operations violated international law or if only some did; nor did they elaborate which international laws were violated.\nIn short, both victim and third States are almost always completely or partially silent in response to hostile cyber-operations. As Efrony and Shany note, there is currently ‘so little in the practice of victim States to indicate that [their international legal rights] actually guide their conduct when confronted by cyber-operations’. For our purposes, it is just as important to note the pervasive\nLongergan, What Makes This Attribution of Chinese Hacking Different, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT (July 22, 2021).\nSee UK National Cyber Security Centre, Reckless campaign of cyber-attacks by Russian military intelligence service exposed, PRESS RELEASE (Oct. 4, 2018) ('flagrant violation of international law'); see also Council of the EU, Joint statement by Presidents Tusk and Juncker and High Representative Mogherini on Russian cyber-attacks, PRESS RELEASE (Oct. 4, 2018) ('We deplore such actions, which undermine international law and international institutions'); Prime Minister of Australia, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, Media Release: Attribution of a Pattern of Malicious Cyber Activity to Russia (Oct. 4, 2018) ('contrary to the consensus on international law and norms'); see also Jeffrey Biller and Michael Schmitt, Un-caging the Bear?

Why have States been so reticent to invoke the vocabulary of international law or assess any legal salience in their silences?\nOne possibility may be that victim States assume the secret and/or covert nature of hostile cyber-operations negates their characterisation as a practice that calls for a reaction. While the development of international law generally occurs through the practice of a few ‘movers and shakers’ in combination with the reactive silence of a larger number of passive States, not all reactive State silences are legally salient. Here, it may be significant that there has generally been silence accompanying the hostile cyber-operations themselves, whether in their secrecy (which ‘may obscure the practice itself, or any related, internally held opinio juris’) or their covertness, (where even if the acts become a shallow secret—publicly known, for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or detection by other actors—acting States uniformly decline to acknowledge their authorship).\nIt is commonly asserted that State acts must be public to qualify as state practice. According to the International Law Association’s (ILA) Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, for example, ‘a secret physical act [...] is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tried to assert that its conduct was legally justified’. This suggests that a State conducting cyber-operations that remain deep secrets or, if discovered, remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by the State alleged to have conducted it), will ‘cede its voice and weight of its practice in the development of the law’.

And if there’s no legally relevant practice, there is nothing to which the victim State must respond (whether via acquiescence or in opposition). Under this approach, reactive silences would only have legal effects if the accused State itself attempted to acknowledge its behaviour (a move that has yet to occur in cyberspace as States rarely, if ever, explicitly acknowledge specific cyber-operations as their own).\nWhatever the strength of such logic, the fact that States have yet to express it leaves open the possibility that other actors may assign legal salience to their reactive silences, even those that are partial in nature. The ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification, for example, suggest that for practice to contribute to the formation and identification of customary international law, it is sufficient for it to ‘be known to other States (whether or not it is publicly available)’, adding that ‘it is difficult to see how confidential conduct by a State could serve such a purpose unless and until it is known to other States’. Similarly, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law claims that ‘in order to count, practice has to be public or communicated to some extent’, a requirement that can be fulfilled once the practice is ‘communicated to one other State or relevant international organization including the ICRC’, even communications made to the ICRC in confidence. On this view, for secret and/or covert cyber-operations to constitute conditions calling for a reaction it may suffice for them to ‘be known to other States’, even if they remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by States alleged to have conducted them).\nFrom this perspective, there follows the possibility of investing legal salience in a State’s reactive silence to at least some types of secret or covert cyber-operations. For instance, a complete reactive silence to a shallow secret operation could be deemed acceptance based on the ILC’s endorsement of the idea that practices may be deemed evidence of opinio juris where it represents\n BUCHAN, supra note 91, at 154, 164.

Whether or not States currently condemn hostile cyber accusations in explicitly legal terms, can signalling disapproval of such acts (as US President Biden did recently with respect to Chinese cyber-espionage) counter-act claims the accused State’s operations are (or are becoming) permitted by international law—in other words, counter-act any notion that such practices are being tolerated?\nAlternatively, individual reactive partial silences might accumulate in scale over time to generate what is deemed to be a de facto collective acceptance of the practice of various cyber-operations. In other words, if States’ usage over time continuously denounces cyber-operations as unwanted but not internationally unlawful, might States at some point infer international law does not prohibit such acts—or at the least, transform a ‘real rule’ of international law into a ‘paper rule’. Under this reasoning, partial silences would be read literally, suggesting the underlying behaviour is, as the colloquial saying goes, ‘awful but lawful’. According to Perina, for example, ‘[s]hallowly secret covert activity that is tolerated by the international community encourages in both the covert actors and third States the practice of covert behavior, as it confirms that the political costs of covertness are low’.\nSuch a view aligns with those who view espionage as either a lawful exception to otherwise unlawful acts or outside international law’s purview entirely (especially where victim States consistently object to espionage on political grounds or claim violations of national laws without international legal objections). The US Department of Defense General Counsel’s 2020 statement suggests such reasoning, rejecting the idea that sovereignty always functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace given so many States’ complete or partially silent reactions to countless cases of publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks. This view might, of course, be characterized as giving international law a permissive content as to State sponsored cyber-operations.\n See supra note 10 and accompanying text.\n See White House Press Release, supra note 79.\n Perina, supra note 15, at 576 (citing Michael J Glennon, How International Rules Die, 93 GEORGETOWN L. J. 939, 953, 956 (2005).\n Perina, supra note 15, at 579; see also ARONSSON-STORRIER, supra note 69, at 137-141 (critiquing the notion that publicly known, but unacknowledged, acts to which states remain silent should be considered legally salient).\n See Ney, supra note 14 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nBut like espionage, it may also represent a catalysing silence, shifting the conduct beyond international law’s purview.\nAbsent rhetoric (let alone doctrine) on reactive silences in cyberspace, it is difficult to know what legal meaning – none, opposition, acceptance – to assign to complete or partially silent reactions to State cyber-operations. Such ambiguity counsels States to clarify how their silences should be understood in different circumstances to mitigate the possibility of other actors misconstruing and assigning meaning to them. In doing so, however, we must recognize the challenge of agency. Assigning any legal salience to silence, whether as acceptance or not, risks marginalizing those States prone to silence, not because of any legal position, but because they may lack the time, knowledge, or capabilities to determine how best to legally characterise hostile cyber-operations, to say nothing of State interests in avoiding engagements that may trigger involvements with opposing hegemonic actors.\n## III. State Silences and State Statements on the Application of International Law to Cyber-operations\nSo far, we have assumed at least some international legal regulation of State-sponsored cyber-operations. But that has not always been a safe assumption. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, even as States became more interested (and capable) in conducting cyber-operations, they remained silent on the relevant international legal frameworks governing that behaviour. The effect of such\n The same outcome may follow the first option proposed above, denying any legal salience to secret or covert cyber-operations. See supra notes 86-92, and accompanying text. Interestingly, therefore, partial silences are only non-catalysing where their legal content is inferred despite its explicit absence.

In 2018, however, Russia proposed States negotiate a treaty to regulate information weapons; the idea received a cool reception from Western states worried that doing so would green-light constraints on privacy and freedom of expression. See Letter dated September 23, 1998 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations concerning Agenda Item 63, U.N. Doc. A/C.1/53/3 (1998). Since then, the Council of Europe concluded a treaty on cyber-crime and discussions are ongoing at the UN for a global cybercrime convention. But aside from these examples (and an African Union treaty that has yet to enter into force), international law offers few cyber-specific conventional regulations.

Did ICT's novelties suggest States should regard cyber-operations, like Internet governance, as largely outside international law's purview, as a case of non liquet, or subject to pre-existing general public international law rules and principles in the absence of overt objections to doing so? As the first edition of the Tallinn Manual summarized it:\nThe threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how. Views on the subject range from a full application of the law of armed conflict, along the lines of the International Court of Justice's pronouncement that it applies to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' to strict application of the Permanent Court of International Justice's pronouncement that acts not forbidden in international law are generally permitted.\nIn 2013, a consensus report by a UN Group of Governmental Experts ('UN GGE') affirmed international law's general applicability. Since then, that position has been reiterated by the UN General Assembly and various regional international organizations.\nThe resolution of existential questions about international law's application overall, however, merely opened the door to debates over which international laws applied. For example, several states, but principally China, resisted accepting any application of international humanitarian law to online behaviours, arguing that doing so would accelerate the Internet's\nfor Negotiating Cybercrime Treaty amid Concerns over 'Rushed' Vote at Expense of Further Consultations, UN Doc. 12328 (May 26, 2021).\n See Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Sousa Dias, Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond, EJILTALK!

Other existing international law doctrines and mechanisms (e.g., due diligence, countermeasures) encountered similar challenges.\nIn 2012, the United States began to elaborate its official views on how international law applies to cyberspace via a series of public statements.

Over 25 States have now offered national views on international law’s application to cyberspace and a UN Open Ended Working Group ('OEWG') has called for all States to do so.\nFor all the attention such statements garnered, much less has been devoted to the reactive silence they received.

How should international law assess these silences? For those who insist that generally applicable international law rules already bind States in cyberspace, it might follow that these statements have no salience. Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita Dias, for example, emphasize that\nInternational legal rules or principles of general applicability, i.e., applicable under general international law to all types of state activity in the relevant circumstances, such as the prohibition on the use of force, non-intervention, the Corfu Channel rule of 'due diligence', international human rights law and international humanitarian law, thus, do not need further proof of applicability to ICTs or other new technologies via specific state practice and opinio juris 'in cyberspace'. Their scope is sufficiently broad to be interpreted and applied to ICTs. It is the burden of those advocating for ICTs' exclusion from their scope to present evidence that states, in their general practice accepted as law, have actively carved out ICTs.\nTaking this view one step further, it might be possible to reason that State statements about international law applications are not a constitutive element of customary international law online; and if that is the case, reactive silence to such statements similarly lacks legal salience.\nFor some, however, cyberspace's novelties require States to elaborate new state practice and opinio juris before ascribing legal obligations to States. Consider the views of Israel's Deputy Attorney General:\nIt cannot be automatically presumed that a customary rule applicable in any of the physical domains is also applicable to the cyber domain. The key question in identifying State practice is whether the practice which arose in other domains is closely related to the activity envisaged in the cyber domain. Additionally, it must be ascertained that the opinio juris which gave rise to the customary rules applicable in other domains was not domain-specific. Given the unique characteristics of the cyber domain, such an analysis is to be made with particular prudence, as it is very often the case that relevant differences exist.\nFor supporters of the domain-specific approach, State statements have value as opinio juris, begging the question if they therefore qualify as circumstances calling for a reaction?\n States have, however, been more vocal in accepting international institutional views on the applicability of international law. See, e.g., Italy, Position Paper on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), ¶3 (concurring with UN GGE and OEWG conclusions on international law's applicability to cyberspace).\n Akande et al., supra note 104.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nWhere State statements have legal salience, their context could signal the audience's acceptance of what the statements say. For some, this conclusion may follow from the technology itself; unlike earlier eras, State views can now be easily expressed, distributed, and aggregated for purposes of assessing *opinio juris*. Such capacities may favour considering official State statements as a circumstance calling for a reaction. Alternatively, the case for acceptance finds support among ‘specially affected’ States who themselves have the capacity to engage in the same cyber-operations subject to these statements. As Kevin Heller explains, even if silence as consent is controversial, ‘there seems to be widespread acceptance of the idea that specially-affected states, unlike states that are not specially affected, have an obligation to object to a claim concerning the customary status of a practice—and that their silence should be considered support if they do not’.\nThere are, however, countervailing possibilities. States may remain silent to avoid giving the statement the further credibility a response might imply. Or, they may remain silent to avoid the geopolitical fray that aligning with one set of state views or another would entail. Some States also clearly have capacity constraints, both in understanding how cyber-operations work and around the relevant international legal issues they raise. Assigning these silences legal salience risks overburdening States by suggesting they must monitor for, and respond to, the views of all the 190+ nation states whenever they choose to\n For an example of this in practice, see Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, et al., *Mapping States’ Reactions to the U.S. Strikes Against Syria of April 2018–A Comprehensive Guide*, JUST SECURITY (May 7, 2018).\n Evolutions in machine learning are likely to only enhance such capabilities.

Some Member States indicated a reluctance to make similar signals lest they embroil that State in the competition and conflict among these actors; issues States can avoid by staying silent’).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nspeak. Limiting response obligations to specially affected States (assuming that category can even be identified and the relevant states so designated) could mitigate such concerns, but the secret and covert nature of cyber capacities suggests States may resist conceding capacities for fear it might remove some of their advantages. Big data and machine learning may someday lessen these constraints and equalize state capacities, but those days have yet to arrive. Today, drawing inferences from State silence more likely implicates the agency issues raised above; requiring States to speak out (whether to endorse or oppose other States' statements) involves a political act that would mostly just affirm the power of the States speaking.\nWhatever the legal salience of the ‘reactive’ silence States have offered other States’ statements, it would be a mistake to ignore the silence evident in the more than 150 States who have yet to affirmatively offer their own views on how international law applies in cyberspace. Even if not reactive, such silences appear catalysing. They create space for non-State actors to fill the silence with their own views. The two *Tallinn Manuals* and the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross serve as the most prominent examples. As ‘first movers’, the positions expressed in these efforts have remained influential even among States that decide to break their silence. Thus, even though Germany declined to endorse the second *Tallinn Manual* in its entirety, its own later statement repeatedly and expressly concurs with its views. Nor is silence’s catalysing effect limited to academic experts. In the landmark surveillance case, *Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v. the UK*, the European Court of Human Rights was able to assess the compliance of the UK’s extraterritorial surveillance regime with the European Convention on Human Rights on ‘the assumption’ that the matters\n On challenges of human and financial resources of Third World states with respect to customary international law, see B.S.

Non-state actors may also take the lead in pushing for state action; witness, Microsoft President Brad Smith calling on states in 2017 to adopt a ‘Digital Geneva Convention’. See Brad Smith, *The Need for a Digital Geneva Convention*, RSA Conference (Feb. 14, 2017).\n See 2021 GGE Report, *supra* note 112, Annex, at 33, 35.

Stymied over how to articulate international law applications in cyberspace, a 2015 UN GGE identified eleven non-binding ‘voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour’. These norms purport to establish shared expectations of appropriate future behaviour in cyberspace that do not depend on law to establish their logic of appropriateness. The precise relationship between these norm promotion efforts and international law is unclear. The 2021 OEWG report clarified these ‘norms do not replace or alter States’ obligations or rights under international law, which are binding, but rather provide additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs’, whilst also noting these ‘[n]orms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law’. The fact remains, however, that subsequent state endorsements of these norms are often partially silent – they do not address whether and which voluntary norms codify pre-existing international legal rules and standards.\nIV. Conclusion\nAt first glance, the cyber context has little to contribute to a volume on reactive State silence. Except for one passing comment by a Trump Administration official, there is no relevant international legal discourse on ‘circumstances that call for a reaction’ in cyberspace. States have yet to talk about silence’s salience and there are no court opinions (international or domestic) that raise the topic. Thus, we do not know whether, when, or how reactive silence constructs\n Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v.

As such, we lack requisite evidence to address many of this volume's research questions. We do not know if the work of non-State actors (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals) or institutional fora (e.g., UN GGE reports) call for a reaction by States, nor whether a legal (viz. a political) claim is necessary to do so. Without recognition of the existence of reactive silences, let alone their thresholds, we have little to say about questions of consistency for purposes of law-production or if the technologies that ICTs represent can impact findings of acquiescence or non-acceptance.\nOn closer examination, however, cyberspace may inform our understanding of State silences in at least three ways. First and foremost, it highlights the importance of distinguishing international legal rhetoric about silence from the fact of its existence. Even if States and other stakeholders have yet to acknowledge it explicitly, our case studies of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law reveal an array of contexts where States have reacted with silence to the claims or conduct of others. Identifying these instances of silence opens the door to the very sorts of interpretations and interactions that have evolved reactive silence in other legal fields. We thus see our chapter as a modest, opening move – an invitation to others to identify and examine incidents of reactive silence in cyberspace and to assess whether they have legal salience, and, if so, whether, when and how they might constitute acceptance, non-acceptance, or opposition.\nSecond, the very inattention reactive silence has received in addressing international law and cyberspace warrants attention. It may, of course, be simply a feature of the field's immaturity that will gradually resolve over time. On the other hand, there may be certain contextual conditions in cyberspace whose existence obstructs any role for reactive silence. Hence, in opening the door to discuss State silences in cyberspace, we also invite consideration of whether and which conditions explain the current silence on State silence.\nConsider, for example, questions of clarity about the existence and meaning of international law itself. Might legal salience for reactive silence require some baseline consensus about what international laws exist or mean in the cyber context before we can assume anything about ensuing silences? Similarly, our discussion of secret and/or covert cyber-operations suggests that reactive silence may depend on some measure of transparency – acknowledged or at least known conduct to which others may react. Does the fact that the underlying behaviour is itself conducted in silence restrict international law's ability to assign value to any reactions, including silence? But even if we could make State behaviours in cyberspace more transparent, questions remain about each State's capacity to\n See Ch. 1, at xx-xx.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nunderstand the technology, how it works, and what it means for international law generally, let alone reactive silences in particular? At present, cyberspace is rife with capacity questions as the vast majority of States lack sufficient understanding of ICTs as a technical matter, leaving them behind or outside the conduct and conversations of more tech-savvy actors. Assigning silences legal salience in such contexts may not only be difficult but normatively questionable if it enables a form of legal imperialism by those with the most capability to act at the expense of most States who are targeted and/or victimized by other States' behaviour online. The ICT context also suggests that the status quo's susceptibility to change may impact recognition of reactive silences. Given the Internet's dynamic nature, with ICTs constantly evolving (and with them the means and methods by which States operate), it may be difficult to ascribe legal value to responses, silent or otherwise, especially, if at the time, the underlying claims or conduct quickly become outdated or obsolete.\nMore research is needed to assess if clarity, transparency, capability, and/or susceptibility help explain the current silence about State silence in cyberspace. In doing so, we would also invite assessments of whether these conditions may have explanatory value for the state of reactive silence in other areas of international law. Our list is not, however, in any way exhaustive – we would expect that in cyberspace as in other contexts, additional conditions may impact or control reactive silence's contours and contents.\nThird, whatever roles reactive silence occupies in cyberspace, our treatments of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law suggest the utility of additional perspectives on silences. Our treatment has highlighted two – (i) partial silences where silence is broken in reaction to some conduct or claims but silence about international law itself remains; and (ii) catalysing silences where the absence of claims or conduct involving international law trigger or otherwise facilitate non-international legal institutions (e.g., multistakeholder governance models like ICANN) or norms (e.g., the UN GGE's 11 voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour). State silence may also facilitate non-State actor voices within international law (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals).\nAt present, moreover, we believe both partial and catalysing silences have a much larger impact on the construction of international law in cyberspace than reactive silence. As such, we would call for more attention to these silences across international law more generally to see what impacts, if any, they have had on the law's formation, operation, or efficacy.\nState silence may have been a feature of the early Internet, impacting its evolution and, in turn, the availability of international law and international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ninstitutions. Today, in contrast, States are speaking about—and acting in—cyberspace with ever-greater attention and intensity. Rather than diminishing the importance of State silence, however, these voices (and their identities) demand more attention to the legal salience and implications of the silence that remains. Thus, the time is ripe for States to begin to talk about their silence in cyberspace. States and scholars now need to understand when silence can reinforce, rather than undermine, the regulation of the Internet as an open, stable, and secure space for human flourishing and peaceful coexistence among States.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718"

Various ways exist to describe these layers. The bottom 'link' layer includes the physical hardware/media used to access the Internet. The next three layers involve coding – 'network' and 'transport' layers break data into packets and route them between networks. An 'applications' layer converts the routed data into useful things like files, videos, and web sites. On top of these coded layers, a final 'content' layer comprises all information shared across ICTs. Each layer functions independently; at the application layer, for example, Google Chrome works regardless of whether the link layer employs DSL or 5G.

Much of this behaviour has implications for the international legal order as States now regularly participate in the governance of cyberspace (i.e., regulating the Internet's technical architecture) and governance in cyberspace (i.e., delineating what behaviours to prohibit, permit, or require). As States speak out more, however, it begs a question: what are the implications of international law for the State silence that remains?\nThe particular conception of State silence that forms the focus of this volume is 'reactive State silence' – the absence of physical or verbal acts of a State against the background of someone else's conduct or claim.5 As this volume's introductory chapter notes, reactive State silence may be legally significant in at least three ways: acceptance, iterating the formation or evolution of international law via concepts like acquiescence;6 lack of acceptance, for example indicating that there is no international agreement;7 or opposition, in the sense of resisting the formation or evolution of international law, for example abstaining from ratifying a treaty or voting in the United Nations General Assembly as evidence of a State's resistance to the formation of a customary rule.8\nThe International Law Commission (ILC)'s work on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice suggests silence may constitute 'acceptance ... when the circumstances call for some reaction'.9 Conclusion 10(3) of the ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification elaborates that '[f]ailure to react over time to a practice may serve as evidence of acceptance as law (opinio juris), provided that States were in a position to react and the circumstances called for some reaction'.10 The accompanying ILC commentary delimits circumstances calling for a reaction 'where the practice is one that affects – usually unfavourably – the interests or rights of the State failing or refusing to act'.11 According to the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nILC being ‘in a position to react’ means that ‘the State concerned must have had knowledge of the practice (which includes circumstances where, because of the publicity given to the practice, it must be assumed that the State had such knowledge)’ and that ‘it must have had sufficient time and ability to act’.¹² As such, the ILC concludes that ‘[w]here a State did not or could not have been expected to know of a certain practice, or has not yet had a reasonable time to respond, inaction cannot be attributed to an acknowledgement that such practice was mandated (or permitted) under customary international law’.¹³ The present volume centres on surfacing how States and other actors across different fields of international law understand and apply these abstract and context-independent thresholds.\nIn the cyber domain, however, the concept of reactive silence has been itself met with silence. States, courts, and other actors have had virtually (in both senses of the term) nothing to say about these thresholds specifically, or the potential legal salience of reactive State silence generally. The principal exception to this trend is a 2020 statement by the US Department of Defense General Counsel reflecting on whether sovereignty functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace; he suggested that ‘many States’ public silence in the face of countless publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks precludes a conclusion that States have coalesced around a common view that there is an international prohibition against all such operations ...’.¹⁴ Aside from this (brief) remark, we see little mention of any types of circumstances that call for another State’s reaction in the cyber domain, the meaning of a State’s capacity to react in this context, the threshold of knowledge of another State’s practice, or what amounts to a reasonable passage of time to respond.\nAgainst this background, our chapter offers an inaugural assessment of how reactive silence implicates international law-making in cyberspace. We do so through both descriptive and normative lenses. First, as a descriptive matter, we differentiate the absence of reactive silence rhetoric in international law from its factual existence in various contexts. We introduce three cases – (i) Internet governance, (ii) secret/covert State sponsored cyber-operations; and (iii) unilateral statements by States about international law in cyberspace – where we can identify reactive State silences and offer tentative thoughts on their legal\n¹² Id.

Doing so, in turn, provides a foundation for analysing why States and other stakeholders have yet to recognize reactive silence issues in cyber contexts.\nSecond, extant ambiguity about reactive State silence in cyberspace provides grounds for a normative claim: beyond reactive silences, international law would benefit from acknowledging other manifestations of State silence – which we label catalysing and partial silences – to assess international law and cyberspace. Catalysing silence involves the absence of verbal and/or physical acts of States – whether reactive or not – that empower alternative regulatory forms (e.g., voluntary non-binding norms) or authorities (e.g., non-State actor voices about international law). Partial silence involves instances where there is some verbal/physical State response to a claim or conduct (thereby disqualifying it as a ‘reactive silence’) but that reaction remains silent on all relevant international law implications. Like reactive silence, partial silence raises questions of legal salience in terms of acceptance, non-acceptance, and opposition. Thus, we aim to launch a conversation about the capacities and constraints of reactive silence to construct international law in cyberspace while offering additional frames for assessing State silence’s salience to international law overall.\nOur chapter proceeds in four parts. We begin with State silence’s role in the Internet governance context, where it generally catalysed ‘multistakeholder’ governance, with its reactive forms exhibiting acceptance by certain States of that model and opposition to other States’ attempts to supplant it with more conventional (i.e., multilateral) international legal frameworks. (I) Next, we turn to State silence vis-a-vis the rising number of State-sponsored cyber-operations, whose secret and/or covert nature may explain both their popularity and why States are reluctant to catalog them as State practices that constitute circumstances calling for a reaction under international law. (II) In this context, we explore whether partial silences in response to such operations have their own legal salience in terms of avoiding the international environment’s ‘default permissive condition’.¹⁵ We then turn to a new trend where certain States have begun to offer unilateral statements on how international law applies to cyberspace, asking if a State’s reactive silence to such statements (or the failure to publicize its own views) have legal salience to international-law making and who authors it. (III)\nThese case studies lead us to conclude that, although the cyber context may have little to say about reactive State silence and international law at present, the inattention to this topic itself suggests conditions that may implicate whether and when reactive silences garner legal salience: (i) clarity about the relevant legal\n¹⁵ Alexandra Perina, *Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law*, 53 COLUMB.

TRANSNAT’L L. 507, 576 (2015).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nrules; (ii) transparency about relevant State behaviour; (iii) capability in terms of understanding the underlying claims or conduct; and (iv) susceptibility for circumstances to change rapidly. (IV) Given cyberspace’s status quo, we close with a call for more States to break their silence not only on how international law applies to the cyber domain, but also how to construe any remaining State silences that follow.\n## I. State Silence and Internet Governance\nInternet governance encompasses ‘the design and administration of the technologies necessary to keep the Internet operational and the enactment of substantive policy around these technologies’.¹⁶ It is not ‘a monolithic system’ but ‘a multi-layered system of administration and operational oversight that spans areas as diverse as standards-setting, cybersecurity, and inter-connection arrangements’.¹⁷ At first, most States greeted this topic with silence. Whether out of ignorance or disinterest, most States did not engage with, or even speak about, the Internet’s governing institutions, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which was founded in 1986 and is comprised to this day by technical experts.¹⁸\nIn contrast to most States, the United States was never completely silent about Internet governance. In 1998, building off its early funding, the U.S. Department of Commerce solicited proposals for an institution to regulate the Internet’s naming and numbering system.¹⁹ The winning candidate was a non-profit entity based in Los Angeles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), that proposed to operate the system via ‘multi-stakeholder governance’ where individuals, non-commercial stakeholder groups, industry, and governments would offer inputs on a community-based, consensus\n¹⁶ LAURA DENARDIS, THE GLOBAL WAR FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE (Yale University Press 2014), at 6.\n¹⁷ Id., at 226.\n¹⁸ The IETF is responsible for designating technical standards and protocols by which the Internet operates. IETF, Missions and Principles, at https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/.\n¹⁹ Common, shared standards and protocols are necessary for connections to occur among today’s billions of digital devices and thousands of networks. For example, the servers used to send and receive things like e-mail each have an Internet protocol (IP) address while each e-mail address has a ‘domain’ name including top-level domains like .com or .edu and then second-level domains; hence, each university has a second-level domain under the top-level .edu domain (e.g., temple.edu). For this system to work, there must be a coordinated effort to distribute and track IP addresses, assign domain names, and oversee protocol parameter identifiers that are used by Internet standards.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ndriven approach.²⁰ ICANN’s emergence is significant for reflecting on State silence in the cyber domain because, as Milton Mueller explains, ‘ICANN’s original institutional design marked a revolutionary departure from traditional approaches to global governance’ providing ‘one of the few globally centralized points of control over the Internet’.²¹ Its mode of governance may be understood as a form of privatization which ‘significantly reduced the power of national governments and existing intergovernmental organizations over communication and information policy’.²² According to the The Economist, for example, ICANN amounted to a ‘completely new institutional animal [...] a hybrid between an online community and a real-world governance structure, an untested combination [...]: an industry trying to regulate part of itself, across the globe, with little or no input from national governments’.²³ At the same time, as Goldsmith and Wu explain, ICANN remained legally under contract to the US Department of Commerce, which had delegated the day-to-day management of Internet naming and numbering decisions to the organisation.²⁴ Thus, ‘ICANN’s spirit of ‘self-regulation’ was an appealing label for a process that could be more accurately described as the U.S. government brokering a behind-the-scenes deal that best suited its policy preferences [...] to ensure the stability of the Internet, to fend off the regulatory efforts of foreign governments and international organisations, and to maintain ultimate control’.²⁵\nICANN’s establishment can best be characterized as producing reactive silence among States. To be clear, States were not completely silent; in word and deed, they accepted – some more reluctantly than others²⁶ – ICANN’s authority to govern the Internet’s naming and numbering function pursuant to U.S. domestic law (in addition to its Department of Commerce contract, ICANN was\n20 Memorandum of Understanding Between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Sept. 30, 2000), at https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/1998/memorandum-understanding-between-us-department-commerce-and-internet-corporation-assigned-.\n21 MILTON L.

Yet, when it came to rhetoric about international law or engagement with international legal institutions, many States remained silent. Although neither States nor commentators have reflected on the precise meaning of this reactive silence, in practice it inescapably amounted to State toleration of an approach to Internet governance that did not directly involve international law.\nStates' initial toleration of ICANN was periodically subject to disruption as 'sovereigns outside the United States perceived it as a threat to their authority'. Three such efforts – and the reactive silence they generated – warrant attention here. An initial disruption period occurred during the UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) – a multilateral series of diplomatic conferences between 2002 and 2005 that sought to address a diversity of issues related to the information society, but which ultimately morphed into a 'battle over the soul of the Internet'. According to Mueller, WSIS witnessed 'a collision between those who saw national governments as the proper agents for defining and implementing international communication and information policy, and those who pursued a more open, pluralistic, and transnational policy-making framework'. For example, China, with the support of a number of Global South countries, proposed to establish an international Internet organisation and adoption of an Internet treaty. Then, before WSIS's second phase in 2005, the United States back-tracked on promises it had made in 1998 to relinquish authority over ICANN (and the 'root' server that executed its naming and numbering functions) in 2006. The European Union responded by proposing that the governance over the domain name system be shifted from ICANN to a UN-affiliated intergovernmental group. Neither the Chinese nor EU proposals succeeded, but they resulted in a compromise where the US and ICANN retained authority over domain names and numbers, but a new Internet Governance Forum was established where States could offer and discuss recommendations concerning Internet policy.\nThe past decade witnessed a second disruptive period as other States and stakeholders revived complaints about U.S. final authority over ICANN and its\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nmultistakeholder approach to Internet governance. The differences had deep conceptual underpinnings over whether cyberspace is a 'space' warranting autonomous regulation or a 'technology' that can be regulated by sovereign nations or the international organizations they create.³⁴ Supporting the latter frame, States like China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) sought to legitimize a broad statist approach to Internet governance with both technical and content governance dimensions.³⁵ In terms of technical regulation, these States called for a multilateral organization – the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) – to displace the multistakeholder model of governance embodied by ICANN. In terms of content regulation, under the banner of 'information security' these States sought to legitimize their efforts to monitor and suppress online forms of expression they viewed as a security threat, including expressions of internal dissent and anti-government content.³⁶ For example, in 2009 the SCO adopted an agreement that defined 'information war' in broad terms as 'dissemination of information harmful to political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other States'.³⁷\nBoth the technical and content regulation dimensions of the statist vision for Internet governance were embodied in a draft 'Code of Conduct' that China, Russia and other members of the SCO submitted to the UN General Assembly in 2011³⁸ and again in revised form in early 2015.³⁹ As Eliza Watt notes, the Draft\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\n34 Scholars have long engaged in similar debates.

Through a multi-year process ending in 2016, the United States relinquished its contractual control over ICANN. In its place, ICANN’s stakeholders adopted a revamped, global, multi-stakeholder model of governance (albeit one still incorporated under California law).56\nThe Internet governance context offers four lessons for how we think about State silence generally and reactive State silence in particular. For starters, it contextualizes why there has been so little discussion of reactive State silence and international law in the cyber domain, namely, the absence of international legal mechanisms for governance generally. The emergence of the ICANN multistakeholder regulatory model led to situations where the effects of reactive State silence to both its establishment and attempts to supplant it were so self-evident as to not merit comment. Here, State silence in reaction to ICANN’s emergence inevitably amounted to acceptance (albeit not of the formation or evolution of international law per se), tolerating regulation outside national and multilateral legal structures. At the same time, State silence in reaction to the Draft Codes and the revised ITRs inescapably constituted lack of acceptance or opposition to attempts to supplant the extant multistakeholder model with specific forms of international legal governance.\nSecond, the Internet governance context suggests a need to broaden the backdrop against which international lawyers evaluate State silence. Most existing scholarship has considered ‘reactive’ silence in endogenous terms, examining how State silence impacts obligations or institutions in existing and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nacknowledged international legal regimes. The story of Internet governance highlights an exogenous ‘catalysing’ form of State silence. Instead of impacting international law’s contents, here State silence catalyses the contraction of its contours, fostering or supporting other regulatory models, whether the original U.S. national legal authorities or the current multistakeholder framework.\nMoreover, State silences in response to the Draft Codes also arguably had a catalysing effect. In particular, State silences on Internet governance frameworks both reflected—and to some extent created—space for other regulatory models to take hold, including: (i) private forms of governance (for example, content moderation rules and practices developed by social media companies like Facebook⁵⁷), (ii) non-binding voluntary norms (for example, the Christchurch Call⁵⁸), (iii) regional human rights law (for example, those focused on the permissibility of different models of intermediary liability frameworks⁵⁹), (iv) negotiations for regional regulations (for example, the European Union’s Digital Services Act package and General Data Protection Regulation⁶⁰), and (v) domestic law (for example, intermediary liability laws and constitutional law⁶¹). The result is today’s regime complex of online content governance that reflects a plurality of regulatory approaches.⁶²\nThird, we should be careful to acknowledge that the plurality of regulatory approaches to Internet governance has involved the selective, rather than absolute, absence of international law. For example, while opposing ITU involvement in Internet governance, the United States supported application of World Intellectual Property Organization treaties to the Internet and the adoption of World Trade Organization decisions implicating the cyber domain.⁶³\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIndeed, through these international legal regimes the United States – together with US technology giants such as Google and Facebook – consolidated a neoliberal model of Internet governance, one with greater emphasis on intellectual property protection, the ‘free flow of information doctrine’, and the collection and monetization of personal data for profit, rather than, for example, data protection and privacy.⁶⁴ Similarly, the demise of the Draft Codes did not mean a law-free zone for Internet governance given extant international law regimes empowering State efforts to regulate speech domestically (e.g., prescriptive jurisdiction) or to cabin when and how they may do so (e.g., international human rights provisions on freedom of expression).⁶⁵\nFinally, divisions amongst States highlight the importance of the political context to the interplay among speech acts and silence. In Internet governance, reactive State silence played a stabilizing role that reinforced particular power dynamics. The United States, its allies, and its ‘Big Tech’ companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) flourished under the extant multistakeholder model and preferred its evolution over any ITU substitution. In contrast, States that spoke out were the disrupters, seeking to supplant the ICANN model in favour of a statist vision of Internet governance. In this dynamic, the act of refusing to break silence (e.g., by ratifying a new treaty or endorsing an ITU role) was not only an act of power, but signalled a priority to one collective grouping of States and stakeholders over another.\n## II. State Silence and State-Sponsored Cyber-operations\nAs States gained interest in the architecture by which the Internet operates, they also become interested in how they might employ it for political, military, and intelligence purposes. ICTs offered States a way to operate quickly and (relatively) cheaply on a global scale. They could do so, moreover, both secretly and covertly – the technology affords anonymity to most actors who want it with technical attribution of responsibility to a particular computer system difficult, to say nothing of ascribing responsibility to a human operator or those who direct them. States have taken advantage of these features to conduct various offensive ‘cyber-operations’, including: (i) cyber-attacks that disrupt or disable the availability or integrity of computer systems, networks, or the infrastructure they\n⁶⁴ Zalnieriute, supra note 63, at 63-65; see also Henning Lahmann, On the Politics and Ideologies of the Sovereignty Discourse in Cyberspace, 32 DUKE J.

Importantly, neither secrecy nor covertness are uniform concepts. It is important, for example, to differentiate deep and shallow secret cyber-operations.⁶⁸ Deep secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence is not yet publicly known. Shallow secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence becomes publicly known – for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or other actors' detection – but whose content remains obscured.⁶⁹ In addition, a distinction may be drawn between non-covert, covert, and quasi-covert cyber-operations.⁷⁰ Non-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State officially acknowledged by the acting State. Covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are officially unacknowledged by the acting State. Quasi-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are either acknowledged in part, acknowledged at some point after taking place, or reported and hypothetically justified without official acknowledgements by the acting State.\nCyber-operations are, by design, almost always meant to occur unobserved, and, if observed, be unattributable to, or at least unacknowledged\n⁶⁶ See, e.g., Herbert Lin &amp; Jackie Kerr, On Cyber-Enabled Information/Influence Warfare and Manipulation, in P.

Deep secret cyber-operations thus raise a cyber version of the proverbial question of whether a tree that falls in the forest makes a sound when there is no one there to hear it? If a cyber-operation never comes to light, we might characterize the silence that accompanies it as non-reactive – to use the language of the ILC, it is difficult to see how a State could be characterised as being ‘in a position to react’ to a cyber-operation where the State lacks ‘knowledge’ of it.71 Still, there are intermediate postures between entirely unknown cyber behaviours and public and acknowledged acts where a potential for reactions (and thus, reactive silences) arise. A State may be able to observe (or believe it knows of) another State’s covert cyber-operation and decline to respond.\nAt the same time, surveying State silences in response to hostile cyber-operations that have become publicly known to date, we see value in expanding the scope of State reactions beyond such cases of complete silence (where a State offers no responsive speech, behaviour, or engagement). Secret and covert cyber-operations have highlighted the potential for what we call partial silence—explicit State speech, behaviour, or engagements in response to a cyber-operation, which is silent either with respect to international law in general or as to the specific norms of international law implicated.72\nAn example of complete silence is Iran’s initial response to the Stuxnet cyber-operation. When its centrifuges began spinning out of control in 2008, Iran had no reaction, apparently on the assumption that the failure stemmed from internal operating problems rather than external causes.73 It took years for Iran to break its complete silence by characterising the incident as a ‘massive cyber-attack’ and accusing the US and Israel of deploying the malicious computer worm, albeit without any suggestion that it was an internationally wrongful act.74\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn recent years, such a partial silence in response to hostile cyber-operations has become increasingly common.75 Sometimes, States have responded by publicly attributing cyber-operations to other States without condemnation. For example, the only US public response to the 2014-2015 massive data theft from the Office of Personnel Management was admiration – James Clapper, then-head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, remarked that ‘you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did’.76\nOther times, States have condemned the behaviour of other States whilst remaining silent as to the incident’s characterisation under international law. US Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, suggested that the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated North Korea’s ‘flagrant disregard for international norms’,77 while US President Obama similarly avoided international law language in characterising Russia’s cyber information operation on the 2016 US presidential election as a ‘violation of established norms of behaviour’.78 These partial silences persist even where condemnations take a coordinated form. For instance, in response to the 2017 spread of WannaCry malware (which disrupted the functioning of hundreds of thousands of computers across over 150 States), the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing the cyber-attack to North Korea and condemning its behaviour without mentioning international law at all.79\nthat Iran had detected a planned “massive cyber-attack” against its nuclear facilities, blaming the United States, Israel and Britain’).\n75 See Martha Finnemore and Duncan B.

In October 2018, the UK and its allies exposed and condemned a series of cyber-operations conducted by the Russian military intelligence service against political institutions, businesses, media outlets, and an international sports agency.⁸⁰ The UK Foreign Secretary suggested that ‘this pattern of behaviour demonstrates [Russia’s] desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences’.⁸¹ The Netherlands suggested these activities ‘undermine the international rule of law’,⁸² while Canada’s statement made clear that Russia’s malicious cyber activities ‘demonstrate a disregard for international law and undermine the rules-based international order’.⁸³ None of these accusations delineated whether all of the GRU’s alleged operations violated international law or if only some did; nor did they elaborate which international laws were violated.⁸⁴\nIn short, both victim and third States are almost always completely or partially silent in response to hostile cyber-operations.

Why have States been so reticent to invoke the vocabulary of international law or assess any legal salience in their silences?\nOne possibility may be that victim States assume the secret and/or covert nature of hostile cyber-operations negates their characterisation as a practice that calls for a reaction. While the development of international law generally occurs through the practice of a few ‘movers and shakers’ in combination with the reactive silence of a larger number of passive States,⁸⁶ not all reactive State silences are legally salient.⁸⁷ Here, it may be significant that there has generally been silence accompanying the hostile cyber-operations themselves, whether in their secrecy (which ‘may obscure the practice itself, or any related, internally held opinio juris’) or their covertness, (where even if the acts become a shallow secret—publicly known, for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or detection by other actors—acting States uniformly decline to acknowledge their authorship).⁸⁸\nIt is commonly asserted that State acts must be public to qualify as state practice.⁸⁹ According to the International Law Association’s (ILA) Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, for example, ‘a secret physical act [...] is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tried to assert that its conduct was legally justified’.⁹⁰ This suggests that a State conducting cyber-operations that remain deep secrets or, if discovered, remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by the State alleged to have conducted it), will ‘cede its voice and weight of its practice in the development of the law’.⁹¹ In other\n⁸⁶ M.

And if there’s no legally relevant practice, there is nothing to which the victim State must respond (whether via acquiescence or in opposition). Under this approach, reactive silences would only have legal effects if the accused State itself attempted to acknowledge its behaviour (a move that has yet to occur in cyberspace as States rarely, if ever, explicitly acknowledge specific cyber-operations as their own).⁹²\nWhatever the strength of such logic, the fact that States have yet to express it leaves open the possibility that other actors may assign legal salience to their reactive silences, even those that are partial in nature. The ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification, for example, suggest that for practice to contribute to the formation and identification of customary international law, it is sufficient for it to ‘be known to other States (whether or not it is publicly available)’, adding that ‘it is difficult to see how confidential conduct by a State could serve such a purpose unless and until it is known to other States’.⁹³ Similarly, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law claims that ‘in order to count, practice has to be public or communicated to some extent’, a requirement that can be fulfilled once the practice is ‘communicated to one other State or relevant international organization including the ICRC’, even communications made to the ICRC in confidence.⁹⁴ On this view, for secret and/or covert cyber-operations to constitute conditions calling for a reaction it may suffice for them to ‘be known to other States’, even if they remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by States alleged to have conducted them).⁹⁵\nFrom this perspective, there follows the possibility of investing legal salience in a State’s reactive silence to at least some types of secret or covert cyber-operations. For instance, a complete reactive silence to a shallow secret operation could be deemed acceptance based on the ILC’s endorsement of the idea that practices may be deemed evidence of opinio juris where it represents\n⁹² BUCHAN, supra note 91, at 154, 164.

Whether or not States currently condemn hostile cyber accusations in explicitly legal terms, can signalling disapproval of such acts (as US President Biden did recently with respect to Chinese cyber-espionage⁹⁷) counter-act claims the accused State’s operations are (or are becoming) permitted by international law—in other words, counter-act any notion that such practices are being tolerated?\nAlternatively, individual reactive partial silences might accumulate in scale over time to generate what is deemed to be a de facto collective acceptance of the practice of various cyber-operations. In other words, if States’ usage over time continuously denounces cyber-operations as unwanted but not internationally unlawful, might States at some point infer international law does not prohibit such acts—or at the least, transform a ‘real rule’ of international law into a ‘paper rule’.⁹⁸ Under this reasoning, partial silences would be read literally, suggesting the underlying behaviour is, as the colloquial saying goes, ‘awful but lawful’. According to Perina, for example, ‘[s]hallowly secret covert activity that is tolerated by the international community encourages in both the covert actors and third States the practice of covert behavior, as it confirms that the political costs of covertness are low’.⁹⁹\nSuch a view aligns with those who view espionage as either a lawful exception to otherwise unlawful acts or outside international law’s purview entirely (especially where victim States consistently object to espionage on political grounds or claim violations of national laws without international legal objections). The US Department of Defense General Counsel’s 2020 statement suggests such reasoning, rejecting the idea that sovereignty always functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace given so many States’ complete or partially silent reactions to countless cases of publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks.¹⁰⁰ This view might, of course, be characterized as giving international law a permissive content as to State sponsored cyber-operations.\n⁹⁶ See supra note 10 and accompanying text.\n⁹⁷ See White House Press Release, supra note 79.\n⁹⁸ Perina, supra note 15, at 576 (citing Michael J Glennon, How International Rules Die, 93 GEORGETOWN L. J. 939, 953, 956 (2005).\n⁹⁹ Perina, supra note 15, at 579; see also ARONSSON-STORRIER, supra note 69, at 137-141 (critiquing the notion that publicly known, but unacknowledged, acts to which states remain silent should be considered legally salient).\n¹⁰⁰ See Ney, supra note 14 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nBut like espionage, it may also represent a catalysing silence, shifting the conduct beyond international law’s purview.¹⁰¹\nAbsent rhetoric (let alone doctrine) on reactive silences in cyberspace, it is difficult to know what legal meaning – none, opposition, acceptance – to assign to complete or partially silent reactions to State cyber-operations. Such ambiguity counsels States to clarify how their silences should be understood in different circumstances to mitigate the possibility of other actors misconstruing and assigning meaning to them. In doing so, however, we must recognize the challenge of agency. Assigning any legal salience to silence, whether as acceptance or not, risks marginalizing those States prone to silence, not because of any legal position, but because they may lack the time, knowledge, or capabilities to determine how best to legally characterise hostile cyber-operations, to say nothing of State interests in avoiding engagements that may trigger involvements with opposing hegemonic actors.¹⁰²\n## III. State Silences and State Statements on the Application of International Law to Cyber-operations\nSo far, we have assumed at least some international legal regulation of State-sponsored cyber-operations. But that has not always been a safe assumption. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, even as States became more interested (and capable) in conducting cyber-operations, they remained silent on the relevant international legal frameworks governing that behaviour.¹⁰³ The effect of such\n¹⁰¹ The same outcome may follow the first option proposed above, denying any legal salience to secret or covert cyber-operations. See supra notes 86-92, and accompanying text. Interestingly, therefore, partial silences are only non-catalysing where their legal content is inferred despite its explicit absence. See supra notes 93-97 and accompanying text.\n¹⁰² Elisabeth Schweiger, Targeted Killing and the Lack of Acquiescence, 32 LEIDEN J.

In 2018, however, Russia proposed States negotiate a treaty to regulate information weapons; the idea received a cool reception from Western states worried that doing so would green-light constraints on privacy and freedom of expression. See Letter dated September 23, 1998 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations concerning Agenda Item 63, U.N. Doc. A/C.1/53/3 (1998). Since then, the Council of Europe concluded a treaty on cyber-crime and discussions are ongoing at the UN for a global cybercrime convention. But aside from these examples (and an African Union treaty that has yet to enter into force), international law offers few cyber-specific conventional regulations. See, e.g., Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, Nov. 23, 2001) CETS No 185; UNGA Press Release, General Assembly Adopts Resolution Outlining Terms\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nsilence was, however, far from clear. Did ICT's novelties suggest States should regard cyber-operations, like Internet governance, as largely outside international law's purview, as a case of non liquet, or subject to pre-existing general public international law rules and principles in the absence of overt objections to doing so?¹⁰⁴ As the first edition of the Tallinn Manual summarized it:\nThe threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how. Views on the subject range from a full application of the law of armed conflict, along the lines of the International Court of Justice's pronouncement that it applies to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' to strict application of the Permanent Court of International Justice's pronouncement that acts not forbidden in international law are generally permitted.¹⁰⁵\nIn 2013, a consensus report by a UN Group of Governmental Experts ('UN GGE') affirmed international law's general applicability.¹⁰⁶ Since then, that position has been reiterated by the UN General Assembly and various regional international organizations.¹⁰⁷\nThe resolution of existential questions about international law's application overall, however, merely opened the door to debates over which international laws applied. For example, several states, but principally China, resisted accepting any application of international humanitarian law to online behaviours, arguing that doing so would accelerate the Internet's\nfor Negotiating Cybercrime Treaty amid Concerns over 'Rushed' Vote at Expense of Further Consultations, UN Doc. 12328 (May 26, 2021).\n¹⁰⁴ See Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Sousa Dias, Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond, EJILTALK!

For those who insist that generally applicable international law rules already bind States in cyberspace, it might follow that these statements have no salience. Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita Dias, for example, emphasize that\nInternational legal rules or principles of general applicability, i.e., applicable under general international law to all types of state activity in the relevant circumstances, such as the prohibition on the use of force, non-intervention, the Corfu Channel rule of 'due diligence', international human rights law and international humanitarian law, thus, do not need further proof of applicability to ICTs or other new technologies via specific state practice and opinio juris 'in cyberspace'. Their scope is sufficiently broad to be interpreted and applied to ICTs. It is the burden of those advocating for ICTs' exclusion from their scope to present evidence that states, in their general practice accepted as law, have actively carved out ICTs.¹⁴\nTaking this view one step further, it might be possible to reason that State statements about international law applications are not a constitutive element of customary international law online; and if that is the case, reactive silence to such statements similarly lacks legal salience.\nFor some, however, cyberspace's novelties require States to elaborate new state practice and opinio juris before ascribing legal obligations to States. Consider the views of Israel's Deputy Attorney General:\nIt cannot be automatically presumed that a customary rule applicable in any of the physical domains is also applicable to the cyber domain. The key question in identifying State practice is whether the practice which arose in other domains is closely related to the activity envisaged in the cyber domain. Additionally, it must be ascertained that the opinio juris which gave rise to the customary rules applicable in other domains was not domain-specific. Given the unique characteristics of the cyber domain, such an analysis is to be made with particular prudence, as it is very often the case that relevant differences exist.\nFor supporters of the domain-specific approach, State statements have value as opinio juris, begging the question if they therefore qualify as circumstances calling for a reaction?\n¹³ States have, however, been more vocal in accepting international institutional views on the applicability of international law. See, e.g., Italy, Position Paper on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), ¶3 (concurring with UN GGE and OEWG conclusions on international law's applicability to cyberspace).\n¹⁴ Akande et al., supra note 104.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nWhere State statements have legal salience, their context could signal the audience's acceptance of what the statements say. For some, this conclusion may follow from the technology itself; unlike earlier eras, State views can now be easily expressed, distributed, and aggregated for purposes of assessing *opinio juris*.¹¹⁵ Such capacities may favour considering official State statements as a circumstance calling for a reaction.¹¹⁶ Alternatively, the case for acceptance finds support among ‘specially affected’ States who themselves have the capacity to engage in the same cyber-operations subject to these statements. As Kevin Heller explains, even if silence as consent is controversial, ‘there seems to be widespread acceptance of the idea that specially-affected states, unlike states that are not specially affected, have an obligation to object to a claim concerning the customary status of a practice—and that their silence should be considered support if they do not’.¹¹⁷\nThere are, however, countervailing possibilities. States may remain silent to avoid giving the statement the further credibility a response might imply.¹¹⁸ Or, they may remain silent to avoid the geopolitical fray that aligning with one set of state views or another would entail.¹¹⁹ Some States also clearly have capacity constraints, both in understanding how cyber-operations work and around the relevant international legal issues they raise. Assigning these silences legal salience risks overburdening States by suggesting they must monitor for, and respond to, the views of all the 190+ nation states whenever they choose to\n¹¹⁵ For an example of this in practice, see Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, et al., *Mapping States’ Reactions to the U.S. Strikes Against Syria of April 2018–A Comprehensive Guide*, JUST SECURITY (May 7, 2018).\n¹¹⁶ Evolutions in machine learning are likely to only enhance such capabilities.

Some Member States indicated a reluctance to make similar signals lest they embroil that State in the competition and conflict among these actors; issues States can avoid by staying silent’).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nspeak.¹²⁰ Limiting response obligations to specially affected States (assuming that category can even be identified and the relevant states so designated) could mitigate such concerns, but the secret and covert nature of cyber capacities suggests States may resist conceding capacities for fear it might remove some of their advantages. Big data and machine learning may someday lessen these constraints and equalize state capacities, but those days have yet to arrive.¹²¹ Today, drawing inferences from State silence more likely implicates the agency issues raised above; requiring States to speak out (whether to endorse or oppose other States' statements) involves a political act that would mostly just affirm the power of the States speaking.\nWhatever the legal salience of the ‘reactive’ silence States have offered other States’ statements, it would be a mistake to ignore the silence evident in the more than 150 States who have yet to affirmatively offer their own views on how international law applies in cyberspace. Even if not reactive, such silences appear catalysing. They create space for non-State actors to fill the silence with their own views.¹²² The two *Tallinn Manuals* and the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross serve as the most prominent examples.¹²³ As ‘first movers’, the positions expressed in these efforts have remained influential even among States that decide to break their silence. Thus, even though Germany declined to endorse the second *Tallinn Manual* in its entirety, its own later statement repeatedly and expressly concurs with its views.¹²⁴ Nor is silence’s catalysing effect limited to academic experts. In the landmark surveillance case, *Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v. the UK*, the European Court of Human Rights was able to assess the compliance of the UK’s extraterritorial surveillance regime with the European Convention on Human Rights on ‘the assumption’ that the matters\n¹²⁰ On challenges of human and financial resources of Third World states with respect to customary international law, see B.S.

Stymied over how to articulate international law applications in cyberspace, a 2015 UN GGE identified eleven non-binding ‘voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour’.¹²⁶ These norms purport to establish shared expectations of appropriate future behaviour in cyberspace that do not depend on law to establish their logic of appropriateness.¹²⁷ The precise relationship between these norm promotion efforts and international law is unclear. The 2021 OEWG report clarified these ‘norms do not replace or alter States’ obligations or rights under international law, which are binding, but rather provide additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs’, whilst also noting these ‘[n]orms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law’.¹²⁸ The fact remains, however, that subsequent state endorsements of these norms are often partially silent – they do not address whether and which voluntary norms codify pre-existing international legal rules and standards.¹²⁹\nIV. Conclusion\nAt first glance, the cyber context has little to contribute to a volume on reactive State silence. Except for one passing comment by a Trump Administration official, there is no relevant international legal discourse on ‘circumstances that call for a reaction’ in cyberspace. States have yet to talk about silence’s salience and there are no court opinions (international or domestic) that raise the topic. Thus, we do not know whether, when, or how reactive silence constructs\n¹²⁵ Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v.

As such, we lack requisite evidence to address many of this volume's research questions.¹³⁰ We do not know if the work of non-State actors (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals) or institutional fora (e.g., UN GGE reports) call for a reaction by States, nor whether a legal (viz. a political) claim is necessary to do so. Without recognition of the existence of reactive silences, let alone their thresholds, we have little to say about questions of consistency for purposes of law-production or if the technologies that ICTs represent can impact findings of acquiescence or non-acceptance.\nOn closer examination, however, cyberspace may inform our understanding of State silences in at least three ways. First and foremost, it highlights the importance of distinguishing international legal rhetoric about silence from the fact of its existence. Even if States and other stakeholders have yet to acknowledge it explicitly, our case studies of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law reveal an array of contexts where States have reacted with silence to the claims or conduct of others. Identifying these instances of silence opens the door to the very sorts of interpretations and interactions that have evolved reactive silence in other legal fields. We thus see our chapter as a modest, opening move – an invitation to others to identify and examine incidents of reactive silence in cyberspace and to assess whether they have legal salience, and, if so, whether, when and how they might constitute acceptance, non-acceptance, or opposition.\nSecond, the very inattention reactive silence has received in addressing international law and cyberspace warrants attention. It may, of course, be simply a feature of the field's immaturity that will gradually resolve over time. On the other hand, there may be certain contextual conditions in cyberspace whose existence obstructs any role for reactive silence. Hence, in opening the door to discuss State silences in cyberspace, we also invite consideration of whether and which conditions explain the current silence on State silence.\nConsider, for example, questions of clarity about the existence and meaning of international law itself. Might legal salience for reactive silence require some baseline consensus about what international laws exist or mean in the cyber context before we can assume anything about ensuing silences? Similarly, our discussion of secret and/or covert cyber-operations suggests that reactive silence may depend on some measure of transparency – acknowledged or at least known conduct to which others may react. Does the fact that the underlying behaviour is itself conducted in silence restrict international law's ability to assign value to any reactions, including silence? But even if we could make State behaviours in cyberspace more transparent, questions remain about each State's capacity to\n¹³⁰ See Ch. 1, at xx-xx.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nunderstand the technology, how it works, and what it means for international law generally, let alone reactive silences in particular? At present, cyberspace is rife with capacity questions as the vast majority of States lack sufficient understanding of ICTs as a technical matter, leaving them behind or outside the conduct and conversations of more tech-savvy actors. Assigning silences legal salience in such contexts may not only be difficult but normatively questionable if it enables a form of legal imperialism by those with the most capability to act at the expense of most States who are targeted and/or victimized by other States' behaviour online. The ICT context also suggests that the status quo's susceptibility to change may impact recognition of reactive silences. Given the Internet's dynamic nature, with ICTs constantly evolving (and with them the means and methods by which States operate), it may be difficult to ascribe legal value to responses, silent or otherwise, especially, if at the time, the underlying claims or conduct quickly become outdated or obsolete.\nMore research is needed to assess if clarity, transparency, capability, and/or susceptibility help explain the current silence about State silence in cyberspace. In doing so, we would also invite assessments of whether these conditions may have explanatory value for the state of reactive silence in other areas of international law. Our list is not, however, in any way exhaustive – we would expect that in cyberspace as in other contexts, additional conditions may impact or control reactive silence's contours and contents.\nThird, whatever roles reactive silence occupies in cyberspace, our treatments of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law suggest the utility of additional perspectives on silences. Our treatment has highlighted two – (i) partial silences where silence is broken in reaction to some conduct or claims but silence about international law itself remains; and (ii) catalysing silences where the absence of claims or conduct involving international law trigger or otherwise facilitate non-international legal institutions (e.g., multistakeholder governance models like ICANN) or norms (e.g., the UN GGE's 11 voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour). State silence may also facilitate non-State actor voices within international law (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals).\nAt present, moreover, we believe both partial and catalysing silences have a much larger impact on the construction of international law in cyberspace than reactive silence. As such, we would call for more attention to these silences across international law more generally to see what impacts, if any, they have had on the law's formation, operation, or efficacy.\nState silence may have been a feature of the early Internet, impacting its evolution and, in turn, the availability of international law and international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718\nDRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ninstitutions. Today, in contrast, States are speaking about—and acting in—cyberspace with ever-greater attention and intensity. Rather than diminishing the importance of State silence, however, these voices (and their identities) demand more attention to the legal salience and implications of the silence that remains. Thus, the time is ripe for States to begin to talk about their silence in cyberspace. States and scholars now need to understand when silence can reinforce, rather than undermine, the regulation of the Internet as an open, stable, and secure space for human flourishing and peaceful coexistence among States.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718"

HOLLIS BARRIE SANDER Cyberspace¹ emerged amidst State silence.² Although one State—the United States—played a key role in funding the information and communication technologies (ICTs) that evolved into the modern Internet, it was largely developed by university academics and, later, commercial enterprises.³ There was little input from other States, who were unaware—or uninterested—in the nascent technology and its potential risks and rewards.⁴ Such silence stands in contrast to the prevalence of States' verbal and physical acts in and about cyberspace today. Cyberspace's rising priority along humanitarian, economic, political, and military lines has spawned an array of ¹ A socio-technical institution, cyberspace involves a multi-layered assemblage of hardware, software, and networks that store and exchange data, including chiefly the Internet. Various ways exist to describe these layers. The bottom 'link' layer includes the physical hardware/media used to access the Internet. The next three layers involve coding – 'network' and 'transport' layers break data into packets and route them between networks. An 'applications' layer converts the routed data into useful things like files, videos, and web sites. On top of these coded layers, a final 'content' layer comprises all information shared across ICTs. Each layer functions independently; at the application layer, for example, Google Chrome works regardless of whether the link layer employs DSL or 5G.

Much of this behaviour has implications for the international legal order as States now regularly participate in the governance of cyberspace (i.e., regulating the Internet's technical architecture) and governance in cyberspace (i.e., delineating what behaviours to prohibit, permit, or require). As States speak out more, however, it begs a question: what are the implications of international law for the State silence that remains?\nThe particular conception of State silence that forms the focus of this volume is 'reactive State silence' – the absence of physical or verbal acts of a State against the background of someone else's conduct or claim.5 As this volume's introductory chapter notes, reactive State silence may be legally significant in at least three ways: acceptance, iterating the formation or evolution of international law via concepts like acquiescence;6 lack of acceptance, for example indicating that there is no international agreement;7 or opposition, in the sense of resisting the formation or evolution of international law, for example abstaining from ratifying a treaty or voting in the United Nations General Assembly as evidence of a State's resistance to the formation of a customary rule.8 The International Law Commission (ILC)'s work on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice suggests silence may constitute 'acceptance... when the circumstances call for some reaction'.9 Conclusion 10(3) of the ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification elaborates that '[f]ailure to react over time to a practice may serve as evidence of acceptance as law (opinio juris), provided that States were in a position to react and the circumstances called for some reaction'.10 The accompanying ILC commentary delimits circumstances calling for a reaction 'where the practice is one that affects – usually unfavourably – the interests or rights of the State failing or refusing to act'.11 According to the Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nILC being ‘in a position to react’ means that ‘the State concerned must have had knowledge of the practice (which includes circumstances where, because of the publicity given to the practice, it must be assumed that the State had such knowledge)’ and that ‘it must have had sufficient time and ability to act’.¹² As such, the ILC concludes that ‘[w]here a State did not or could not have been expected to know of a certain practice, or has not yet had a reasonable time to respond, inaction cannot be attributed to an acknowledgement that such practice was mandated (or permitted) under customary international law’.¹³ The present volume centres on surfacing how States and other actors across different fields of international law understand and apply these abstract and context-independent thresholds.\nIn the cyber domain, however, the concept of reactive silence has been itself met with silence. States, courts, and other actors have had virtually (in both senses of the term) nothing to say about these thresholds specifically, or the potential legal salience of reactive State silence generally. The principal exception to this trend is a 2020 statement by the US Department of Defense General Counsel reflecting on whether sovereignty functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace; he suggested that ‘many States’ public silence in the face of countless publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks precludes a conclusion that States have coalesced around a common view that there is an international prohibition against all such operations...’.¹⁴ Aside from this (brief) remark, we see little mention of any types of circumstances that call for another State’s reaction in the cyber domain, the meaning of a State’s capacity to react in this context, the threshold of knowledge of another State’s practice, or what amounts to a reasonable passage of time to respond.\nAgainst this background, our chapter offers an inaugural assessment of how reactive silence implicates international law-making in cyberspace. We do so through both descriptive and normative lenses. First, as a descriptive matter, we differentiate the absence of reactive silence rhetoric in international law from its factual existence in various contexts. We introduce three cases – (i) Internet governance, (ii) secret/covert State sponsored cyber-operations; and (iii) unilateral statements by States about international law in cyberspace – where we can identify reactive State silences and offer tentative thoughts on their legal ¹² Id.

Doing so, in turn, provides a foundation for analysing why States and other stakeholders have yet to recognize reactive silence issues in cyber contexts.\nSecond, extant ambiguity about reactive State silence in cyberspace provides grounds for a normative claim: beyond reactive silences, international law would benefit from acknowledging other manifestations of State silence – which we label catalysing and partial silences – to assess international law and cyberspace. Catalysing silence involves the absence of verbal and/or physical acts of States – whether reactive or not – that empower alternative regulatory forms (e.g., voluntary non-binding norms) or authorities (e.g., non-State actor voices about international law). Partial silence involves instances where there is some verbal/physical State response to a claim or conduct (thereby disqualifying it as a ‘reactive silence’) but that reaction remains silent on all relevant international law implications. Like reactive silence, partial silence raises questions of legal salience in terms of acceptance, non-acceptance, and opposition. Thus, we aim to launch a conversation about the capacities and constraints of reactive silence to construct international law in cyberspace while offering additional frames for assessing State silence’s salience to international law overall.\nOur chapter proceeds in four parts. We begin with State silence’s role in the Internet governance context, where it generally catalysed ‘multistakeholder’ governance, with its reactive forms exhibiting acceptance by certain States of that model and opposition to other States’ attempts to supplant it with more conventional (i.e., multilateral) international legal frameworks. (I) Next, we turn to State silence vis-a-vis the rising number of State-sponsored cyber-operations, whose secret and/or covert nature may explain both their popularity and why States are reluctant to catalog them as State practices that constitute circumstances calling for a reaction under international law. (II) In this context, we explore whether partial silences in response to such operations have their own legal salience in terms of avoiding the international environment’s ‘default permissive condition’.¹⁵ We then turn to a new trend where certain States have begun to offer unilateral statements on how international law applies to cyberspace, asking if a State’s reactive silence to such statements (or the failure to publicize its own views) have legal salience to international-law making and who authors it. (III) These case studies lead us to conclude that, although the cyber context may have little to say about reactive State silence and international law at present, the inattention to this topic itself suggests conditions that may implicate whether and when reactive silences garner legal salience: (i) clarity about the relevant legal ¹⁵ Alexandra Perina, *Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law*, 53 COLUMB. J. TRANSNAT’L L. 507, 576 (2015).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nrules; (ii) transparency about relevant State behaviour; (iii) capability in terms of understanding the underlying claims or conduct; and (iv) susceptibility for circumstances to change rapidly. (IV) Given cyberspace’s status quo, we close with a call for more States to break their silence not only on how international law applies to the cyber domain, but also how to construe any remaining State silences that follow.\n## I. State Silence and Internet Governance Internet governance encompasses ‘the design and administration of the technologies necessary to keep the Internet operational and the enactment of substantive policy around these technologies’.¹⁶ It is not ‘a monolithic system’ but ‘a multi-layered system of administration and operational oversight that spans areas as diverse as standards-setting, cybersecurity, and inter-connection arrangements’.¹⁷ At first, most States greeted this topic with silence. Whether out of ignorance or disinterest, most States did not engage with, or even speak about, the Internet’s governing institutions, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which was founded in 1986 and is comprised to this day by technical experts.¹⁸ In contrast to most States, the United States was never completely silent about Internet governance. In 1998, building off its early funding, the U.S. Department of Commerce solicited proposals for an institution to regulate the Internet’s naming and numbering system.¹⁹ The winning candidate was a non-profit entity based in Los Angeles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), that proposed to operate the system via ‘multi-stakeholder governance’ where individuals, non-commercial stakeholder groups, industry, and governments would offer inputs on a community-based, consensus ¹⁶ LAURA DENARDIS, THE GLOBAL WAR FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE (Yale University Press 2014), at 6.\n¹⁷ Id., at 226.\n¹⁸ The IETF is responsible for designating technical standards and protocols by which the Internet operates. IETF, Missions and Principles, at https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/.\n¹⁹ Common, shared standards and protocols are necessary for connections to occur among today’s billions of digital devices and thousands of networks. For example, the servers used to send and receive things like e-mail each have an Internet protocol (IP) address while each e-mail address has a ‘domain’ name including top-level domains like.com or.edu and then second-level domains; hence, each university has a second-level domain under the top-level.edu domain (e.g., temple.edu). For this system to work, there must be a coordinated effort to distribute and track IP addresses, assign domain names, and oversee protocol parameter identifiers that are used by Internet standards.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ndriven approach.²⁰ ICANN’s emergence is significant for reflecting on State silence in the cyber domain because, as Milton Mueller explains, ‘ICANN’s original institutional design marked a revolutionary departure from traditional approaches to global governance’ providing ‘one of the few globally centralized points of control over the Internet’.²¹ Its mode of governance may be understood as a form of privatization which ‘significantly reduced the power of national governments and existing intergovernmental organizations over communication and information policy’.²² According to the The Economist, for example, ICANN amounted to a ‘completely new institutional animal [...] a hybrid between an online community and a real-world governance structure, an untested combination [...]: an industry trying to regulate part of itself, across the globe, with little or no input from national governments’.²³ At the same time, as Goldsmith and Wu explain, ICANN remained legally under contract to the US Department of Commerce, which had delegated the day-to-day management of Internet naming and numbering decisions to the organisation.²⁴ Thus, ‘ICANN’s spirit of ‘self-regulation’ was an appealing label for a process that could be more accurately described as the U.S. government brokering a behind-the-scenes deal that best suited its policy preferences [...] to ensure the stability of the Internet, to fend off the regulatory efforts of foreign governments and international organisations, and to maintain ultimate control’.²⁵ ICANN’s establishment can best be characterized as producing reactive silence among States. To be clear, States were not completely silent; in word and deed, they accepted – some more reluctantly than others²⁶ – ICANN’s authority to govern the Internet’s naming and numbering function pursuant to U.S. domestic law (in addition to its Department of Commerce contract, ICANN was Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nincorporated under California law). Yet, when it came to rhetoric about international law or engagement with international legal institutions, many States remained silent. Although neither States nor commentators have reflected on the precise meaning of this reactive silence, in practice it inescapably amounted to State toleration of an approach to Internet governance that did not directly involve international law.\nStates' initial toleration of ICANN was periodically subject to disruption as 'sovereigns outside the United States perceived it as a threat to their authority'.[27] Three such efforts – and the reactive silence they generated – warrant attention here. An initial disruption period occurred during the UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) – a multilateral series of diplomatic conferences between 2002 and 2005 that sought to address a diversity of issues related to the information society, but which ultimately morphed into a 'battle over the soul of the Internet'.[28] According to Mueller, WSIS witnessed 'a collision between those who saw national governments as the proper agents for defining and implementing international communication and information policy, and those who pursued a more open, pluralistic, and transnational policy-making framework'.[29] For example, China, with the support of a number of Global South countries, proposed to establish an international Internet organisation and adoption of an Internet treaty.[30] Then, before WSIS's second phase in 2005, the United States back-tracked on promises it had made in 1998 to relinquish authority over ICANN (and the 'root' server that executed its naming and numbering functions) in 2006.[31] The European Union responded by proposing that the governance over the domain name system be shifted from ICANN to a UN-affiliated intergovernmental group.[32] Neither the Chinese nor EU proposals succeeded, but they resulted in a compromise where the US and ICANN retained authority over domain names and numbers, but a new Internet Governance Forum was established where States could offer and discuss recommendations concerning Internet policy.[33] The past decade witnessed a second disruptive period as other States and stakeholders revived complaints about U.S. final authority over ICANN and its Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nmultistakeholder approach to Internet governance. The differences had deep conceptual underpinnings over whether cyberspace is a 'space' warranting autonomous regulation or a 'technology' that can be regulated by sovereign nations or the international organizations they create.³⁴ Supporting the latter frame, States like China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) sought to legitimize a broad statist approach to Internet governance with both technical and content governance dimensions.³⁵ In terms of technical regulation, these States called for a multilateral organization – the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) – to displace the multistakeholder model of governance embodied by ICANN. In terms of content regulation, under the banner of 'information security' these States sought to legitimize their efforts to monitor and suppress online forms of expression they viewed as a security threat, including expressions of internal dissent and anti-government content.³⁶ For example, in 2009 the SCO adopted an agreement that defined 'information war' in broad terms as 'dissemination of information harmful to political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other States'.³⁷ Both the technical and content regulation dimensions of the statist vision for Internet governance were embodied in a draft 'Code of Conduct' that China, Russia and other members of the SCO submitted to the UN General Assembly in 2011³⁸ and again in revised form in early 2015.³⁹ As Eliza Watt notes, the Draft Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nCodes marked ‘a first step towards the development of a universal document under the auspices of the UN aimed at providing comprehensive information security’.⁴⁰ The 2011 Draft Code endorsed ‘the establishment of a multilateral, transparent and democratic international management of the Internet to ensure an equitable distribution of resources, facilitate access for all and ensure a stable and secure functioning of the Internet’.⁴¹ On content regulation, the same text promoted ‘curbing the dissemination of information that incites terrorism, secessionism or extremism or that undermines other countries’ political, economic and social stability, as well as their spiritual and cultural environment’.⁴² Unsurprisingly, the United States strongly resisted the 2011 Draft Code for fear these proposals would ‘make it easier for governments to suppress free speech’ and ‘legitimize repressive state practices’.⁴³ Although the 2015 Draft Code purported to reflect revisions ‘taking into full consideration the comments and suggestions from all parties’,⁴⁴ its vision and approach remained largely the same.⁴⁵ Neither version of the Draft Codes managed to garner sufficient support amongst other States in the international community.⁴⁶ Russian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, U.N.Doc.

Through a multi-year process ending in 2016, the United States relinquished its contractual control over ICANN. In its place, ICANN’s stakeholders adopted a revamped, global, multi-stakeholder model of governance (albeit one still incorporated under California law).56 The Internet governance context offers four lessons for how we think about State silence generally and reactive State silence in particular. For starters, it contextualizes why there has been so little discussion of reactive State silence and international law in the cyber domain, namely, the absence of international legal mechanisms for governance generally. The emergence of the ICANN multistakeholder regulatory model led to situations where the effects of reactive State silence to both its establishment and attempts to supplant it were so self-evident as to not merit comment. Here, State silence in reaction to ICANN’s emergence inevitably amounted to acceptance (albeit not of the formation or evolution of international law per se), tolerating regulation outside national and multilateral legal structures. At the same time, State silence in reaction to the Draft Codes and the revised ITRs inescapably constituted lack of acceptance or opposition to attempts to supplant the extant multistakeholder model with specific forms of international legal governance.\nSecond, the Internet governance context suggests a need to broaden the backdrop against which international lawyers evaluate State silence. Most existing scholarship has considered ‘reactive’ silence in endogenous terms, examining how State silence impacts obligations or institutions in existing and Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nacknowledged international legal regimes. The story of Internet governance highlights an exogenous ‘catalysing’ form of State silence. Instead of impacting international law’s contents, here State silence catalyses the contraction of its contours, fostering or supporting other regulatory models, whether the original U.S. national legal authorities or the current multistakeholder framework.\nMoreover, State silences in response to the Draft Codes also arguably had a catalysing effect. In particular, State silences on Internet governance frameworks both reflected—and to some extent created—space for other regulatory models to take hold, including: (i) private forms of governance (for example, content moderation rules and practices developed by social media companies like Facebook⁵⁷), (ii) non-binding voluntary norms (for example, the Christchurch Call⁵⁸), (iii) regional human rights law (for example, those focused on the permissibility of different models of intermediary liability frameworks⁵⁹), (iv) negotiations for regional regulations (for example, the European Union’s Digital Services Act package and General Data Protection Regulation⁶⁰), and (v) domestic law (for example, intermediary liability laws and constitutional law⁶¹). The result is today’s regime complex of online content governance that reflects a plurality of regulatory approaches.⁶² Third, we should be careful to acknowledge that the plurality of regulatory approaches to Internet governance has involved the selective, rather than absolute, absence of international law. For example, while opposing ITU involvement in Internet governance, the United States supported application of World Intellectual Property Organization treaties to the Internet and the adoption of World Trade Organization decisions implicating the cyber domain.⁶³ Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIndeed, through these international legal regimes the United States – together with US technology giants such as Google and Facebook – consolidated a neoliberal model of Internet governance, one with greater emphasis on intellectual property protection, the ‘free flow of information doctrine’, and the collection and monetization of personal data for profit, rather than, for example, data protection and privacy.⁶⁴ Similarly, the demise of the Draft Codes did not mean a law-free zone for Internet governance given extant international law regimes empowering State efforts to regulate speech domestically (e.g., prescriptive jurisdiction) or to cabin when and how they may do so (e.g., international human rights provisions on freedom of expression).⁶⁵ Finally, divisions amongst States highlight the importance of the political context to the interplay among speech acts and silence. In Internet governance, reactive State silence played a stabilizing role that reinforced particular power dynamics. The United States, its allies, and its ‘Big Tech’ companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) flourished under the extant multistakeholder model and preferred its evolution over any ITU substitution. In contrast, States that spoke out were the disrupters, seeking to supplant the ICANN model in favour of a statist vision of Internet governance. In this dynamic, the act of refusing to break silence (e.g., by ratifying a new treaty or endorsing an ITU role) was not only an act of power, but signalled a priority to one collective grouping of States and stakeholders over another.\n## II. State Silence and State-Sponsored Cyber-operations As States gained interest in the architecture by which the Internet operates, they also become interested in how they might employ it for political, military, and intelligence purposes. ICTs offered States a way to operate quickly and (relatively) cheaply on a global scale. They could do so, moreover, both secretly and covertly – the technology affords anonymity to most actors who want it with technical attribution of responsibility to a particular computer system difficult, to say nothing of ascribing responsibility to a human operator or those who direct them. States have taken advantage of these features to conduct various offensive ‘cyber-operations’, including: (i) cyber-attacks that disrupt or disable the availability or integrity of computer systems, networks, or the infrastructure they ⁶⁴ Zalnieriute, supra note 63, at 63-65; see also Henning Lahmann, On the Politics and Ideologies of the Sovereignty Discourse in Cyberspace, 32 DUKE J.

Importantly, neither secrecy nor covertness are uniform concepts. It is important, for example, to differentiate deep and shallow secret cyber-operations.⁶⁸ Deep secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence is not yet publicly known. Shallow secret operations encompass acts attributable to a State whose existence becomes publicly known – for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or other actors' detection – but whose content remains obscured.⁶⁹ In addition, a distinction may be drawn between non-covert, covert, and quasi-covert cyber-operations.⁷⁰ Non-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State officially acknowledged by the acting State. Covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are officially unacknowledged by the acting State. Quasi-covert operations encompass acts attributable to a State that are either acknowledged in part, acknowledged at some point after taking place, or reported and hypothetically justified without official acknowledgements by the acting State.\nCyber-operations are, by design, almost always meant to occur unobserved, and, if observed, be unattributable to, or at least unacknowledged ⁶⁶ See, e.g., Herbert Lin &amp; Jackie Kerr, On Cyber-Enabled Information/Influence Warfare and Manipulation, in P. CORNISH (Ed.), THE OXFORD HANDBOOK ON CYBERSECURITY; Herbert S. Lin, Offensive Cyber-operations and the Use of Force, 4 J. NAT'L SECURITY L. &amp; POL'Y 63 (2010). In addition, States engage in a range of 'defensive' behaviours on-line some of which, like the US 'defend forward' policy may be perceived by their targets as offensive in character.

Deep secret cyber-operations thus raise a cyber version of the proverbial question of whether a tree that falls in the forest makes a sound when there is no one there to hear it? If a cyber-operation never comes to light, we might characterize the silence that accompanies it as non-reactive – to use the language of the ILC, it is difficult to see how a State could be characterised as being ‘in a position to react’ to a cyber-operation where the State lacks ‘knowledge’ of it.71 Still, there are intermediate postures between entirely unknown cyber behaviours and public and acknowledged acts where a potential for reactions (and thus, reactive silences) arise. A State may be able to observe (or believe it knows of) another State’s covert cyber-operation and decline to respond.\nAt the same time, surveying State silences in response to hostile cyber-operations that have become publicly known to date, we see value in expanding the scope of State reactions beyond such cases of complete silence (where a State offers no responsive speech, behaviour, or engagement). Secret and covert cyber-operations have highlighted the potential for what we call partial silence—explicit State speech, behaviour, or engagements in response to a cyber-operation, which is silent either with respect to international law in general or as to the specific norms of international law implicated.72 An example of complete silence is Iran’s initial response to the Stuxnet cyber-operation. When its centrifuges began spinning out of control in 2008, Iran had no reaction, apparently on the assumption that the failure stemmed from internal operating problems rather than external causes.73 It took years for Iran to break its complete silence by characterising the incident as a ‘massive cyber-attack’ and accusing the US and Israel of deploying the malicious computer worm, albeit without any suggestion that it was an internationally wrongful act.74 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn recent years, such a partial silence in response to hostile cyber-operations has become increasingly common.75 Sometimes, States have responded by publicly attributing cyber-operations to other States without condemnation. For example, the only US public response to the 2014-2015 massive data theft from the Office of Personnel Management was admiration – James Clapper, then-head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, remarked that ‘you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did’.76 Other times, States have condemned the behaviour of other States whilst remaining silent as to the incident’s characterisation under international law. US Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, suggested that the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrated North Korea’s ‘flagrant disregard for international norms’,77 while US President Obama similarly avoided international law language in characterising Russia’s cyber information operation on the 2016 US presidential election as a ‘violation of established norms of behaviour’.78 These partial silences persist even where condemnations take a coordinated form. For instance, in response to the 2017 spread of WannaCry malware (which disrupted the functioning of hundreds of thousands of computers across over 150 States), the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing the cyber-attack to North Korea and condemning its behaviour without mentioning international law at all.79 that Iran had detected a planned “massive cyber-attack” against its nuclear facilities, blaming the United States, Israel and Britain’).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nIn one exceptional case, States did publicly combine an attribution of hostile cyber-operations to another State with claims they were violative of international law (whilst remaining silent as to which specific rules of international law were violated). In October 2018, the UK and its allies exposed and condemned a series of cyber-operations conducted by the Russian military intelligence service against political institutions, businesses, media outlets, and an international sports agency.⁸⁰ The UK Foreign Secretary suggested that ‘this pattern of behaviour demonstrates [Russia’s] desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences’.⁸¹ The Netherlands suggested these activities ‘undermine the international rule of law’,⁸² while Canada’s statement made clear that Russia’s malicious cyber activities ‘demonstrate a disregard for international law and undermine the rules-based international order’.⁸³ None of these accusations delineated whether all of the GRU’s alleged operations violated international law or if only some did; nor did they elaborate which international laws were violated.⁸⁴ In short, both victim and third States are almost always completely or partially silent in response to hostile cyber-operations. As Efrony and Shany note, there is currently ‘so little in the practice of victim States to indicate that [their international legal rights] actually guide their conduct when confronted by cyber-operations’.⁸⁵ For our purposes, it is just as important to note the pervasive Longergan, What Makes This Attribution of Chinese Hacking Different, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT (July 22, 2021).\nSee UK National Cyber Security Centre, Reckless campaign of cyber-attacks by Russian military intelligence service exposed, PRESS RELEASE (Oct. 4, 2018) ('flagrant violation of international law'); see also Council of the EU, Joint statement by Presidents Tusk and Juncker and High Representative Mogherini on Russian cyber-attacks, PRESS RELEASE (Oct. 4, 2018) ('We deplore such actions, which undermine international law and international institutions'); Prime Minister of Australia, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, Media Release: Attribution of a Pattern of Malicious Cyber Activity to Russia (Oct. 4, 2018) ('contrary to the consensus on international law and norms'); see also Jeffrey Biller and Michael Schmitt, Un-caging the Bear?

Why have States been so reticent to invoke the vocabulary of international law or assess any legal salience in their silences?\nOne possibility may be that victim States assume the secret and/or covert nature of hostile cyber-operations negates their characterisation as a practice that calls for a reaction. While the development of international law generally occurs through the practice of a few ‘movers and shakers’ in combination with the reactive silence of a larger number of passive States,⁸⁶ not all reactive State silences are legally salient.⁸⁷ Here, it may be significant that there has generally been silence accompanying the hostile cyber-operations themselves, whether in their secrecy (which ‘may obscure the practice itself, or any related, internally held opinio juris’) or their covertness, (where even if the acts become a shallow secret—publicly known, for example, through leaks, partial disclosures, or detection by other actors—acting States uniformly decline to acknowledge their authorship).⁸⁸ It is commonly asserted that State acts must be public to qualify as state practice.⁸⁹ According to the International Law Association’s (ILA) Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, for example, ‘a secret physical act [...] is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tried to assert that its conduct was legally justified’.⁹⁰ This suggests that a State conducting cyber-operations that remain deep secrets or, if discovered, remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by the State alleged to have conducted it), will ‘cede its voice and weight of its practice in the development of the law’.⁹¹ In other ⁸⁶ M.

And if there’s no legally relevant practice, there is nothing to which the victim State must respond (whether via acquiescence or in opposition). Under this approach, reactive silences would only have legal effects if the accused State itself attempted to acknowledge its behaviour (a move that has yet to occur in cyberspace as States rarely, if ever, explicitly acknowledge specific cyber-operations as their own).⁹² Whatever the strength of such logic, the fact that States have yet to express it leaves open the possibility that other actors may assign legal salience to their reactive silences, even those that are partial in nature. The ILC Conclusions on Customary International Law Identification, for example, suggest that for practice to contribute to the formation and identification of customary international law, it is sufficient for it to ‘be known to other States (whether or not it is publicly available)’, adding that ‘it is difficult to see how confidential conduct by a State could serve such a purpose unless and until it is known to other States’.⁹³ Similarly, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law claims that ‘in order to count, practice has to be public or communicated to some extent’, a requirement that can be fulfilled once the practice is ‘communicated to one other State or relevant international organization including the ICRC’, even communications made to the ICRC in confidence.⁹⁴ On this view, for secret and/or covert cyber-operations to constitute conditions calling for a reaction it may suffice for them to ‘be known to other States’, even if they remain covert (i.e., unacknowledged by States alleged to have conducted them).⁹⁵ From this perspective, there follows the possibility of investing legal salience in a State’s reactive silence to at least some types of secret or covert cyber-operations. For instance, a complete reactive silence to a shallow secret operation could be deemed acceptance based on the ILC’s endorsement of the idea that practices may be deemed evidence of opinio juris where it represents ⁹² BUCHAN, supra note 91, at 154, 164. In a rare exception, the US did acknowledge its cyber espionage operations in the wake of the Snowden disclosures.

Whether or not States currently condemn hostile cyber accusations in explicitly legal terms, can signalling disapproval of such acts (as US President Biden did recently with respect to Chinese cyber-espionage⁹⁷) counter-act claims the accused State’s operations are (or are becoming) permitted by international law—in other words, counter-act any notion that such practices are being tolerated?\nAlternatively, individual reactive partial silences might accumulate in scale over time to generate what is deemed to be a de facto collective acceptance of the practice of various cyber-operations. In other words, if States’ usage over time continuously denounces cyber-operations as unwanted but not internationally unlawful, might States at some point infer international law does not prohibit such acts—or at the least, transform a ‘real rule’ of international law into a ‘paper rule’.⁹⁸ Under this reasoning, partial silences would be read literally, suggesting the underlying behaviour is, as the colloquial saying goes, ‘awful but lawful’. According to Perina, for example, ‘[s]hallowly secret covert activity that is tolerated by the international community encourages in both the covert actors and third States the practice of covert behavior, as it confirms that the political costs of covertness are low’.⁹⁹ Such a view aligns with those who view espionage as either a lawful exception to otherwise unlawful acts or outside international law’s purview entirely (especially where victim States consistently object to espionage on political grounds or claim violations of national laws without international legal objections). The US Department of Defense General Counsel’s 2020 statement suggests such reasoning, rejecting the idea that sovereignty always functions as a primary rule of international law in cyberspace given so many States’ complete or partially silent reactions to countless cases of publicly known cyber intrusions into foreign networks.¹⁰⁰ This view might, of course, be characterized as giving international law a permissive content as to State sponsored cyber-operations.\n⁹⁶ See supra note 10 and accompanying text.\n⁹⁷ See White House Press Release, supra note 79.\n⁹⁸ Perina, supra note 15, at 576 (citing Michael J Glennon, How International Rules Die, 93 GEORGETOWN L.

Such ambiguity counsels States to clarify how their silences should be understood in different circumstances to mitigate the possibility of other actors misconstruing and assigning meaning to them. In doing so, however, we must recognize the challenge of agency. Assigning any legal salience to silence, whether as acceptance or not, risks marginalizing those States prone to silence, not because of any legal position, but because they may lack the time, knowledge, or capabilities to determine how best to legally characterise hostile cyber-operations, to say nothing of State interests in avoiding engagements that may trigger involvements with opposing hegemonic actors.¹⁰² ## III. State Silences and State Statements on the Application of International Law to Cyber-operations So far, we have assumed at least some international legal regulation of State-sponsored cyber-operations. But that has not always been a safe assumption. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, even as States became more interested (and capable) in conducting cyber-operations, they remained silent on the relevant international legal frameworks governing that behaviour.¹⁰³ The effect of such ¹⁰¹ The same outcome may follow the first option proposed above, denying any legal salience to secret or covert cyber-operations. See supra notes 86-92, and accompanying text. Interestingly, therefore, partial silences are only non-catalysing where their legal content is inferred despite its explicit absence. See supra notes 93-97 and accompanying text.\n¹⁰² Elisabeth Schweiger, Targeted Killing and the Lack of Acquiescence, 32 LEIDEN J.

In 2018, however, Russia proposed States negotiate a treaty to regulate information weapons; the idea received a cool reception from Western states worried that doing so would green-light constraints on privacy and freedom of expression. See Letter dated September 23, 1998 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations concerning Agenda Item 63, U.N. Doc. A/C.1/53/3 (1998). Since then, the Council of Europe concluded a treaty on cyber-crime and discussions are ongoing at the UN for a global cybercrime convention. But aside from these examples (and an African Union treaty that has yet to enter into force), international law offers few cyber-specific conventional regulations.

Did ICT's novelties suggest States should regard cyber-operations, like Internet governance, as largely outside international law's purview, as a case of non liquet, or subject to pre-existing general public international law rules and principles in the absence of overt objections to doing so?¹⁰⁴ As the first edition of the Tallinn Manual summarized it: The threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how. Views on the subject range from a full application of the law of armed conflict, along the lines of the International Court of Justice's pronouncement that it applies to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' to strict application of the Permanent Court of International Justice's pronouncement that acts not forbidden in international law are generally permitted.¹⁰⁵ In 2013, a consensus report by a UN Group of Governmental Experts ('UN GGE') affirmed international law's general applicability.¹⁰⁶ Since then, that position has been reiterated by the UN General Assembly and various regional international organizations.¹⁰⁷ The resolution of existential questions about international law's application overall, however, merely opened the door to debates over which international laws applied. For example, several states, but principally China, resisted accepting any application of international humanitarian law to online behaviours, arguing that doing so would accelerate the Internet's for Negotiating Cybercrime Treaty amid Concerns over 'Rushed' Vote at Expense of Further Consultations, UN Doc. 12328 (May 26, 2021).\n¹⁰⁴ See Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Sousa Dias, Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond, EJILTALK!

For those who insist that generally applicable international law rules already bind States in cyberspace, it might follow that these statements have no salience. Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita Dias, for example, emphasize that International legal rules or principles of general applicability, i.e., applicable under general international law to all types of state activity in the relevant circumstances, such as the prohibition on the use of force, non-intervention, the Corfu Channel rule of 'due diligence', international human rights law and international humanitarian law, thus, do not need further proof of applicability to ICTs or other new technologies via specific state practice and opinio juris 'in cyberspace'. Their scope is sufficiently broad to be interpreted and applied to ICTs. It is the burden of those advocating for ICTs' exclusion from their scope to present evidence that states, in their general practice accepted as law, have actively carved out ICTs.¹⁴ Taking this view one step further, it might be possible to reason that State statements about international law applications are not a constitutive element of customary international law online; and if that is the case, reactive silence to such statements similarly lacks legal salience.\nFor some, however, cyberspace's novelties require States to elaborate new state practice and opinio juris before ascribing legal obligations to States. Consider the views of Israel's Deputy Attorney General: It cannot be automatically presumed that a customary rule applicable in any of the physical domains is also applicable to the cyber domain. The key question in identifying State practice is whether the practice which arose in other domains is closely related to the activity envisaged in the cyber domain. Additionally, it must be ascertained that the opinio juris which gave rise to the customary rules applicable in other domains was not domain-specific. Given the unique characteristics of the cyber domain, such an analysis is to be made with particular prudence, as it is very often the case that relevant differences exist.\nFor supporters of the domain-specific approach, State statements have value as opinio juris, begging the question if they therefore qualify as circumstances calling for a reaction?\n¹³ States have, however, been more vocal in accepting international institutional views on the applicability of international law. See, e.g., Italy, Position Paper on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), ¶3 (concurring with UN GGE and OEWG conclusions on international law's applicability to cyberspace).\n¹⁴ Akande et al., supra note 104.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nWhere State statements have legal salience, their context could signal the audience's acceptance of what the statements say. For some, this conclusion may follow from the technology itself; unlike earlier eras, State views can now be easily expressed, distributed, and aggregated for purposes of assessing *opinio juris*.¹¹⁵ Such capacities may favour considering official State statements as a circumstance calling for a reaction.¹¹⁶ Alternatively, the case for acceptance finds support among ‘specially affected’ States who themselves have the capacity to engage in the same cyber-operations subject to these statements. As Kevin Heller explains, even if silence as consent is controversial, ‘there seems to be widespread acceptance of the idea that specially-affected states, unlike states that are not specially affected, have an obligation to object to a claim concerning the customary status of a practice—and that their silence should be considered support if they do not’.¹¹⁷ There are, however, countervailing possibilities. States may remain silent to avoid giving the statement the further credibility a response might imply.¹¹⁸ Or, they may remain silent to avoid the geopolitical fray that aligning with one set of state views or another would entail.¹¹⁹ Some States also clearly have capacity constraints, both in understanding how cyber-operations work and around the relevant international legal issues they raise. Assigning these silences legal salience risks overburdening States by suggesting they must monitor for, and respond to, the views of all the 190+ nation states whenever they choose to ¹¹⁵ For an example of this in practice, see Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, et al., *Mapping States’ Reactions to the U.S. Strikes Against Syria of April 2018–A Comprehensive Guide*, JUST SECURITY (May 7, 2018).\n¹¹⁶ Evolutions in machine learning are likely to only enhance such capabilities.

Some Member States indicated a reluctance to make similar signals lest they embroil that State in the competition and conflict among these actors; issues States can avoid by staying silent’).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nspeak.¹²⁰ Limiting response obligations to specially affected States (assuming that category can even be identified and the relevant states so designated) could mitigate such concerns, but the secret and covert nature of cyber capacities suggests States may resist conceding capacities for fear it might remove some of their advantages. Big data and machine learning may someday lessen these constraints and equalize state capacities, but those days have yet to arrive.¹²¹ Today, drawing inferences from State silence more likely implicates the agency issues raised above; requiring States to speak out (whether to endorse or oppose other States' statements) involves a political act that would mostly just affirm the power of the States speaking.\nWhatever the legal salience of the ‘reactive’ silence States have offered other States’ statements, it would be a mistake to ignore the silence evident in the more than 150 States who have yet to affirmatively offer their own views on how international law applies in cyberspace. Even if not reactive, such silences appear catalysing. They create space for non-State actors to fill the silence with their own views.¹²² The two *Tallinn Manuals* and the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross serve as the most prominent examples.¹²³ As ‘first movers’, the positions expressed in these efforts have remained influential even among States that decide to break their silence. Thus, even though Germany declined to endorse the second *Tallinn Manual* in its entirety, its own later statement repeatedly and expressly concurs with its views.¹²⁴ Nor is silence’s catalysing effect limited to academic experts. In the landmark surveillance case, *Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v. the UK*, the European Court of Human Rights was able to assess the compliance of the UK’s extraterritorial surveillance regime with the European Convention on Human Rights on ‘the assumption’ that the matters ¹²⁰ On challenges of human and financial resources of Third World states with respect to customary international law, see B.S.

Stymied over how to articulate international law applications in cyberspace, a 2015 UN GGE identified eleven non-binding ‘voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour’.¹²⁶ These norms purport to establish shared expectations of appropriate future behaviour in cyberspace that do not depend on law to establish their logic of appropriateness.¹²⁷ The precise relationship between these norm promotion efforts and international law is unclear. The 2021 OEWG report clarified these ‘norms do not replace or alter States’ obligations or rights under international law, which are binding, but rather provide additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs’, whilst also noting these ‘[n]orms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law’.¹²⁸ The fact remains, however, that subsequent state endorsements of these norms are often partially silent – they do not address whether and which voluntary norms codify pre-existing international legal rules and standards.¹²⁹ IV. Conclusion At first glance, the cyber context has little to contribute to a volume on reactive State silence. Except for one passing comment by a Trump Administration official, there is no relevant international legal discourse on ‘circumstances that call for a reaction’ in cyberspace. States have yet to talk about silence’s salience and there are no court opinions (international or domestic) that raise the topic. Thus, we do not know whether, when, or how reactive silence constructs ¹²⁵ Big Brother Watch &amp; Others v.

As such, we lack requisite evidence to address many of this volume's research questions.¹³⁰ We do not know if the work of non-State actors (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals) or institutional fora (e.g., UN GGE reports) call for a reaction by States, nor whether a legal (viz. a political) claim is necessary to do so. Without recognition of the existence of reactive silences, let alone their thresholds, we have little to say about questions of consistency for purposes of law-production or if the technologies that ICTs represent can impact findings of acquiescence or non-acceptance.\nOn closer examination, however, cyberspace may inform our understanding of State silences in at least three ways. First and foremost, it highlights the importance of distinguishing international legal rhetoric about silence from the fact of its existence. Even if States and other stakeholders have yet to acknowledge it explicitly, our case studies of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law reveal an array of contexts where States have reacted with silence to the claims or conduct of others. Identifying these instances of silence opens the door to the very sorts of interpretations and interactions that have evolved reactive silence in other legal fields. We thus see our chapter as a modest, opening move – an invitation to others to identify and examine incidents of reactive silence in cyberspace and to assess whether they have legal salience, and, if so, whether, when and how they might constitute acceptance, non-acceptance, or opposition.\nSecond, the very inattention reactive silence has received in addressing international law and cyberspace warrants attention. It may, of course, be simply a feature of the field's immaturity that will gradually resolve over time. On the other hand, there may be certain contextual conditions in cyberspace whose existence obstructs any role for reactive silence. Hence, in opening the door to discuss State silences in cyberspace, we also invite consideration of whether and which conditions explain the current silence on State silence.\nConsider, for example, questions of clarity about the existence and meaning of international law itself. Might legal salience for reactive silence require some baseline consensus about what international laws exist or mean in the cyber context before we can assume anything about ensuing silences? Similarly, our discussion of secret and/or covert cyber-operations suggests that reactive silence may depend on some measure of transparency – acknowledged or at least known conduct to which others may react. Does the fact that the underlying behaviour is itself conducted in silence restrict international law's ability to assign value to any reactions, including silence? But even if we could make State behaviours in cyberspace more transparent, questions remain about each State's capacity to ¹³⁰ See Ch. 1, at xx-xx.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\nunderstand the technology, how it works, and what it means for international law generally, let alone reactive silences in particular? At present, cyberspace is rife with capacity questions as the vast majority of States lack sufficient understanding of ICTs as a technical matter, leaving them behind or outside the conduct and conversations of more tech-savvy actors. Assigning silences legal salience in such contexts may not only be difficult but normatively questionable if it enables a form of legal imperialism by those with the most capability to act at the expense of most States who are targeted and/or victimized by other States' behaviour online. The ICT context also suggests that the status quo's susceptibility to change may impact recognition of reactive silences. Given the Internet's dynamic nature, with ICTs constantly evolving (and with them the means and methods by which States operate), it may be difficult to ascribe legal value to responses, silent or otherwise, especially, if at the time, the underlying claims or conduct quickly become outdated or obsolete.\nMore research is needed to assess if clarity, transparency, capability, and/or susceptibility help explain the current silence about State silence in cyberspace. In doing so, we would also invite assessments of whether these conditions may have explanatory value for the state of reactive silence in other areas of international law. Our list is not, however, in any way exhaustive – we would expect that in cyberspace as in other contexts, additional conditions may impact or control reactive silence's contours and contents.\nThird, whatever roles reactive silence occupies in cyberspace, our treatments of Internet governance, State cyber-operations, and State statements about international law suggest the utility of additional perspectives on silences. Our treatment has highlighted two – (i) partial silences where silence is broken in reaction to some conduct or claims but silence about international law itself remains; and (ii) catalysing silences where the absence of claims or conduct involving international law trigger or otherwise facilitate non-international legal institutions (e.g., multistakeholder governance models like ICANN) or norms (e.g., the UN GGE's 11 voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour). State silence may also facilitate non-State actor voices within international law (e.g., the Tallinn Manuals).\nAt present, moreover, we believe both partial and catalysing silences have a much larger impact on the construction of international law in cyberspace than reactive silence. As such, we would call for more attention to these silences across international law more generally to see what impacts, if any, they have had on the law's formation, operation, or efficacy.\nState silence may have been a feature of the early Internet, impacting its evolution and, in turn, the availability of international law and international Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718 DRAFT: WHAT DOES STATE SILENCE SAY?\ninstitutions. Today, in contrast, States are speaking about—and acting in—cyberspace with ever-greater attention and intensity. Rather than diminishing the importance of State silence, however, these voices (and their identities) demand more attention to the legal salience and implications of the silence that remains. Thus, the time is ripe for States to begin to talk about their silence in cyberspace. States and scholars now need to understand when silence can reinforce, rather than undermine, the regulation of the Internet as an open, stable, and secure space for human flourishing and peaceful coexistence among States.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4201718"
