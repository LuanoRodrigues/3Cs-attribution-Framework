However, those depictions are based more on prophecy than they are on historical realities. The historical development of conceptions about cyber operations explains how those themes came to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States. Rather than being self-evident, the themes are a result of the application of early cyber efforts to strategic operations, advocacy that focused on doomsday scenarios to draw attention to cybersecurity problems, and the ease with which cyber threats were tied to the primary strategic narratives of American national security during their development.\n\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 September 2022; Accepted 18 November 2023\n\nKEYWORDS Cyber; Pearl Harbor; cybersecurity; information warfare; information operations; cyberspace; future war\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn his 2011 book Cyber War, Richard Clarke, the former Special Advisor to the President for Cybersecurity, outlined a fictional depiction of a full-scale cyber war in America. His scenario began with the White House Situation Room receiving a message from the National Security Agency (NSA) about multiple malware targeting critical infrastructure before the desk officer subsequently becomes bombarded with messages about systems failing across the country. Department of Defense networks go offline, gas refineries explode in multiple major cities, chemical plants leak poisonous gas into the environment, aeroplanes collide in mid-air after air traffic control centres lose their air picture, and rail traffic ceased due to trains and subways derailing at key junction points.

Americans panic and looting ensues as a result of the breakdown of essential services in the days that follow, which completely overwhelms the police and emergency services. He concluded by saying that 'A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country'.\n\nWhile notable for the exceedingly grim nature of his prediction, it is largely consistent with the chorus of prognostications regarding the impact that cyber operations will play in the future. As Andy Greenberg at Wired puts it, 'The threat of cyberwar looms over the future: a new dimension of conflict capable of leapfrogging borders and teleporting the chaos of war to civilians thousands of miles beyond its front'. Fiction literature about the future of war is riddled with these themes. Ghost Fleet, a novel by political scientist and futurist P. W. Singer, details a Chinese surprise attack against the United States that largely succeeds due to crippling cyber-attacks against American weapon systems and infrastructure. Similarly, Admiral James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman's novel 2034 includes cyber-attacks that cause national power blackouts and government computer lockouts, while also disabling fighter aircraft and naval vessels across the globe. The themes are not unique to fictional stories though – indeed, the authors included those elements in the plotlines precisely because they capture the fears of policymakers in the real world. Testifying before Congress in 2011, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta talked about how the next Pearl Harbor-type attack likely could come from a cyber-attack. 'If you have a cyber-attack that brings down our power-grid system, brings down our financial system, brings down our government systems, you could paralyze this country ... And I think that's a real potential'. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, echoed the sentiment and said that the threat from cyber operations 'is increasing in scope and scale, and its impact is difficult to overstate'.\n\nInterestingly, these images of cyber operations seem to be grounded in prophesy rather than historical realities. While cyber has become associated with the image of a catastrophic surprise attack, the history of cyber-attacks has been dominated by the less dramatic elements of espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Likewise, the strategic state conflicts that have included cyber elements did not include surprise cyber-attacks. Instead, they took place in larger geopolitical conflicts that offered ample warning time for\n\n1Richard A.

The question becomes, how have these themes come to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States?\n\nUnfortunately, little work has been done to understand the historical development of cyber thinking. In fact, literature on the history of cyber operations in general is rather sparse. Fred Kaplan's Dark Territory is perhaps the most well-known work, but as a journalist writing for a popular audience, it does not provide many details regarding its source material. The Atlantic Council's A Fierce Domain, edited by Jason Healey, is the best scholarly work. It provides a general background but its primary focus is several case studies documenting specific cyber events. USCYBERCOM's historian, Michael Warner, has also written a number of useful articles on the history of cyber operations. However, even fewer authors have explored the intellectual and cultural history of cyber thinking. Thomas Rid's Cyber War Will Not Take Place includes historical case studies and makes an argument that cyber operations should not be considered a form of warfare, but he does not fully trace how contemporaries considered them, how those conceptions changed over time, nor what factors influenced those changes. His Rise of the Machines provides a rich history of the ideas and field of cybernetics, which tangentially relates to cyber operations, but it does not examine the idea of cyber operations directly. Sarah White's recent doctoral thesis titled Subcultural Influences on Military Innovation: The Development of U.S. Military Cyber Doctrine comes closest to documenting the progression of thought, but it more specifically explores the influence of service culture and operational experience on military approaches to new technologies.\n\nYet understanding that historical development is vitally important. Charting the history of conceptions about cyber operations provides critical insights into how the current images of cyber rose to such prominence in the American psyche. The ideas were not self-evident but instead were formed and framed by several cultural, social, political, and military factors and events. Understanding the evolution of those conceptions is also no mere\n\n4Jason Healey, 'A Brief History of US Cyber Conflict', in Jason Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain (Washington DC: Cyber Conflict Studies Association 2013), 17.\n5For a great historical study of the conceptual development of strategic bombing and the impact those conceptions had in the employment of bombers in World War II, see Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press 2004).",

Moreover, knowing the assumptions and reasoning that underpinned the early development of strategic thinking can facilitate more thoughtful policy and strategy in the future. Outlining the flow of ideas from previous generations enables leaders and policymakers to better assess their own assumptions and reasoning as they wrestle with current and future challenges.\n\nIn examining the historical development of American strategic thought regarding cyber operations, three major themes influenced how cyber was conceived leading up to the creation of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009. First, initial cyber capability development in the United States occurred in the context of strategic operations. The primary targets for initial cyber operations, the impact they sought to produce, and the problems they tried to solve all centred around nuclear operations or strategic leadership decision-making. Second, the increasing interconnectivity of critical data and infrastructure meant that cyber operations could theoretically have massive impacts on the economy and national security. Early advocates regularly focused on these doomsday possibilities in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage. Finally, early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives regarding nuclear war and high-profile terrorism. The potential impact and low barrier of entry of cyber operations made it easy for senior leaders to associate cyber with those strategic narratives. These three threads emerge as the most formative themes in the development of conceptions about cyber, and they led senior leaders to view cyber capabilities as strategic weapons capable of impacts on par with weapons of mass destruction.\n\n## A note on definitions\n\nProviding clear and unified definitions for cyber and cyberspace is a recurring struggle and theme of the history of military cyber efforts. Definitions for terms like cyberspace, cyber operations, information warfare, command and control warfare, and others have evolved throughout time. As such, it is difficult to use terms consistently throughout the article, particularly because there was significant overlap between the various terms and they were used almost synonymously during certain periods of time. However, the intent is to understand how cyberspace and cyber operations came to be understood as they are today.\n\nSince 2008, joint doctrine has defined cyberspace as ‘A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet,",

Essentially, they refer to operations that disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, along with operations taken to prevent others from doing the same. When military members talk of using 'cyber' to disrupt an integrated air defence system, suggest that the next war will begin with 'cyber', or talk of a 'cyber' officer, they are typically referring to cyber as a distinct military capability that includes using a computer system to achieve some effect on another computer system or its information, while also trying to prevent the same from occurring on one's own systems. It is in that sense that I use the terms cyber and cyber operations.\n\n# Cyber precursors\n\nDisrupting an adversary's communications, information warfare, and using the electromagnetic spectrum to achieve objectives are not new phenomena. However, the march towards the modern version of conflict within cyberspace began because of two trends in the latter half of the  $21^{\\text{st}}$  century. First, the exponential growth of electrical computing technology and its proliferation within the security apparatus increasingly presented the possibility of exploitation by adversaries. Second, the movement towards storing and transporting wealth and secrets in digital data, along with the growth of strategic systems reliant on computers and networking, produced growing motivation for adversaries to take advantage of those possibilities. Together, these trends gradually produced and elevated cyber-related issues as concerns for national security.\n\nAlmost from the very beginning of the digital revolution, analysts identified inherent security issues with the explosion of digital technology in the\n\n^{6}\nUnited States Air Force, Air Force Doctrine Publications 3-12 - Cyberspace Operations (Washington DC 2023), 6, https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/AFDP_3-12/3-12-AFDP-CYBERSPACE-OPS.pdf.\n\n^{7}\nDepartment of Defense, United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms (Washington DC: Department of Defense 2019), 233.\n\n8Michael Warner, 'A Brief History of Cyber Conflict', in Schneider et al.

Thomas Rona, a Boeing advisor to the Secretary of Defense's Office of Net Assessment, wrote a paper in 1976 titled 'Weapon Systems and Information War' that wrestled with the challenges introduced by the information age. He noted that the growing complexity of weapon systems meant that they were increasingly dependent upon external information sources for successful engagements, whether it be intelligence, targeting information, or command and control orders.[9] That dependency created the possibility that weapon systems could be defeated through information denial. Of course, these changes produced both opportunities and vulnerabilities – information warfare could cut both ways. The United States needed to consider how to attack an adversary's information flow as well as how it would protect its own.[10] While his report focused on information warfare predominantly as a means to defeat weapon systems, Rona recognized that there were broader implications and opportunities for strategic warfare.[11]\n\nWhile Rona looked at information warfare broadly applied to weapons, others focused more specifically on the threat to command and control. As computers became more integrated with the control and employment of force, military members increasingly regarded them as critical assets that required defending as well as potential targets that could be exploited. A 1976 Defense Science Board study on conventional force counters to a Warsaw Pact attack highlighted how disruption of Soviet troop control systems could serve as a critical counterbalance to their numerical superiority.[12] As American awareness subsequently grew regarding Soviet reliance on a tightly controlled and automated system for directing their forces, the military increasingly viewed attacks on the Soviet command and control structure as vital force multipliers. Consequently, the Department of Defense (DoD) began developing a set of doctrinal ideas eventually known as command-and-control warfare (C2W) in 1979 in an effort to negate the numerical advantage of Soviet forces. C2W concepts became highly intertwined with those of information warfare over the next two decades, and both served as the cocoon within which military conceptions of cyber operations initially developed.\n\nThe increasing digitization also produced greater overlap with signals intelligence techniques. While traditional communications collection relied on intercepting analog signals transmitted on telephone lines or broadcast over the air, digital signals required more robust processing to break out the data and information.

Thus, they were also optimally positioned to be able to manipulate that information or the systems they resided within.\n\nAs signals intelligence produced greater access into Soviet systems, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought to operationalize them in 1982 through a little-known organization called the Joint Special Studies Group. According to Bruce Berkowitz, the purpose of JSSG was to ‘determine whether vulnerabilities identified from critical node analysis, such as message intercepts, jamming, and signals injection into adversary networks, could be turned into a military or intelligence capability'. The goal was to find ways to affect their automated command and control network or to sow doubts about the integrity of the information in the minds of Soviet leaders. By 1984 though, policymakers, including President Ronald Reagan, began to get concerned about the ability to control the effects of information warfare techniques, especially since they were directed toward strategic Soviet systems and could create considerable problems if they went awry. In the end, while the JSSG was able to model Soviet nuclear communication networks, they never discovered a silver bullet to guarantee disruption of communications, and the program was shut down in 1989 with the end of the Cold War. However, their concepts served as major forerunners to Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA).\n\nJust as the Joint Chiefs were standing up the JSSG, elements within pop culture began to use hacking-related themes that impacted national security in surprising ways. The 1983 film WarGames starring Matthew Broderick initiated several governmental actions regarding computer security and created enduring conceptions of the cyber threat. The movie details a teenage hacker who almost starts a global nuclear war when he accidentally hacks into a supercomputer at NORAD. In June of 1983, Reagan watched the film while on retreat at Camp David and he proceeded to discuss the plot with members of Congress as well as his national security staff. According to journalist Fred Kaplan, Reagan's inquiries into whether the film's plot could play out in real life led him to discover that the threat of computer intrusion was even worse than he imagined. The subsequent string of events ultimately led to the confidential National Security Decision Directive 145 (NSDD-",

The three major television networks ran a flurry of reports about computer and networking technology using WarGames as a framework for understanding their inherent dangers. Also, much of the reporting discussed it in the context of nuclear war.[20] A four-minute clip from the movie was shown at the opening of congressional hearings on computer security and representatives referenced the film throughout the hearings to help members conceptualize the threat.[21] Ultimately, those hearings led to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984.[22] Not only did the film enable both Presidential and Congressional action, but the movie also popularized the impression that hacking was the realm of anti-establishment teenagers and a potential weapon for global destruction.[23] Those conceptions provided a powerful framing effect for subsequent cyber events.\n\n# The Morris worm and Desert Storm\n\nOnly a couple of years later, a real-world event both resonated with and evolved those conceptions.

While many researchers understood that networks and computers were vulnerable, the speed with which the virus spread across such extensive networks gave them a queasy feeling that they had experienced a close call.[26] A few simple alterations would have enabled the worm to destroy massive amounts of data or compromise large portions of sensitive research and defence information.[27] The ease and rapidity of its spread led pundits and officials to begin to ask about the vulnerability of other computer networks that business and infrastructure increasingly depended on. If a single individual could achieve such widespread effects, what could an individual do if they targeted systems associated with national security?\n\nUnsurprisingly, the event helped reinforce the early image of the malicious individual as the primary threat in cyberspace. While numerous news articles noted that the worm served as a giant wake-up call, the threat was commonly framed as one from hackers and terrorists as opposed to nation states or militaries.[28] That image was fortified by Dutch teenagers hacking into 34 American military installation networks between 1990–91, and young British hackers accessing networks at the Air Force's Rome Labs before routing through to a South Korean nuclear institute in 1994.[29] Policymakers increasingly worried about the impact well-resourced and determined individuals could have if teenagers were able to access such a wide swath of computers. Computer security expert Winn Schwartau did little to abate those fears when he testified in congress in 1991 that governmental and commercial systems were essentially defenceless and an 'electronic Pearl Harbor' was waiting to happen.[30] As early as the late 1980s, conceptions about cyber threats as primarily coming from malignant individuals and capable of devastating impact were already front and centre in the national dialogue about cyber.\n\nJust as Morris was going to trial, President George H.

Many American defence experts concluded that the resulting information differential proved critical to the subsequent speed and ease with which America and its allies routed Iraqi forces. $^{32}$  As a result, the victory shoved thinking about information warfare into overdrive among the defence community. As military thinkers sought to understand the roots of the success in order to replicate it in the future, many concluded that information warfare was the secret weapon for quick and decisive victories going forward.\n\nThe DoD quickly directed the services to organize and train for information warfare in then-classified DoD Directive 3600.1 (DODD TS-3600.1), titled Information Warfare and released in December 1992. It served as the first indication that elements of modern-day cyber were entering the official policy of the military. The Department formally defined information warfare as\n\nthe competition of opposing information systems to include the exploitation, corruption, or destruction of an adversary's information systems through such means as signals intelligence and command and control countermeasures while protecting the integrity of one's own information systems from such attacks. The objective of information warfare is to attain a significant enough information advantage to enable the force overall to predominate and to do so quickly.[33]\n\nThe directive essentially tied together many of the related concepts the military had been experimenting with in the previous two decades. It combined the signals-intelligence-enabled precursors to cyber operations, which the military created to counter Soviet nuclear command and control, with the broader C2W ideas developed prior to and then used in Desert Storm. And it was all with the intent of replicating the speed and success of the Gulf War in future conflicts. While the directive served as the introduction of information warfare into defence policy, it was only the beginning, as the post-war period spawned a flurry of ideas and thinking about information warfare from which cyber would later emerge.\n\n31 Alan D.

The pacing threat for the previous four decades suddenly disappeared and America found itself the lone superpower on the world stage.[34] The vacuum created by the dissolution of the USSR was quickly filled by a focus on high-profile terrorism. As the Soviet empire collapsed, the threat of Soviet nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue nations became a palpable fear for national leadership. The rise of high-profile terrorism as the most pressing security issue of the new century had a direct effect on the development of strategic thinking about cyberspace for the next two decades.\n\n# Terrorism and cyber Pearl Harbors\n\nPresident William Clinton's administration became the first to systematically deal with the issue of terrorism as it faced several terrorist attacks in the first years of his presidency.[35] However, it was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that proved most impactful on the president and for cyber operations. The bombing moved him personally, and it led him to wonder about the threat terrorists could pose to more strategic or symbolic locations throughout the country.[36] Through a number of subsequent events, he eventually appointed a Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (later known as the Marsh Commission after its lead, John Marsh) to investigate the vulnerability of important facilities to terrorist attacks.\n\nThe release of the commission's final report in October of 1997 surprised many by focusing primarily on cyber threats as opposed to traditional physical attacks. The commission noted that all critical infrastructure was dependent on unsecure information technology.[37] While the commission did not find evidence of impending cyber-attacks, it did discover widespread capabilities to exploit infrastructure vulnerabilities. Further, because the commission was created primarily to consider terrorist threats, it largely described the threat from cyber as coming from terrorists and criminals vice nation-state actors.[38] The report never explicitly compared cyber to nuclear weapons but, as with much of the contemporaneous literature, cyber threats were mentioned in the same context as terrorists using weapons of mass destruction.\n\n34George C.

In contrast ... a personal computer and a telephone connection to an Internet Service Provider anywhere in the world are enough to cause harm'.39 In reality, the cyber threat from terrorists would largely prove non-existent over the next twenty-five years.40 However, the report's focus on the devastation that a cyber-attack could cause to highly-vulnerable critical infrastructure, and its concentration on terrorists as the primary threat actors, further solidified conceptions of cyber-attacks as catastrophic surprise attacks that were launched by malignant individuals.\n\nThe urgent tone of the report was underscored by several prominent events that occurred within a couple of years of its release. In June 1997, the JCS launched a no-notice exercise known as ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 97 to test the cyber defences of DoD networks and critical infrastructure. The exercise was the brainchild of NSA Director Lt Gen Kenneth Minihan, who was frustrated at how little the DoD accounted for the threats or opportunities cyber presented in his previous years leading Air Force cyber operations.[41] Thirty-five NSA red-team hackers split into two teams—one in the United States and one on a ship in the Pacific. Armed with no inside information, and using only store-bought computers and hacking tools downloaded from the internet, they proceeded to run rampant through networks leaving marker files to prove where they had been.[42] According to Kaplan's interviews, the portion of the exercise devoted to national infrastructure attacks was a tabletop exercise without real-world intrusions. However, the attackers were actually allowed to penetrate defence networks for the other portion. In doing so, they were able to access the National Military Command Center, send false emails, reformat hard drives, alter communications, shut down phone lines, and sow doubt into command and control – much of what C2W and information warfare had envisioned throughout the preceding decade.[43] John Campbell, the Major General in charge of information operations on the Joint Staff, put it bluntly when he said, ‘... frankly it scared the hell out of a lot of folks because the implications of what this team had been able to do were pretty far-reaching’.[44] DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that it had ‘succeeded beyond its planner’s wildest dreams in elevating the awareness of threats to our computer systems’.[45] It shocked DoD Deputy\n\n39Ibid., x.\n40While terrorists have relied heavily on the internet for recruiting, communications, and fundraising, there have been no major cyber-attacks or intrusions from terrorists; see Healey, Fierce Domain, 64.\n41Kaplan, Dark Territory, 64.\n42Healey, Fierce Domain, 42.\n43Kaplan, Dark Territory, 69-70.\n44John Campbell, 'Lessons from Our Cyber Past, The First Military Cyber Units', in Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain, 56.\n45Warner, 'Cybersecurity', 797.",

We didn't really let them take down the power system in the country, but we made them prove they knew how to do it'.46 ELIGIBLE RECEIVER provided a vivid example to policymakers of what the Marsh Commission had discussed only in hypotheticals, and it magnified the threat of information warfare to senior leaders on the Joint Staff.\n\nWhile the DoD was still processing the lessons learned from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, the Department experienced a series of intrusions in February 1998 dubbed SOLAR SUNRISE that sparked fears of the beginning of a real-world cyber war. Hamre, with the previous exercise fresh on his mind, notified the President early in the intrusions and said that the incident 'might be the first shots of a genuine cyber war, perhaps by Iraq'.[47] At the time, tensions were particularly high over Iraq's lack of cooperation with United Nations inspectors regarding its weapons of mass destruction program. Several intrusions were traced to the Middle East, leading many to believe Iraqi involvement. It proved to be an embarrassing example of the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace, as it turned out to be the work of California teenagers aided by an Israeli mentor.[48] Hamre later called it 'the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date', and it emotionally underlined leaders' previous fears from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER and the Marsh Commission, even though it ultimately had little impact.[49]\n\nIt was in the environment of these prominent events that the Pearl Harbor analogy gained significant steam as officials tried to grow awareness of cyber threats. In the events that led to the Marsh Commission, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified to Congress, 'There is a present threat ... We have not yet had a terrorist cyber-attack on the infrastructure. But I think that that is just a matter of time. We do not need to wait for the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor before we wake up to the threat and take steps to confront it'.[50] Senator Sam Nunn, who led the Congressional hearings, later said that the two most significant dangers America faced were terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons and a cyber Pearl Harbor.[51] In other hearings,\n\n46John J.

In a late 1998 press conference, he commented that ‘The threat of an electronic Pearl Harbor or the threat of cyber-terrorism . . . is clearly one that’s getting increasing attention in this building and throughout the government’.53\n\nDespite the chorus of predictions about cyber doomsday, some cautioned against the comparison. They noted that an attacker would need significant knowledge of the operating systems, hardware, and networks, as well as the interaction between all of those components, to create the systemic effects that experts warned about. The primary threat for that level of attack would more likely arise from a dedicated team of professionals employed by a nation-state. Thus, an attack would likely take place in a specific geopolitical context rather than being a bolt out of the blue.54 Nevertheless, the analogy became very popular and continued to gain steam over the next twenty years in sounding the alarm over cyber threats.\n\n## Increasing cyber awareness\n\nThe inclusion of cyber threats in the National Security Strategies (NSS) during this period further reflected the government’s growing acceptance of the role of cyber in security issues. The 1997 NSS was the first to allude to cyber when it commented on technology making transnational threats more potent than before.55 It also included the first NSS comment – albeit a minor one – on the need to protect critical infrastructure from intrusion.56 The next NSS in 1999 indicated how much cyber thought advanced from the events of the intervening years. Defending critical infrastructure from paralyzing attacks was added to the list of vital national interests, alongside protecting the nation’s territory, citizens, allies, and economic well-being.57 In the large portions devoted to infrastructure, it focused heavily on the threats from cyberspace. As with other documents of the era, cyber-attacks were included in the list of technology advancements, along with weapons of mass destruction, that enabled terrorists or rogue nations to pose a greater risk than before.

The 1999 NSS was also the first to discuss the importance of information superiority to military readiness and command and control.[58]\n\nThe inclusion of information superiority in the NSS was a manifestation of the DoD's growing concern about information warfare throughout the period. The ongoing defence dialogue on information warfare adapted to and folded in many of the same insights and ideas that the Marsh Commission, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, and the SOLAR SUNRISE intrusions identified. Other internal studies and exercises only added to the concerns. Recognizing that the growth of cyberspace would profoundly impact national security, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a series of exercises on information warfare in 1996 to help develop a national information warfare strategy.[59] Their report identified that much of national infrastructure (what the Marsh Commission would later include in critical infrastructure) was connected to the internet and attacks on such would take on a strategic aspect. Thus, they framed the challenge as 'strategic information warfare'.[60] The more their participants became aware of information warfare's possibilities in the exercises, the more fearful they became of the impacts it could have. Only a couple of months later, the General Accounting Office warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the problems plaguing the civilian internet were increasingly threatening DoD information systems. They reported that 'The potential for catastrophic damage is great. Organized foreign nationals or terrorists could use \"information warfare\" techniques to disrupt military operations by harming command and control systems, the public switch network, and other systems or networks Defense relies on'.[61] Further, a report from the Defense Science Board Task Force on Information Warfare Defense in November of 1996 stated that cyberspace threats to infrastructure created 'a tunnel of vulnerability previously unrealized in the history of conflict'.[62] The possibilities of information warfare became increasingly dire the more military leaders considered it.\n\nThe arrival of the new century brought more high-profile cyber issues and they too were accompanied by a continual chorus of fears about cyber destruction. The year 2000 itself created significant concern in the computer community over the potential impacts it would have on how computers\n\n58Ibid., 12.\n59Roger C. Molander, Andrew S.

There was widespread concern at the time that power, transportation, banking, and other critical systems would fail at midnight and cause the extensive panic envisioned in the cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios. Several internet worms also garnered significant attention around the same time. ILOVEYOU, Melissa, Code Red, NIMDA, SQL Slammer, and others captured headlines and the awareness of Americans. In February of 2000, a 16-year-old Canadian used a program downloaded off the internet to conduct a distributed-denial-of-service attack against Amazon, CNN, eBay, Yahoo, and others. Not only did it make headlines for simultaneously hitting several big companies, but it led President Clinton to organize the first White House roundtable on cybersecurity. While these public hacks drew a lot of press, none of them was deeply impactful, nor did they directly influence national security issues outside of elevating the prominence of cyber within the national conscious writ large. The most concerning thing about them was the constant drumbeat of articles warning that more dangerous attacks were imminent and that it was only a matter of time before cyber-terrorists brought the nation to its knees.\n\nA major cyber-espionage case in early 2001 actually did have a significant impact on the DoD, though its effects came in the form of information compromise. A series of intrusions dubbed MOONLIGHT MAZE launched a high-profile, multi-year investigation and provided the first indication of a changing threat environment. The details are still classified but the incursions appeared to have begun in March 1998 and affected hundreds of computers at NASA, the Pentagon, other governmental agencies, private universities, and research labs. SOLAR SUNRISE was a scare, but this event became truly worrying for policymakers. They appeared to be the first major intrusions conducted by a nation-state, they lasted for several years with disturbingly few clues about who was behind them or what they were taking, and the government could not seem to stop them. Evidence suggested Russian actors targeting unclassified sensitive technical research matters, but the sparse details caused discomfort.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre, ever on the lookout for a cyber conflict, allegedly told congressional colleagues, 'We're in the middle of a cyberwar'.\n\nUnfortunately, everything in the national security apparatus turned upside down when the fears about a massive terrorist attack against critical American facilities became reality on 11 September of that year. While it neither came via cyber means nor did it cripple America, it did drastically revector the nation's defence as it absorbed the shock of the attacks and gradually funnelled its response into the Global War on Terror. In a continuation of the trends of the previous half-decade, news articles in the weeks following the attacks continued to warn that cyberspace would likely provide the vector for the next big strike. The shock of September  $11^{\\text{th}}$  further cemented a fear of massive surprise attacks from unknown dark forces in the American psyche.\n\n# Cyber authorities and the first cyber strategies\n\nAs the United States began both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the concepts for cyber operations as a distinct military capability began to solidify and mature, enabling further development of authorities and strategies for operating in cyberspace. While cyber was increasingly talked about as something distinct from information warfare, the two were still deeply intertwined and often used interchangeably into the 2000s. That began to change in official policy in late 1996 but it took several years for the distinction to fully materialize. In then-classified DoD Directive S-3600.1, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White rechristened information warfare to information operations and, for the first time in official documents, defined computer network attack. However, as cyber gradually emerged from information warfare as a distinct capability, its development and maturation were directly influenced by the conceptions formed over the previous two decades.\n\nThe Bush Administration's attempts to provide increased clarity on authorities for cyber operations in the run-up to the war shed light on American leadership's conceptions of cyber at that point in time. The Washington Post reported that Bush signed the classified National Security Presidential Directive 16 (NSPD-16) in July of 2002 to provide the first national-level guidance on when and how the United States would launch cyber-attacks against an adversary.[73] Predictably, the article likened the development to\n\n71Vernon Loeb, 'NSA Adviser Says Cyber-Assaults On Pentagon Persist With Few Clues', The Washington Post, 7 May 2001, https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nsa-adviser-says-cyber-assaults-on-pentagon/docview/409117447/se-2?accountid=4332.\n\n72We're in the Middle of a Cyberwar', Newsweek, 19 September 1999.\n\n73Bradley Graham, 'Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare', The Washington Post, 7 February 2003, https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-pr04/readings/week5/bush_guidelines..",

However, the article also discussed how the administration and the DoD were still wrestling with some of the aspects of cyber conflict and whether it should be unleashed. According to the article, part of the hesitation to launch attacks stemmed from America's vulnerability to cyber and concerns about establishing a norm that could be used against the United States. Richard Clarke, who had recently resigned from his post as Special Advisor to the President on Cybersecurity, highlighted another concern when he said, ‘There also is an issue, frankly, that's similar to the strategic nuclear issue which is: Do you ever want to do it? Do you want to legitimize that kind of weaponry?' The article insightfully concluded by saying, ‘Given the newness of the weapons, their potential power and the uncertainty about how they would work, the Pentagon's Joint Staff has issued classified “rules of engagement” that strictly require top-level approval for any cyber-attack'.\n\nThe DoD's then-classified Information Operations Roadmap, released in October of 2003, provided additional insights into the insider discussions regarding cyber authorities as well as military conceptions of cyber operations. The roadmap maintained five components for information operations but it replaced physical destruction with Computer Network Operations (CNO). It also included several recommendations devoted to CNA and Computer Network Defence (CND). One notable recommendation was that United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM, the parent command for cyber operations at the time) classify CNA capabilities into more refined categories that could allow for differentiated levels of authority to use them. The roadmap proposed three categories of weapons: those that could be allocated to a combatant commander, those pre-allocated to support aspects of specified operational or contingency plans, and those that were not assigned to combatant commanders and therefore required Secretary or Presidential approval. Not only was it remarkable as the first attempt to distinguish between levels of cyber weapons, rather than merely thinking of cyber as a single capability, but it also demonstrated that the authority to use cyber-attack techniques would still be restricted to very high-levels. It highlighted how, even with a more refined understanding of cyber weaponization, there was still a significant reticence to use them.\n\nThe advancement of cyber operations as a distinct military element itself accelerated in the years that followed.

The then-classified National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations presented a far more nuanced and robust understanding of the domain than previous unclassified doctrine or policy statements. It provided an updated definition for cyberspace along with a list of domain characteristics and key features that drove the strategy's development.[78] The only strategic end that has been declassified was the first one, which sought to deter adversaries 'from establishing or employing offensive capabilities against US interests in cyberspace'.[79] It is unclear if 'establishing' referred to preventing the development of cyber capabilities. If so, it would have been a lofty goal to say the least, as the low barrier to entry made it virtually impossible to stop. However, it would have mirrored concepts of nuclear non-proliferation, which seek to prevent nations from even developing nuclear weapons in the first place due to their destructive power. In pursuing deterrence by imposing costs, denying benefits, and 'inducing adversary restraint based on demonstrated US capabilities', the strategy ultimately echoed elements within existing nuclear deterrence theory.[80]\n\nAlthough defence and national security leadership matured their ideas and strategy concerning cyberspace in the early years of the Global War on Terror, it did not become a major personal focus for President George W. Bush until the end of his time in office. However, that changed with a meeting in April 2007. It appears that President Bush approved a covert action request within the first five minutes of what was supposed to be an hour-long meeting.[81] Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), took advantage of the newly-available fifty-five minutes to talk to the president about McConnell's concerns for national cyber defence – a major topic of anxiety for him. McConnell would later talk about cyber threats, specifically an attack against the financial industry or critical infrastructure, as one of the primary threats that kept him up at night.[82] His inclusion of cyber as a new weapon of mass destruction alongside nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the same interview clearly demonstrated how he thought about the threat from cyber operations.[83] McConnell used the time with\n\n78Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Military Strategy of Cyberspace Operations, December 2006.

In Playing to the Edge, Hayden provided the only primary source material when he specifically credited DNI McConnell with selling Bush on the 'immediacy of the cyber threat and convinced him to launch the CNCI', 177. Kaplan's Dark Territory includes a more in-depth telling of events based on his interviews of unknown members, 174-178. Clarke's Cyber War provides fewer details than Kaplan but they largely agree with Kaplan's narrative, 114.\n82Mike McConnell, interview by Charlie Rose, The Charlie Rose Show, PBS, 8 January 2009. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Speeches%20and%20Interviews/20090108_interview.pdf\n83Ibid.",

To punctuate his point to Bush, McConnell purportedly told the president that if Al Qaeda had been smarter, they would have launched a cyber-attack against a major bank in New York City and corrupted the files, which would have caused more economic damage than the attack on the Twin Towers.[84]\n\nThe discussion apparently lit a fire under the president and he directed McConnell to quickly produce a solution.[85] When McConnell later told the president that the plan would be expensive, Bush allegedly said that he was willing to spend as much as had been spent on the Manhattan Project to work towards solutions.[86] The result was the then-classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative as outlined in NSPD-54 Cybersecurity Policy. The initiative sought to improve the defence of government systems as well as those critical to national security, national economic security, or public health and safety.[87] While the funding details are not clear, it was reported to include tens of billions of dollars, which demonstrated the administration's level of concern over the issue.[88] The initiative was rebranded by the incoming Obama administration but largely kept the same structure. The growing conceptions regarding both the threats and opportunities of cyber operations eventually led Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to approve the stand-up of a combatant command dedicated to the domain of cyberspace the following year.[89]\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe historical development of cyber within the United States leading up to the creation of USCYBERCOM demonstrates several recurring themes that shaped national and defence leaders' conceptions about cyber operations. The first theme is that cyber operations were birthed in strategic applications. They were first introduced to disrupt and defeat Soviet nuclear forces and their command and control. Those concepts were later applied against Iraqi leadership in Desert Storm with smashing success. The desire to replicate such a definitive victory in future conflicts spawned two subsequent decades\n\n84Kaplan, Dark Territory, 174.\n85Kaplan's Dark Territory records Bush saying he wanted a solution in thirty days, 175, while Clarke's Cyber War quoted him saying, 'I want a plan, soon, real soon', 114.\n86Kaplan, Dark Territory, 178.\n87National Security Presidential Directive, 54, Cybersecurity Policy, 8 January 2008, 4. https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-54.pdf.

The growing interconnectivity of vital data, networks, and infrastructure meant that those elements were becoming progressively more vulnerable to cyber threats. The strategic nature of those targets meant that cyber operations could theoretically have strategic impacts on critical societal and warfighting functions, which dominated senior leaders' thinking about the threat. Early advocates regularly used the doomsday possibility of a ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage.\n\nThe final theme is that early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives concentrated on nuclear war and high-profile terrorism, and it became easily interwoven with both. Computers and the internet were exciting and novel technologies to the majority of Americans during the early days of cyber, including senior leaders, but few understood much about how either computers or the internet worked. However, they were regularly told that a teenager with a computer bought at RadioShack could now cause disruption on the scale of nuclear weapons. Additionally, most of the cyber-attacks they read about in the news came from mischievous individuals as bolts out of the blue. Cyber operations were thus easily linked in the minds of senior leaders to the leading security issues of the times -- nuclear weapons and high-profile terrorism.\n\nUntil further information is declassified regarding cyber operations that occurred during the time period, it will be impossible to fully assess how much the rhetoric matched reality. Still, the context within which strategic thought develops influences the direction that it will go. Although obvious when stated, it is a truism that strategists and leaders neglect at their own peril. The context surrounding the development of thought regarding cyberspace in America affected the frameworks, authorities, and operations that leaders applied to the domain, potentially to the benefit and detriment of national security. Fears of a cyber Pearl Harbor enabled advocates to garner attention and resources for cyber issues. However, the focus on catastrophic attacks led to an underappreciation of how a campaign of individually inconsequential events can shape geopolitical contexts towards favourable ends. Early intrusions by computer-savvy teenagers highlighted the insecure nature of networks and facilitated the initial development of cybersecurity. Yet they also created unrealistic expectations in leaders about how easy it would be for future cyber operators to create on-order effects against hard targets.

However, those depictions are based more on prophecy than they are on historical realities. The historical development of conceptions about cyber operations explains how those themes came to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States. Rather than being self-evident, the themes are a result of the application of early cyber efforts to strategic operations, advocacy that focused on doomsday scenarios to draw attention to cybersecurity problems, and the ease with which cyber threats were tied to the primary strategic narratives of American national security during their development.\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 September 2022; Accepted 18 November 2023\nKEYWORDS Cyber; Pearl Harbor; cybersecurity; information warfare; information operations; cyberspace; future war\n# Introduction\nIn his 2011 book Cyber War, Richard Clarke, the former Special Advisor to the President for Cybersecurity, outlined a fictional depiction of a full-scale cyber war in America. His scenario began with the White House Situation Room receiving a message from the National Security Agency (NSA) about multiple malware targeting critical infrastructure before the desk officer subsequently becomes bombarded with messages about systems failing across the country. Department of Defense networks go offline, gas refineries explode in multiple major cities, chemical plants leak poisonous gas into the environment, aeroplanes collide in mid-air after air traffic control centres lose their air picture, and rail traffic ceased due to trains and subways derailing at key junction points. Within a manner of minutes, national power grids are taken offline and the financial system is locked up by the disappearance of\nCONTACT Cameron L.

Americans panic and looting ensues as a result of the breakdown of essential services in the days that follow, which completely overwhelms the police and emergency services. He concluded by saying that 'A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country'.\nWhile notable for the exceedingly grim nature of his prediction, it is largely consistent with the chorus of prognostications regarding the impact that cyber operations will play in the future. As Andy Greenberg at Wired puts it, 'The threat of cyberwar looms over the future: a new dimension of conflict capable of leapfrogging borders and teleporting the chaos of war to civilians thousands of miles beyond its front'. Fiction literature about the future of war is riddled with these themes. Ghost Fleet, a novel by political scientist and futurist P. W. Singer, details a Chinese surprise attack against the United States that largely succeeds due to crippling cyber-attacks against American weapon systems and infrastructure. Similarly, Admiral James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman's novel 2034 includes cyber-attacks that cause national power blackouts and government computer lockouts, while also disabling fighter aircraft and naval vessels across the globe. The themes are not unique to fictional stories though – indeed, the authors included those elements in the plotlines precisely because they capture the fears of policymakers in the real world. Testifying before Congress in 2011, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta talked about how the next Pearl Harbor-type attack likely could come from a cyber-attack. 'If you have a cyber-attack that brings down our power-grid system, brings down our financial system, brings down our government systems, you could paralyze this country ... And I think that's a real potential'. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, echoed the sentiment and said that the threat from cyber operations 'is increasing in scope and scale, and its impact is difficult to overstate'.\nInterestingly, these images of cyber operations seem to be grounded in prophesy rather than historical realities. While cyber has become associated with the image of a catastrophic surprise attack, the history of cyber-attacks has been dominated by the less dramatic elements of espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Likewise, the strategic state conflicts that have included cyber elements did not include surprise cyber-attacks. Instead, they took place in larger geopolitical conflicts that offered ample warning time for\n1Richard A. Clarke, Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It (New York, NY: Harper Collins 2010), 67.\n2Jason Ryan, 'CIA Director Leon Panetta Warns of Possible Cyber-Pearl Harbor', ABC News, 10 February 2011, https://abcnews.go.com/News/cia-director-leon-panetta-warns-cyber-pearl-harbor/story?id=12888905.\n3Ibid.\n#\nC. L. ROSS\ndefenders. $^{4}$  Moreover, the assumptions about the fragility of modern interconnected societies that underpin these themes have largely gone unquestioned despite the fact that similar assumptions about the effects of strategic bombing proved questionable in the Second World War. $^{5}$  Strategic bombing failed to break German or Japanese will and economies proved far more resilient than air-power proponents believed, yet many readily assume that massive cyber-attacks today would succeed where millions of tons of high explosives could not. The question becomes, how have these themes come to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States?\nUnfortunately, little work has been done to understand the historical development of cyber thinking. In fact, literature on the history of cyber operations in general is rather sparse. Fred Kaplan's Dark Territory is perhaps the most well-known work, but as a journalist writing for a popular audience, it does not provide many details regarding its source material. The Atlantic Council's A Fierce Domain, edited by Jason Healey, is the best scholarly work. It provides a general background but its primary focus is several case studies documenting specific cyber events. USCYBERCOM's historian, Michael Warner, has also written a number of useful articles on the history of cyber operations. However, even fewer authors have explored the intellectual and cultural history of cyber thinking. Thomas Rid's Cyber War Will Not Take Place includes historical case studies and makes an argument that cyber operations should not be considered a form of warfare, but he does not fully trace how contemporaries considered them, how those conceptions changed over time, nor what factors influenced those changes. His Rise of the Machines provides a rich history of the ideas and field of cybernetics, which tangentially relates to cyber operations, but it does not examine the idea of cyber operations directly. Sarah White's recent doctoral thesis titled Subcultural Influences on Military Innovation: The Development of U.S. Military Cyber Doctrine comes closest to documenting the progression of thought, but it more specifically explores the influence of service culture and operational experience on military approaches to new technologies.\nYet understanding that historical development is vitally important. Charting the history of conceptions about cyber operations provides critical insights into how the current images of cyber rose to such prominence in the American psyche. The ideas were not self-evident but instead were formed and framed by several cultural, social, political, and military factors and events. Understanding the evolution of those conceptions is also no mere\n4Jason Healey, 'A Brief History of US Cyber Conflict', in Jason Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain (Washington DC: Cyber Conflict Studies Association 2013), 17.\n5For a great historical study of the conceptual development of strategic bombing and the impact those conceptions had in the employment of bombers in World War II, see Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press 2004).\nintellectual exercise -- ideas influence action, policy, and strategy, and incorrect ideas can lead to disastrous results. Moreover, knowing the assumptions and reasoning that underpinned the early development of strategic thinking can facilitate more thoughtful policy and strategy in the future. Outlining the flow of ideas from previous generations enables leaders and policymakers to better assess their own assumptions and reasoning as they wrestle with current and future challenges.\nIn examining the historical development of American strategic thought regarding cyber operations, three major themes influenced how cyber was conceived leading up to the creation of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009. First, initial cyber capability development in the United States occurred in the context of strategic operations. The primary targets for initial cyber operations, the impact they sought to produce, and the problems they tried to solve all centred around nuclear operations or strategic leadership decision-making. Second, the increasing interconnectivity of critical data and infrastructure meant that cyber operations could theoretically have massive impacts on the economy and national security. Early advocates regularly focused on these doomsday possibilities in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage. Finally, early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives regarding nuclear war and high-profile terrorism. The potential impact and low barrier of entry of cyber operations made it easy for senior leaders to associate cyber with those strategic narratives. These three threads emerge as the most formative themes in the development of conceptions about cyber, and they led senior leaders to view cyber capabilities as strategic weapons capable of impacts on par with weapons of mass destruction.\n## A note on definitions\nProviding clear and unified definitions for cyber and cyberspace is a recurring struggle and theme of the history of military cyber efforts. Definitions for terms like cyberspace, cyber operations, information warfare, command and control warfare, and others have evolved throughout time. As such, it is difficult to use terms consistently throughout the article, particularly because there was significant overlap between the various terms and they were used almost synonymously during certain periods of time. However, the intent is to understand how cyberspace and cyber operations came to be understood as they are today.\nSince 2008, joint doctrine has defined cyberspace as ‘A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet,\n#\nC. L.

Essentially, they refer to operations that disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, along with operations taken to prevent others from doing the same. When military members talk of using 'cyber' to disrupt an integrated air defence system, suggest that the next war will begin with 'cyber', or talk of a 'cyber' officer, they are typically referring to cyber as a distinct military capability that includes using a computer system to achieve some effect on another computer system or its information, while also trying to prevent the same from occurring on one's own systems. It is in that sense that I use the terms cyber and cyber operations.\n# Cyber precursors\nDisrupting an adversary's communications, information warfare, and using the electromagnetic spectrum to achieve objectives are not new phenomena. However, the march towards the modern version of conflict within cyberspace began because of two trends in the latter half of the  $21^{\\text{st}}$  century. First, the exponential growth of electrical computing technology and its proliferation within the security apparatus increasingly presented the possibility of exploitation by adversaries. Second, the movement towards storing and transporting wealth and secrets in digital data, along with the growth of strategic systems reliant on computers and networking, produced growing motivation for adversaries to take advantage of those possibilities. Together, these trends gradually produced and elevated cyber-related issues as concerns for national security.\nAlmost from the very beginning of the digital revolution, analysts identified inherent security issues with the explosion of digital technology in the\n^{6}\nUnited States Air Force, Air Force Doctrine Publications 3-12 - Cyberspace Operations (Washington DC 2023), 6, https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/AFDP_3-12/3-12-AFDP-CYBERSPACE-OPS.pdf.\n^{7}\nDepartment of Defense, United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms (Washington DC: Department of Defense 2019), 233.\n8Michael Warner, 'A Brief History of Cyber Conflict', in Schneider et al.

Thomas Rona, a Boeing advisor to the Secretary of Defense's Office of Net Assessment, wrote a paper in 1976 titled 'Weapon Systems and Information War' that wrestled with the challenges introduced by the information age. He noted that the growing complexity of weapon systems meant that they were increasingly dependent upon external information sources for successful engagements, whether it be intelligence, targeting information, or command and control orders.[9] That dependency created the possibility that weapon systems could be defeated through information denial. Of course, these changes produced both opportunities and vulnerabilities – information warfare could cut both ways. The United States needed to consider how to attack an adversary's information flow as well as how it would protect its own.[10] While his report focused on information warfare predominantly as a means to defeat weapon systems, Rona recognized that there were broader implications and opportunities for strategic warfare.[11]\nWhile Rona looked at information warfare broadly applied to weapons, others focused more specifically on the threat to command and control. As computers became more integrated with the control and employment of force, military members increasingly regarded them as critical assets that required defending as well as potential targets that could be exploited. A 1976 Defense Science Board study on conventional force counters to a Warsaw Pact attack highlighted how disruption of Soviet troop control systems could serve as a critical counterbalance to their numerical superiority.[12] As American awareness subsequently grew regarding Soviet reliance on a tightly controlled and automated system for directing their forces, the military increasingly viewed attacks on the Soviet command and control structure as vital force multipliers. Consequently, the Department of Defense (DoD) began developing a set of doctrinal ideas eventually known as command-and-control warfare (C2W) in 1979 in an effort to negate the numerical advantage of Soviet forces. C2W concepts became highly intertwined with those of information warfare over the next two decades, and both served as the cocoon within which military conceptions of cyber operations initially developed.\nThe increasing digitization also produced greater overlap with signals intelligence techniques. While traditional communications collection relied on intercepting analog signals transmitted on telephone lines or broadcast over the air, digital signals required more robust processing to break out the data and information. The National Security Agency (NSA) and signals\nIt's Col Evan H. Parrott, 'C3CM: Theory, Application, and Process', Research Report, February (Maxwell Air Force Base: Air War College 1983), 14.\nintelligence organizations in the military were on the front lines of this new frontier since they led the effort to discover and collect adversary command and control information. Thus, they were also optimally positioned to be able to manipulate that information or the systems they resided within.\nAs signals intelligence produced greater access into Soviet systems, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought to operationalize them in 1982 through a little-known organization called the Joint Special Studies Group. According to Bruce Berkowitz, the purpose of JSSG was to ‘determine whether vulnerabilities identified from critical node analysis, such as message intercepts, jamming, and signals injection into adversary networks, could be turned into a military or intelligence capability'. The goal was to find ways to affect their automated command and control network or to sow doubts about the integrity of the information in the minds of Soviet leaders. By 1984 though, policymakers, including President Ronald Reagan, began to get concerned about the ability to control the effects of information warfare techniques, especially since they were directed toward strategic Soviet systems and could create considerable problems if they went awry. In the end, while the JSSG was able to model Soviet nuclear communication networks, they never discovered a silver bullet to guarantee disruption of communications, and the program was shut down in 1989 with the end of the Cold War. However, their concepts served as major forerunners to Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA).\nJust as the Joint Chiefs were standing up the JSSG, elements within pop culture began to use hacking-related themes that impacted national security in surprising ways. The 1983 film WarGames starring Matthew Broderick initiated several governmental actions regarding computer security and created enduring conceptions of the cyber threat. The movie details a teenage hacker who almost starts a global nuclear war when he accidentally hacks into a supercomputer at NORAD. In June of 1983, Reagan watched the film while on retreat at Camp David and he proceeded to discuss the plot with members of Congress as well as his national security staff. According to journalist Fred Kaplan, Reagan's inquiries into whether the film's plot could play out in real life led him to discover that the threat of computer intrusion was even worse than he imagined. The subsequent string of events ultimately led to the confidential National Security Decision Directive 145 (NSDD-\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\n145), titled National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security. $^{19}$  It served as the first time that presidential policy addressed what would later become aspects of cyber operations and it originated over concerns about cyber actions leading to nuclear conflict.\nThe President was not the only one concerned about the feasibility of the plot – American media organizations anxiously questioned governmental officials about it following the release of the film. The three major television networks ran a flurry of reports about computer and networking technology using WarGames as a framework for understanding their inherent dangers. Also, much of the reporting discussed it in the context of nuclear war.[20] A four-minute clip from the movie was shown at the opening of congressional hearings on computer security and representatives referenced the film throughout the hearings to help members conceptualize the threat.[21] Ultimately, those hearings led to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984.[22] Not only did the film enable both Presidential and Congressional action, but the movie also popularized the impression that hacking was the realm of anti-establishment teenagers and a potential weapon for global destruction.[23] Those conceptions provided a powerful framing effect for subsequent cyber events.\n# The Morris worm and Desert Storm\nOnly a couple of years later, a real-world event both resonated with and evolved those conceptions. In November 1988, Robert T. Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell graduate student, released a worm onto the NSFNet, a precursor to the internet, from a remotely-accessed computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[24] The worm did not cause any damage to systems or data but within a manner of hours it had infected up to  $10\\%$  of the network.[25] Its replication and spread clogged the processing power of computers to the point of crashing many of the systems.

While many researchers understood that networks and computers were vulnerable, the speed with which the virus spread across such extensive networks gave them a queasy feeling that they had experienced a close call.[26] A few simple alterations would have enabled the worm to destroy massive amounts of data or compromise large portions of sensitive research and defence information.[27] The ease and rapidity of its spread led pundits and officials to begin to ask about the vulnerability of other computer networks that business and infrastructure increasingly depended on. If a single individual could achieve such widespread effects, what could an individual do if they targeted systems associated with national security?\nUnsurprisingly, the event helped reinforce the early image of the malicious individual as the primary threat in cyberspace. While numerous news articles noted that the worm served as a giant wake-up call, the threat was commonly framed as one from hackers and terrorists as opposed to nation states or militaries.[28] That image was fortified by Dutch teenagers hacking into 34 American military installation networks between 1990–91, and young British hackers accessing networks at the Air Force's Rome Labs before routing through to a South Korean nuclear institute in 1994.[29] Policymakers increasingly worried about the impact well-resourced and determined individuals could have if teenagers were able to access such a wide swath of computers. Computer security expert Winn Schwartau did little to abate those fears when he testified in congress in 1991 that governmental and commercial systems were essentially defenceless and an 'electronic Pearl Harbor' was waiting to happen.[30] As early as the late 1980s, conceptions about cyber threats as primarily coming from malignant individuals and capable of devastating impact were already front and centre in the national dialogue about cyber.\nJust as Morris was going to trial, President George H. W. Bush ordered the bombardment of Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In a manner of weeks, the United States defeated a battle-hardened\n26Peter J.

The coalition paralyzed Iraq's command and control infrastructure in the first hours of the attack, leaving Hussein and senior leaders blind, deaf, dumb, and deceived. $^{31}$  The Iraqi disorder was juxtaposed against the highly networked and synchronized United States military. Many American defence experts concluded that the resulting information differential proved critical to the subsequent speed and ease with which America and its allies routed Iraqi forces. $^{32}$  As a result, the victory shoved thinking about information warfare into overdrive among the defence community. As military thinkers sought to understand the roots of the success in order to replicate it in the future, many concluded that information warfare was the secret weapon for quick and decisive victories going forward.\nThe DoD quickly directed the services to organize and train for information warfare in then-classified DoD Directive 3600.1 (DODD TS-3600.1), titled Information Warfare and released in December 1992. It served as the first indication that elements of modern-day cyber were entering the official policy of the military. The Department formally defined information warfare as\nthe competition of opposing information systems to include the exploitation, corruption, or destruction of an adversary's information systems through such means as signals intelligence and command and control countermeasures while protecting the integrity of one's own information systems from such attacks. The objective of information warfare is to attain a significant enough information advantage to enable the force overall to predominate and to do so quickly.[33]\nThe directive essentially tied together many of the related concepts the military had been experimenting with in the previous two decades. It combined the signals-intelligence-enabled precursors to cyber operations, which the military created to counter Soviet nuclear command and control, with the broader C2W ideas developed prior to and then used in Desert Storm. And it was all with the intent of replicating the speed and success of the Gulf War in future conflicts. While the directive served as the introduction of information warfare into defence policy, it was only the beginning, as the post-war period spawned a flurry of ideas and thinking about information warfare from which cyber would later emerge.\n31 Alan D.

ROSS\nThe sense of change and evolution presented by the digital revolution and Desert Storm was only magnified by the unexpected end of the Cold War. The pacing threat for the previous four decades suddenly disappeared and America found itself the lone superpower on the world stage.[34] The vacuum created by the dissolution of the USSR was quickly filled by a focus on high-profile terrorism. As the Soviet empire collapsed, the threat of Soviet nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue nations became a palpable fear for national leadership. The rise of high-profile terrorism as the most pressing security issue of the new century had a direct effect on the development of strategic thinking about cyberspace for the next two decades.\n# Terrorism and cyber Pearl Harbors\nPresident William Clinton's administration became the first to systematically deal with the issue of terrorism as it faced several terrorist attacks in the first years of his presidency.[35] However, it was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that proved most impactful on the president and for cyber operations. The bombing moved him personally, and it led him to wonder about the threat terrorists could pose to more strategic or symbolic locations throughout the country.[36] Through a number of subsequent events, he eventually appointed a Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (later known as the Marsh Commission after its lead, John Marsh) to investigate the vulnerability of important facilities to terrorist attacks.\nThe release of the commission's final report in October of 1997 surprised many by focusing primarily on cyber threats as opposed to traditional physical attacks. The commission noted that all critical infrastructure was dependent on unsecure information technology.[37] While the commission did not find evidence of impending cyber-attacks, it did discover widespread capabilities to exploit infrastructure vulnerabilities. Further, because the commission was created primarily to consider terrorist threats, it largely described the threat from cyber as coming from terrorists and criminals vice nation-state actors.[38] The report never explicitly compared cyber to nuclear weapons but, as with much of the contemporaneous literature, cyber threats were mentioned in the same context as terrorists using weapons of mass destruction.\n34George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 (Oxford UK: Oxford University Press 2011), 920.\n35Ibid., 936.\n36Clarke, Cyber War, 106.\n37Critical infrastructure examined in the report included transportation, oil and gas, water, emergency services, government services, banking and finance, electrical power, and telecommunications. See Robert T. Marsh, 'Critical Foundations: Protecting America's Infrastructures', The Report of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 13 October (Washington DC: 1997), 3-4.\n38Ibid., i.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nWhile the possibility of chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists adds a new and frightening dimension to physical attacks, such weapons are difficult to acquire. In contrast ... a personal computer and a telephone connection to an Internet Service Provider anywhere in the world are enough to cause harm'.39 In reality, the cyber threat from terrorists would largely prove non-existent over the next twenty-five years.40 However, the report's focus on the devastation that a cyber-attack could cause to highly-vulnerable critical infrastructure, and its concentration on terrorists as the primary threat actors, further solidified conceptions of cyber-attacks as catastrophic surprise attacks that were launched by malignant individuals.\nThe urgent tone of the report was underscored by several prominent events that occurred within a couple of years of its release. In June 1997, the JCS launched a no-notice exercise known as ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 97 to test the cyber defences of DoD networks and critical infrastructure. The exercise was the brainchild of NSA Director Lt Gen Kenneth Minihan, who was frustrated at how little the DoD accounted for the threats or opportunities cyber presented in his previous years leading Air Force cyber operations.[41] Thirty-five NSA red-team hackers split into two teams—one in the United States and one on a ship in the Pacific. Armed with no inside information, and using only store-bought computers and hacking tools downloaded from the internet, they proceeded to run rampant through networks leaving marker files to prove where they had been.[42] According to Kaplan's interviews, the portion of the exercise devoted to national infrastructure attacks was a tabletop exercise without real-world intrusions. However, the attackers were actually allowed to penetrate defence networks for the other portion. In doing so, they were able to access the National Military Command Center, send false emails, reformat hard drives, alter communications, shut down phone lines, and sow doubt into command and control – much of what C2W and information warfare had envisioned throughout the preceding decade.[43] John Campbell, the Major General in charge of information operations on the Joint Staff, put it bluntly when he said, ‘... frankly it scared the hell out of a lot of folks because the implications of what this team had been able to do were pretty far-reaching’.[44] DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that it had ‘succeeded beyond its planner’s wildest dreams in elevating the awareness of threats to our computer systems’.[45] It shocked DoD Deputy\n39Ibid., x.\n40While terrorists have relied heavily on the internet for recruiting, communications, and fundraising, there have been no major cyber-attacks or intrusions from terrorists; see Healey, Fierce Domain, 64.\n41Kaplan, Dark Territory, 64.\n42Healey, Fierce Domain, 42.\n43Kaplan, Dark Territory, 69-70.\n44John Campbell, 'Lessons from Our Cyber Past, The First Military Cyber Units', in Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain, 56.\n45Warner, 'Cybersecurity', 797.\n#\nC. L. ROSS\nSecretary and previous sceptic John Hamre, who later said that it showed 'This country is wide open to attack electronically ... We didn't really let them take down the power system in the country, but we made them prove they knew how to do it'.46 ELIGIBLE RECEIVER provided a vivid example to policymakers of what the Marsh Commission had discussed only in hypotheticals, and it magnified the threat of information warfare to senior leaders on the Joint Staff.\nWhile the DoD was still processing the lessons learned from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, the Department experienced a series of intrusions in February 1998 dubbed SOLAR SUNRISE that sparked fears of the beginning of a real-world cyber war. Hamre, with the previous exercise fresh on his mind, notified the President early in the intrusions and said that the incident 'might be the first shots of a genuine cyber war, perhaps by Iraq'.[47] At the time, tensions were particularly high over Iraq's lack of cooperation with United Nations inspectors regarding its weapons of mass destruction program. Several intrusions were traced to the Middle East, leading many to believe Iraqi involvement. It proved to be an embarrassing example of the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace, as it turned out to be the work of California teenagers aided by an Israeli mentor.[48] Hamre later called it 'the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date', and it emotionally underlined leaders' previous fears from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER and the Marsh Commission, even though it ultimately had little impact.[49]\nIt was in the environment of these prominent events that the Pearl Harbor analogy gained significant steam as officials tried to grow awareness of cyber threats. In the events that led to the Marsh Commission, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified to Congress, 'There is a present threat ... We have not yet had a terrorist cyber-attack on the infrastructure. But I think that that is just a matter of time. We do not need to wait for the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor before we wake up to the threat and take steps to confront it'.[50] Senator Sam Nunn, who led the Congressional hearings, later said that the two most significant dangers America faced were terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons and a cyber Pearl Harbor.[51] In other hearings,\n46John J.

In a late 1998 press conference, he commented that ‘The threat of an electronic Pearl Harbor or the threat of cyber-terrorism . . . is clearly one that’s getting increasing attention in this building and throughout the government’.53\nDespite the chorus of predictions about cyber doomsday, some cautioned against the comparison. They noted that an attacker would need significant knowledge of the operating systems, hardware, and networks, as well as the interaction between all of those components, to create the systemic effects that experts warned about. The primary threat for that level of attack would more likely arise from a dedicated team of professionals employed by a nation-state. Thus, an attack would likely take place in a specific geopolitical context rather than being a bolt out of the blue.54 Nevertheless, the analogy became very popular and continued to gain steam over the next twenty years in sounding the alarm over cyber threats.\n## Increasing cyber awareness\nThe inclusion of cyber threats in the National Security Strategies (NSS) during this period further reflected the government’s growing acceptance of the role of cyber in security issues. The 1997 NSS was the first to allude to cyber when it commented on technology making transnational threats more potent than before.55 It also included the first NSS comment – albeit a minor one – on the need to protect critical infrastructure from intrusion.56 The next NSS in 1999 indicated how much cyber thought advanced from the events of the intervening years. Defending critical infrastructure from paralyzing attacks was added to the list of vital national interests, alongside protecting the nation’s territory, citizens, allies, and economic well-being.57 In the large portions devoted to infrastructure, it focused heavily on the threats from cyberspace. As with other documents of the era, cyber-attacks were included in the list of technology advancements, along with weapons of mass destruction, that enabled terrorists or rogue nations to pose a greater risk than before. However, the awareness of cyber threats did not solely apply to\n52 David Perera, ‘Stop Saying “Cyber Pearl Harbor”’, *Fierce Government IT*, 13 June 2012, https://web.archive.org/web/20120617204335/http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/stop-saying-cyber-pearl-harbor/2012-06-13.\n53 Ibid.\n54 George Smith, ‘An Electronic Pearl Harbor?

L. ROSS\ninfrastructure. The 1999 NSS was also the first to discuss the importance of information superiority to military readiness and command and control.[58]\nThe inclusion of information superiority in the NSS was a manifestation of the DoD's growing concern about information warfare throughout the period. The ongoing defence dialogue on information warfare adapted to and folded in many of the same insights and ideas that the Marsh Commission, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, and the SOLAR SUNRISE intrusions identified. Other internal studies and exercises only added to the concerns. Recognizing that the growth of cyberspace would profoundly impact national security, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a series of exercises on information warfare in 1996 to help develop a national information warfare strategy.[59] Their report identified that much of national infrastructure (what the Marsh Commission would later include in critical infrastructure) was connected to the internet and attacks on such would take on a strategic aspect. Thus, they framed the challenge as 'strategic information warfare'.[60] The more their participants became aware of information warfare's possibilities in the exercises, the more fearful they became of the impacts it could have. Only a couple of months later, the General Accounting Office warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the problems plaguing the civilian internet were increasingly threatening DoD information systems. They reported that 'The potential for catastrophic damage is great. Organized foreign nationals or terrorists could use \"information warfare\" techniques to disrupt military operations by harming command and control systems, the public switch network, and other systems or networks Defense relies on'.[61] Further, a report from the Defense Science Board Task Force on Information Warfare Defense in November of 1996 stated that cyberspace threats to infrastructure created 'a tunnel of vulnerability previously unrealized in the history of conflict'.[62] The possibilities of information warfare became increasingly dire the more military leaders considered it.\nThe arrival of the new century brought more high-profile cyber issues and they too were accompanied by a continual chorus of fears about cyber destruction. The year 2000 itself created significant concern in the computer community over the potential impacts it would have on how computers\n58Ibid., 12.\n59Roger C. Molander, Andrew S. Riddle and Peter A.

There was widespread concern at the time that power, transportation, banking, and other critical systems would fail at midnight and cause the extensive panic envisioned in the cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios. Several internet worms also garnered significant attention around the same time. ILOVEYOU, Melissa, Code Red, NIMDA, SQL Slammer, and others captured headlines and the awareness of Americans. In February of 2000, a 16-year-old Canadian used a program downloaded off the internet to conduct a distributed-denial-of-service attack against Amazon, CNN, eBay, Yahoo, and others. Not only did it make headlines for simultaneously hitting several big companies, but it led President Clinton to organize the first White House roundtable on cybersecurity. While these public hacks drew a lot of press, none of them was deeply impactful, nor did they directly influence national security issues outside of elevating the prominence of cyber within the national conscious writ large. The most concerning thing about them was the constant drumbeat of articles warning that more dangerous attacks were imminent and that it was only a matter of time before cyber-terrorists brought the nation to its knees.\nA major cyber-espionage case in early 2001 actually did have a significant impact on the DoD, though its effects came in the form of information compromise. A series of intrusions dubbed MOONLIGHT MAZE launched a high-profile, multi-year investigation and provided the first indication of a changing threat environment. The details are still classified but the incursions appeared to have begun in March 1998 and affected hundreds of computers at NASA, the Pentagon, other governmental agencies, private universities, and research labs. SOLAR SUNRISE was a scare, but this event became truly worrying for policymakers. They appeared to be the first major intrusions conducted by a nation-state, they lasted for several years with disturbingly few clues about who was behind them or what they were taking, and the government could not seem to stop them. Evidence suggested Russian actors targeting unclassified sensitive technical research matters, but the sparse details caused discomfort. Two years after the discovery, James Adams, a member of NSA's advisory board, characterized the attack to the Washington Post as ‘the most persistent and serious computer attack against\n#\nC. L. ROSS\nthe United States to date'. He also stated that attacks continued unabated and had triggered the 'largest cyber-intelligence investigation ever'. Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre, ever on the lookout for a cyber conflict, allegedly told congressional colleagues, 'We're in the middle of a cyberwar'.\nUnfortunately, everything in the national security apparatus turned upside down when the fears about a massive terrorist attack against critical American facilities became reality on 11 September of that year. While it neither came via cyber means nor did it cripple America, it did drastically revector the nation's defence as it absorbed the shock of the attacks and gradually funnelled its response into the Global War on Terror. In a continuation of the trends of the previous half-decade, news articles in the weeks following the attacks continued to warn that cyberspace would likely provide the vector for the next big strike. The shock of September  $11^{\\text{th}}$  further cemented a fear of massive surprise attacks from unknown dark forces in the American psyche.\n# Cyber authorities and the first cyber strategies\nAs the United States began both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the concepts for cyber operations as a distinct military capability began to solidify and mature, enabling further development of authorities and strategies for operating in cyberspace. While cyber was increasingly talked about as something distinct from information warfare, the two were still deeply intertwined and often used interchangeably into the 2000s. That began to change in official policy in late 1996 but it took several years for the distinction to fully materialize. In then-classified DoD Directive S-3600.1, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White rechristened information warfare to information operations and, for the first time in official documents, defined computer network attack. However, as cyber gradually emerged from information warfare as a distinct capability, its development and maturation were directly influenced by the conceptions formed over the previous two decades.\nThe Bush Administration's attempts to provide increased clarity on authorities for cyber operations in the run-up to the war shed light on American leadership's conceptions of cyber at that point in time. The Washington Post reported that Bush signed the classified National Security Presidential Directive 16 (NSPD-16) in July of 2002 to provide the first national-level guidance on when and how the United States would launch cyber-attacks against an adversary.[73] Predictably, the article likened the development to\n71Vernon Loeb, 'NSA Adviser Says Cyber-Assaults On Pentagon Persist With Few Clues', The Washington Post, 7 May 2001, https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nsa-adviser-says-cyber-assaults-on-pentagon/docview/409117447/se-2?accountid=4332.\n72We're in the Middle of a Cyberwar', Newsweek, 19 September 1999.\n73Bradley Graham, 'Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare', The Washington Post, 7 February 2003, https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-pr04/readings/week5/bush_guidelines..\nthe formulation of guidelines in the early days of nuclear weapons. However, the article also discussed how the administration and the DoD were still wrestling with some of the aspects of cyber conflict and whether it should be unleashed. According to the article, part of the hesitation to launch attacks stemmed from America's vulnerability to cyber and concerns about establishing a norm that could be used against the United States. Richard Clarke, who had recently resigned from his post as Special Advisor to the President on Cybersecurity, highlighted another concern when he said, ‘There also is an issue, frankly, that's similar to the strategic nuclear issue which is: Do you ever want to do it? Do you want to legitimize that kind of weaponry?' The article insightfully concluded by saying, ‘Given the newness of the weapons, their potential power and the uncertainty about how they would work, the Pentagon's Joint Staff has issued classified “rules of engagement” that strictly require top-level approval for any cyber-attack'.\nThe DoD's then-classified Information Operations Roadmap, released in October of 2003, provided additional insights into the insider discussions regarding cyber authorities as well as military conceptions of cyber operations. The roadmap maintained five components for information operations but it replaced physical destruction with Computer Network Operations (CNO). It also included several recommendations devoted to CNA and Computer Network Defence (CND). One notable recommendation was that United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM, the parent command for cyber operations at the time) classify CNA capabilities into more refined categories that could allow for differentiated levels of authority to use them. The roadmap proposed three categories of weapons: those that could be allocated to a combatant commander, those pre-allocated to support aspects of specified operational or contingency plans, and those that were not assigned to combatant commanders and therefore required Secretary or Presidential approval. Not only was it remarkable as the first attempt to distinguish between levels of cyber weapons, rather than merely thinking of cyber as a single capability, but it also demonstrated that the authority to use cyber-attack techniques would still be restricted to very high-levels. It highlighted how, even with a more refined understanding of cyber weaponization, there was still a significant reticence to use them.\nThe advancement of cyber operations as a distinct military element itself accelerated in the years that followed. After the 2004 National Military Strategy declared cyberspace a warfighting domain for the first time, the\n#\nC. L. ROSS\nJCS released the first-ever military strategy for cyber operations in 2006. The then-classified National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations presented a far more nuanced and robust understanding of the domain than previous unclassified doctrine or policy statements. It provided an updated definition for cyberspace along with a list of domain characteristics and key features that drove the strategy's development.[78] The only strategic end that has been declassified was the first one, which sought to deter adversaries 'from establishing or employing offensive capabilities against US interests in cyberspace'.[79] It is unclear if 'establishing' referred to preventing the development of cyber capabilities. If so, it would have been a lofty goal to say the least, as the low barrier to entry made it virtually impossible to stop. However, it would have mirrored concepts of nuclear non-proliferation, which seek to prevent nations from even developing nuclear weapons in the first place due to their destructive power. In pursuing deterrence by imposing costs, denying benefits, and 'inducing adversary restraint based on demonstrated US capabilities', the strategy ultimately echoed elements within existing nuclear deterrence theory.[80]\nAlthough defence and national security leadership matured their ideas and strategy concerning cyberspace in the early years of the Global War on Terror, it did not become a major personal focus for President George W. Bush until the end of his time in office. However, that changed with a meeting in April 2007. It appears that President Bush approved a covert action request within the first five minutes of what was supposed to be an hour-long meeting.[81] Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), took advantage of the newly-available fifty-five minutes to talk to the president about McConnell's concerns for national cyber defence – a major topic of anxiety for him. McConnell would later talk about cyber threats, specifically an attack against the financial industry or critical infrastructure, as one of the primary threats that kept him up at night.[82] His inclusion of cyber as a new weapon of mass destruction alongside nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the same interview clearly demonstrated how he thought about the threat from cyber operations.[83] McConnell used the time with\n78Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Military Strategy of Cyberspace Operations, December 2006. This document is now partially declassified. https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/21419-document-23\n79Ibid., 13.\n80Ibid.\n81Details about the meeting's content come primarily from secondary sources. In Playing to the Edge, Hayden provided the only primary source material when he specifically credited DNI McConnell with selling Bush on the 'immediacy of the cyber threat and convinced him to launch the CNCI', 177. Kaplan's Dark Territory includes a more in-depth telling of events based on his interviews of unknown members, 174-178. Clarke's Cyber War provides fewer details than Kaplan but they largely agree with Kaplan's narrative, 114.\n82Mike McConnell, interview by Charlie Rose, The Charlie Rose Show, PBS, 8 January 2009. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Speeches%20and%20Interviews/20090108_interview.pdf\n83Ibid.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nthe President to highlight many of the previous decade's findings about America's vulnerability to cyber-attacks as well as its potential for strategic impact on national security. To punctuate his point to Bush, McConnell purportedly told the president that if Al Qaeda had been smarter, they would have launched a cyber-attack against a major bank in New York City and corrupted the files, which would have caused more economic damage than the attack on the Twin Towers.[84]\nThe discussion apparently lit a fire under the president and he directed McConnell to quickly produce a solution.[85] When McConnell later told the president that the plan would be expensive, Bush allegedly said that he was willing to spend as much as had been spent on the Manhattan Project to work towards solutions.[86] The result was the then-classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative as outlined in NSPD-54 Cybersecurity Policy. The initiative sought to improve the defence of government systems as well as those critical to national security, national economic security, or public health and safety.[87] While the funding details are not clear, it was reported to include tens of billions of dollars, which demonstrated the administration's level of concern over the issue.[88] The initiative was rebranded by the incoming Obama administration but largely kept the same structure. The growing conceptions regarding both the threats and opportunities of cyber operations eventually led Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to approve the stand-up of a combatant command dedicated to the domain of cyberspace the following year.[89]\n# Conclusion\nThe historical development of cyber within the United States leading up to the creation of USCYBERCOM demonstrates several recurring themes that shaped national and defence leaders' conceptions about cyber operations. The first theme is that cyber operations were birthed in strategic applications. They were first introduced to disrupt and defeat Soviet nuclear forces and their command and control. Those concepts were later applied against Iraqi leadership in Desert Storm with smashing success. The desire to replicate such a definitive victory in future conflicts spawned two subsequent decades\n84Kaplan, Dark Territory, 174.\n85Kaplan's Dark Territory records Bush saying he wanted a solution in thirty days, 175, while Clarke's Cyber War quoted him saying, 'I want a plan, soon, real soon', 114.\n86Kaplan, Dark Territory, 178.\n87National Security Presidential Directive, 54, Cybersecurity Policy, 8 January 2008, 4. https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-54.pdf. This document is now partially declassified.\n88Kaplan's Dark Territory reported the administration requested $18B over five years, 178. Clarke's Cyber War pegged the number at $50B over five years. Others reported $3.6B alone allocated to it in 2011, see Eric Chabrow, 'CNCI Budget Request Set at $3.6 Billion', GovInfoSecurity, 2 February 2010, https://www.govinfosecurity.com/cnci-budget-request-set-at-36-billion-a-2151.\n89Robert Gates, Duty (New York City NY: Alfred A. Knopf 2014), 193-4.\nof evolving thought over how to quickly win wars by using information and computers to cripple adversary leadership and their strategic systems.\nThe second theme is that leaders increasingly feared the potential of a cyber attack against critical infrastructure. The growing interconnectivity of vital data, networks, and infrastructure meant that those elements were becoming progressively more vulnerable to cyber threats. The strategic nature of those targets meant that cyber operations could theoretically have strategic impacts on critical societal and warfighting functions, which dominated senior leaders' thinking about the threat. Early advocates regularly used the doomsday possibility of a ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage.\nThe final theme is that early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives concentrated on nuclear war and high-profile terrorism, and it became easily interwoven with both. Computers and the internet were exciting and novel technologies to the majority of Americans during the early days of cyber, including senior leaders, but few understood much about how either computers or the internet worked. However, they were regularly told that a teenager with a computer bought at RadioShack could now cause disruption on the scale of nuclear weapons. Additionally, most of the cyber-attacks they read about in the news came from mischievous individuals as bolts out of the blue. Cyber operations were thus easily linked in the minds of senior leaders to the leading security issues of the times -- nuclear weapons and high-profile terrorism.\nUntil further information is declassified regarding cyber operations that occurred during the time period, it will be impossible to fully assess how much the rhetoric matched reality. Still, the context within which strategic thought develops influences the direction that it will go. Although obvious when stated, it is a truism that strategists and leaders neglect at their own peril. The context surrounding the development of thought regarding cyberspace in America affected the frameworks, authorities, and operations that leaders applied to the domain, potentially to the benefit and detriment of national security. Fears of a cyber Pearl Harbor enabled advocates to garner attention and resources for cyber issues. However, the focus on catastrophic attacks led to an underappreciation of how a campaign of individually inconsequential events can shape geopolitical contexts towards favourable ends. Early intrusions by computer-savvy teenagers highlighted the insecure nature of networks and facilitated the initial development of cybersecurity. Yet they also created unrealistic expectations in leaders about how easy it would be for future cyber operators to create on-order effects against hard targets. Describing cyber-attacks as moving at the speed of light and capable of reaching anywhere\nin the networked world helped leaders to understand the potential of cyber operations. But it also downplayed the intense time and work required to locate a desired network, gain access, understand the environment, and then develop capabilities to achieve specific and predictable effects. The true impact or validity of these conceptions can only be fully determined once more information becomes available. However, they serve as a reminder to leaders about the need to continuously examine the assumptions and reasoning from which they are operating -- always seeking to validate or disprove them -- to ensure that their cognitive frameworks best reflect reality as it is.\n## Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank C.

Ross Schriever Space Scholars, Air Command and Staff College, Montgomery, AL, USA # ABSTRACT Futurist depictions of cyber-attacks in coming wars often portray them as bolts out of the blue that will cause immense damage to a nation's warfighting capacity and create chaos among its populace by crippling its essential services. However, those depictions are based more on prophecy than they are on historical realities. The historical development of conceptions about cyber operations explains how those themes came to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States. Rather than being self-evident, the themes are a result of the application of early cyber efforts to strategic operations, advocacy that focused on doomsday scenarios to draw attention to cybersecurity problems, and the ease with which cyber threats were tied to the primary strategic narratives of American national security during their development.\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 September 2022; Accepted 18 November 2023 KEYWORDS Cyber; Pearl Harbor; cybersecurity; information warfare; information operations; cyberspace; future war # Introduction In his 2011 book Cyber War, Richard Clarke, the former Special Advisor to the President for Cybersecurity, outlined a fictional depiction of a full-scale cyber war in America. His scenario began with the White House Situation Room receiving a message from the National Security Agency (NSA) about multiple malware targeting critical infrastructure before the desk officer subsequently becomes bombarded with messages about systems failing across the country. Department of Defense networks go offline, gas refineries explode in multiple major cities, chemical plants leak poisonous gas into the environment, aeroplanes collide in mid-air after air traffic control centres lose their air picture, and rail traffic ceased due to trains and subways derailing at key junction points.

Americans panic and looting ensues as a result of the breakdown of essential services in the days that follow, which completely overwhelms the police and emergency services. He concluded by saying that 'A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country'.\nWhile notable for the exceedingly grim nature of his prediction, it is largely consistent with the chorus of prognostications regarding the impact that cyber operations will play in the future. As Andy Greenberg at Wired puts it, 'The threat of cyberwar looms over the future: a new dimension of conflict capable of leapfrogging borders and teleporting the chaos of war to civilians thousands of miles beyond its front'. Fiction literature about the future of war is riddled with these themes. Ghost Fleet, a novel by political scientist and futurist P. W. Singer, details a Chinese surprise attack against the United States that largely succeeds due to crippling cyber-attacks against American weapon systems and infrastructure. Similarly, Admiral James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman's novel 2034 includes cyber-attacks that cause national power blackouts and government computer lockouts, while also disabling fighter aircraft and naval vessels across the globe. The themes are not unique to fictional stories though – indeed, the authors included those elements in the plotlines precisely because they capture the fears of policymakers in the real world. Testifying before Congress in 2011, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta talked about how the next Pearl Harbor-type attack likely could come from a cyber-attack. 'If you have a cyber-attack that brings down our power-grid system, brings down our financial system, brings down our government systems, you could paralyze this country... And I think that's a real potential'. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, echoed the sentiment and said that the threat from cyber operations 'is increasing in scope and scale, and its impact is difficult to overstate'.\nInterestingly, these images of cyber operations seem to be grounded in prophesy rather than historical realities. While cyber has become associated with the image of a catastrophic surprise attack, the history of cyber-attacks has been dominated by the less dramatic elements of espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Likewise, the strategic state conflicts that have included cyber elements did not include surprise cyber-attacks. Instead, they took place in larger geopolitical conflicts that offered ample warning time for 1Richard A. Clarke, Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It (New York, NY: Harper Collins 2010), 67.\n2Jason Ryan, 'CIA Director Leon Panetta Warns of Possible Cyber-Pearl Harbor', ABC News, 10 February 2011, https://abcnews.go.com/News/cia-director-leon-panetta-warns-cyber-pearl-harbor/story?id=12888905.\n3Ibid.\n# C. L. ROSS defenders. Moreover, the assumptions about the fragility of modern interconnected societies that underpin these themes have largely gone unquestioned despite the fact that similar assumptions about the effects of strategic bombing proved questionable in the Second World War. Strategic bombing failed to break German or Japanese will and economies proved far more resilient than air-power proponents believed, yet many readily assume that massive cyber-attacks today would succeed where millions of tons of high explosives could not. The question becomes, how have these themes come to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States?\nUnfortunately, little work has been done to understand the historical development of cyber thinking. In fact, literature on the history of cyber operations in general is rather sparse. Fred Kaplan's Dark Territory is perhaps the most well-known work, but as a journalist writing for a popular audience, it does not provide many details regarding its source material. The Atlantic Council's A Fierce Domain, edited by Jason Healey, is the best scholarly work. It provides a general background but its primary focus is several case studies documenting specific cyber events. USCYBERCOM's historian, Michael Warner, has also written a number of useful articles on the history of cyber operations. However, even fewer authors have explored the intellectual and cultural history of cyber thinking. Thomas Rid's Cyber War Will Not Take Place includes historical case studies and makes an argument that cyber operations should not be considered a form of warfare, but he does not fully trace how contemporaries considered them, how those conceptions changed over time, nor what factors influenced those changes. His Rise of the Machines provides a rich history of the ideas and field of cybernetics, which tangentially relates to cyber operations, but it does not examine the idea of cyber operations directly. Sarah White's recent doctoral thesis titled Subcultural Influences on Military Innovation: The Development of U.S. Military Cyber Doctrine comes closest to documenting the progression of thought, but it more specifically explores the influence of service culture and operational experience on military approaches to new technologies.\nYet understanding that historical development is vitally important. Charting the history of conceptions about cyber operations provides critical insights into how the current images of cyber rose to such prominence in the American psyche. The ideas were not self-evident but instead were formed and framed by several cultural, social, political, and military factors and events. Understanding the evolution of those conceptions is also no mere 4Jason Healey, 'A Brief History of US Cyber Conflict', in Jason Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain (Washington DC: Cyber Conflict Studies Association 2013), 17.\n5For a great historical study of the conceptual development of strategic bombing and the impact those conceptions had in the employment of bombers in World War II, see Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press 2004).\nintellectual exercise -- ideas influence action, policy, and strategy, and incorrect ideas can lead to disastrous results. Moreover, knowing the assumptions and reasoning that underpinned the early development of strategic thinking can facilitate more thoughtful policy and strategy in the future. Outlining the flow of ideas from previous generations enables leaders and policymakers to better assess their own assumptions and reasoning as they wrestle with current and future challenges.\nIn examining the historical development of American strategic thought regarding cyber operations, three major themes influenced how cyber was conceived leading up to the creation of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009. First, initial cyber capability development in the United States occurred in the context of strategic operations. The primary targets for initial cyber operations, the impact they sought to produce, and the problems they tried to solve all centred around nuclear operations or strategic leadership decision-making. Second, the increasing interconnectivity of critical data and infrastructure meant that cyber operations could theoretically have massive impacts on the economy and national security. Early advocates regularly focused on these doomsday possibilities in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage. Finally, early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives regarding nuclear war and high-profile terrorism. The potential impact and low barrier of entry of cyber operations made it easy for senior leaders to associate cyber with those strategic narratives. These three threads emerge as the most formative themes in the development of conceptions about cyber, and they led senior leaders to view cyber capabilities as strategic weapons capable of impacts on par with weapons of mass destruction.\n## A note on definitions Providing clear and unified definitions for cyber and cyberspace is a recurring struggle and theme of the history of military cyber efforts. Definitions for terms like cyberspace, cyber operations, information warfare, command and control warfare, and others have evolved throughout time. As such, it is difficult to use terms consistently throughout the article, particularly because there was significant overlap between the various terms and they were used almost synonymously during certain periods of time. However, the intent is to understand how cyberspace and cyber operations came to be understood as they are today.\nSince 2008, joint doctrine has defined cyberspace as ‘A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, # C.

ROSS telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'.6 Thus, cyber operations are plainly defined as 'The employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace'.7 While individuals, organizations, and military services have emphasized particular aspects in their use of the term cyber (for example the networks, the information, the electromagnetic spectrum, etc.), I intend the terms 'cyber' and 'cyber operations' to synonymously capture the imprecise ideas that American national security professionals commonly mean when they discuss the terms today, which broadly centre around concepts of computer hacking. Essentially, they refer to operations that disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, along with operations taken to prevent others from doing the same. When military members talk of using 'cyber' to disrupt an integrated air defence system, suggest that the next war will begin with 'cyber', or talk of a 'cyber' officer, they are typically referring to cyber as a distinct military capability that includes using a computer system to achieve some effect on another computer system or its information, while also trying to prevent the same from occurring on one's own systems. It is in that sense that I use the terms cyber and cyber operations.\n# Cyber precursors Disrupting an adversary's communications, information warfare, and using the electromagnetic spectrum to achieve objectives are not new phenomena. However, the march towards the modern version of conflict within cyberspace began because of two trends in the latter half of the $21^{\\text{st}}$ century. First, the exponential growth of electrical computing technology and its proliferation within the security apparatus increasingly presented the possibility of exploitation by adversaries. Second, the movement towards storing and transporting wealth and secrets in digital data, along with the growth of strategic systems reliant on computers and networking, produced growing motivation for adversaries to take advantage of those possibilities. Together, these trends gradually produced and elevated cyber-related issues as concerns for national security.\nAlmost from the very beginning of the digital revolution, analysts identified inherent security issues with the explosion of digital technology in the United States Air Force, Air Force Doctrine Publications 3-12 - Cyberspace Operations (Washington DC 2023), 6, https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/AFDP_3-12/3-12-AFDP-CYBERSPACE-OPS.pdf.\n\nDepartment of Defense, United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms (Washington DC: Department of Defense 2019), 233.\n8Michael Warner, 'A Brief History of Cyber Conflict', in Schneider et al.

Thomas Rona, a Boeing advisor to the Secretary of Defense's Office of Net Assessment, wrote a paper in 1976 titled 'Weapon Systems and Information War' that wrestled with the challenges introduced by the information age. He noted that the growing complexity of weapon systems meant that they were increasingly dependent upon external information sources for successful engagements, whether it be intelligence, targeting information, or command and control orders.[9] That dependency created the possibility that weapon systems could be defeated through information denial. Of course, these changes produced both opportunities and vulnerabilities – information warfare could cut both ways. The United States needed to consider how to attack an adversary's information flow as well as how it would protect its own.[10] While his report focused on information warfare predominantly as a means to defeat weapon systems, Rona recognized that there were broader implications and opportunities for strategic warfare.[11] While Rona looked at information warfare broadly applied to weapons, others focused more specifically on the threat to command and control. As computers became more integrated with the control and employment of force, military members increasingly regarded them as critical assets that required defending as well as potential targets that could be exploited. A 1976 Defense Science Board study on conventional force counters to a Warsaw Pact attack highlighted how disruption of Soviet troop control systems could serve as a critical counterbalance to their numerical superiority.[12] As American awareness subsequently grew regarding Soviet reliance on a tightly controlled and automated system for directing their forces, the military increasingly viewed attacks on the Soviet command and control structure as vital force multipliers. Consequently, the Department of Defense (DoD) began developing a set of doctrinal ideas eventually known as command-and-control warfare (C2W) in 1979 in an effort to negate the numerical advantage of Soviet forces. C2W concepts became highly intertwined with those of information warfare over the next two decades, and both served as the cocoon within which military conceptions of cyber operations initially developed.\nThe increasing digitization also produced greater overlap with signals intelligence techniques. While traditional communications collection relied on intercepting analog signals transmitted on telephone lines or broadcast over the air, digital signals required more robust processing to break out the data and information. The National Security Agency (NSA) and signals It's Col Evan H. Parrott, 'C3CM: Theory, Application, and Process', Research Report, February (Maxwell Air Force Base: Air War College 1983), 14.\nintelligence organizations in the military were on the front lines of this new frontier since they led the effort to discover and collect adversary command and control information. Thus, they were also optimally positioned to be able to manipulate that information or the systems they resided within.\nAs signals intelligence produced greater access into Soviet systems, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought to operationalize them in 1982 through a little-known organization called the Joint Special Studies Group. According to Bruce Berkowitz, the purpose of JSSG was to ‘determine whether vulnerabilities identified from critical node analysis, such as message intercepts, jamming, and signals injection into adversary networks, could be turned into a military or intelligence capability'. The goal was to find ways to affect their automated command and control network or to sow doubts about the integrity of the information in the minds of Soviet leaders. By 1984 though, policymakers, including President Ronald Reagan, began to get concerned about the ability to control the effects of information warfare techniques, especially since they were directed toward strategic Soviet systems and could create considerable problems if they went awry. In the end, while the JSSG was able to model Soviet nuclear communication networks, they never discovered a silver bullet to guarantee disruption of communications, and the program was shut down in 1989 with the end of the Cold War. However, their concepts served as major forerunners to Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA).\nJust as the Joint Chiefs were standing up the JSSG, elements within pop culture began to use hacking-related themes that impacted national security in surprising ways. The 1983 film WarGames starring Matthew Broderick initiated several governmental actions regarding computer security and created enduring conceptions of the cyber threat. The movie details a teenage hacker who almost starts a global nuclear war when he accidentally hacks into a supercomputer at NORAD. In June of 1983, Reagan watched the film while on retreat at Camp David and he proceeded to discuss the plot with members of Congress as well as his national security staff. According to journalist Fred Kaplan, Reagan's inquiries into whether the film's plot could play out in real life led him to discover that the threat of computer intrusion was even worse than he imagined. The subsequent string of events ultimately led to the confidential National Security Decision Directive 145 (NSDD- THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # 145), titled National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security. It served as the first time that presidential policy addressed what would later become aspects of cyber operations and it originated over concerns about cyber actions leading to nuclear conflict.\nThe President was not the only one concerned about the feasibility of the plot – American media organizations anxiously questioned governmental officials about it following the release of the film. The three major television networks ran a flurry of reports about computer and networking technology using WarGames as a framework for understanding their inherent dangers. Also, much of the reporting discussed it in the context of nuclear war.[20] A four-minute clip from the movie was shown at the opening of congressional hearings on computer security and representatives referenced the film throughout the hearings to help members conceptualize the threat.[21] Ultimately, those hearings led to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984.[22] Not only did the film enable both Presidential and Congressional action, but the movie also popularized the impression that hacking was the realm of anti-establishment teenagers and a potential weapon for global destruction.[23] Those conceptions provided a powerful framing effect for subsequent cyber events.\n# The Morris worm and Desert Storm Only a couple of years later, a real-world event both resonated with and evolved those conceptions. In November 1988, Robert T. Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell graduate student, released a worm onto the NSFNet, a precursor to the internet, from a remotely-accessed computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[24] The worm did not cause any damage to systems or data but within a manner of hours it had infected up to $10\\%$ of the network.[25] Its replication and spread clogged the processing power of computers to the point of crashing many of the systems.

L. ROSS convey the impact that the Morris worm had on the psyche of both the computer community and the nation writ large. While many researchers understood that networks and computers were vulnerable, the speed with which the virus spread across such extensive networks gave them a queasy feeling that they had experienced a close call.[26] A few simple alterations would have enabled the worm to destroy massive amounts of data or compromise large portions of sensitive research and defence information.[27] The ease and rapidity of its spread led pundits and officials to begin to ask about the vulnerability of other computer networks that business and infrastructure increasingly depended on. If a single individual could achieve such widespread effects, what could an individual do if they targeted systems associated with national security?\nUnsurprisingly, the event helped reinforce the early image of the malicious individual as the primary threat in cyberspace. While numerous news articles noted that the worm served as a giant wake-up call, the threat was commonly framed as one from hackers and terrorists as opposed to nation states or militaries.[28] That image was fortified by Dutch teenagers hacking into 34 American military installation networks between 1990–91, and young British hackers accessing networks at the Air Force's Rome Labs before routing through to a South Korean nuclear institute in 1994.[29] Policymakers increasingly worried about the impact well-resourced and determined individuals could have if teenagers were able to access such a wide swath of computers. Computer security expert Winn Schwartau did little to abate those fears when he testified in congress in 1991 that governmental and commercial systems were essentially defenceless and an 'electronic Pearl Harbor' was waiting to happen.[30] As early as the late 1980s, conceptions about cyber threats as primarily coming from malignant individuals and capable of devastating impact were already front and centre in the national dialogue about cyber.\nJust as Morris was going to trial, President George H. W. Bush ordered the bombardment of Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In a manner of weeks, the United States defeated a battle-hardened 26Peter J. Denning, 'The Science of Computing: The Internet Worm', American Scientist 77/2 (March–April 1989), 127.\n27Assistant Comptroller General, Computer Security, 4.\n28Most often they are subtle references but suggest that many viewed the threat as being one from malevolently motivated individuals. This is a representative example from a Wall St. Journal article: 'If computers can be sabotaged so easily, so swiftly, experts wonder, how vulnerable is the system to high-tech terrorists?'

The coalition paralyzed Iraq's command and control infrastructure in the first hours of the attack, leaving Hussein and senior leaders blind, deaf, dumb, and deceived. The Iraqi disorder was juxtaposed against the highly networked and synchronized United States military. Many American defence experts concluded that the resulting information differential proved critical to the subsequent speed and ease with which America and its allies routed Iraqi forces. As a result, the victory shoved thinking about information warfare into overdrive among the defence community. As military thinkers sought to understand the roots of the success in order to replicate it in the future, many concluded that information warfare was the secret weapon for quick and decisive victories going forward.\nThe DoD quickly directed the services to organize and train for information warfare in then-classified DoD Directive 3600.1 (DODD TS-3600.1), titled Information Warfare and released in December 1992. It served as the first indication that elements of modern-day cyber were entering the official policy of the military. The Department formally defined information warfare as the competition of opposing information systems to include the exploitation, corruption, or destruction of an adversary's information systems through such means as signals intelligence and command and control countermeasures while protecting the integrity of one's own information systems from such attacks. The objective of information warfare is to attain a significant enough information advantage to enable the force overall to predominate and to do so quickly.[33] The directive essentially tied together many of the related concepts the military had been experimenting with in the previous two decades. It combined the signals-intelligence-enabled precursors to cyber operations, which the military created to counter Soviet nuclear command and control, with the broader C2W ideas developed prior to and then used in Desert Storm. And it was all with the intent of replicating the speed and success of the Gulf War in future conflicts. While the directive served as the introduction of information warfare into defence policy, it was only the beginning, as the post-war period spawned a flurry of ideas and thinking about information warfare from which cyber would later emerge.\n\n# C. L. ROSS The sense of change and evolution presented by the digital revolution and Desert Storm was only magnified by the unexpected end of the Cold War. The pacing threat for the previous four decades suddenly disappeared and America found itself the lone superpower on the world stage.[34] The vacuum created by the dissolution of the USSR was quickly filled by a focus on high-profile terrorism. As the Soviet empire collapsed, the threat of Soviet nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue nations became a palpable fear for national leadership. The rise of high-profile terrorism as the most pressing security issue of the new century had a direct effect on the development of strategic thinking about cyberspace for the next two decades.\n# Terrorism and cyber Pearl Harbors President William Clinton's administration became the first to systematically deal with the issue of terrorism as it faced several terrorist attacks in the first years of his presidency.[35] However, it was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that proved most impactful on the president and for cyber operations. The bombing moved him personally, and it led him to wonder about the threat terrorists could pose to more strategic or symbolic locations throughout the country.[36] Through a number of subsequent events, he eventually appointed a Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (later known as the Marsh Commission after its lead, John Marsh) to investigate the vulnerability of important facilities to terrorist attacks.\nThe release of the commission's final report in October of 1997 surprised many by focusing primarily on cyber threats as opposed to traditional physical attacks. The commission noted that all critical infrastructure was dependent on unsecure information technology.[37] While the commission did not find evidence of impending cyber-attacks, it did discover widespread capabilities to exploit infrastructure vulnerabilities. Further, because the commission was created primarily to consider terrorist threats, it largely described the threat from cyber as coming from terrorists and criminals vice nation-state actors.[38] The report never explicitly compared cyber to nuclear weapons but, as with much of the contemporaneous literature, cyber threats were mentioned in the same context as terrorists using weapons of mass destruction.\n34George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 (Oxford UK: Oxford University Press 2011), 920.\n35Ibid., 936.\n36Clarke, Cyber War, 106.\n37Critical infrastructure examined in the report included transportation, oil and gas, water, emergency services, government services, banking and finance, electrical power, and telecommunications. See Robert T. Marsh, 'Critical Foundations: Protecting America's Infrastructures', The Report of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 13 October (Washington DC: 1997), 3-4.\n38Ibid., i.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # While the possibility of chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists adds a new and frightening dimension to physical attacks, such weapons are difficult to acquire. In contrast... a personal computer and a telephone connection to an Internet Service Provider anywhere in the world are enough to cause harm'.39 In reality, the cyber threat from terrorists would largely prove non-existent over the next twenty-five years.40 However, the report's focus on the devastation that a cyber-attack could cause to highly-vulnerable critical infrastructure, and its concentration on terrorists as the primary threat actors, further solidified conceptions of cyber-attacks as catastrophic surprise attacks that were launched by malignant individuals.\nThe urgent tone of the report was underscored by several prominent events that occurred within a couple of years of its release. In June 1997, the JCS launched a no-notice exercise known as ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 97 to test the cyber defences of DoD networks and critical infrastructure. The exercise was the brainchild of NSA Director Lt Gen Kenneth Minihan, who was frustrated at how little the DoD accounted for the threats or opportunities cyber presented in his previous years leading Air Force cyber operations.[41] Thirty-five NSA red-team hackers split into two teams—one in the United States and one on a ship in the Pacific. Armed with no inside information, and using only store-bought computers and hacking tools downloaded from the internet, they proceeded to run rampant through networks leaving marker files to prove where they had been.[42] According to Kaplan's interviews, the portion of the exercise devoted to national infrastructure attacks was a tabletop exercise without real-world intrusions. However, the attackers were actually allowed to penetrate defence networks for the other portion. In doing so, they were able to access the National Military Command Center, send false emails, reformat hard drives, alter communications, shut down phone lines, and sow doubt into command and control – much of what C2W and information warfare had envisioned throughout the preceding decade.[43] John Campbell, the Major General in charge of information operations on the Joint Staff, put it bluntly when he said, ‘... frankly it scared the hell out of a lot of folks because the implications of what this team had been able to do were pretty far-reaching’.[44] DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that it had ‘succeeded beyond its planner’s wildest dreams in elevating the awareness of threats to our computer systems’.[45] It shocked DoD Deputy 39Ibid., x.\n40While terrorists have relied heavily on the internet for recruiting, communications, and fundraising, there have been no major cyber-attacks or intrusions from terrorists; see Healey, Fierce Domain, 64.\n41Kaplan, Dark Territory, 64.\n42Healey, Fierce Domain, 42.\n43Kaplan, Dark Territory, 69-70.\n44John Campbell, 'Lessons from Our Cyber Past, The First Military Cyber Units', in Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain, 56.\n45Warner, 'Cybersecurity', 797.\n# C. L. ROSS Secretary and previous sceptic John Hamre, who later said that it showed 'This country is wide open to attack electronically... We didn't really let them take down the power system in the country, but we made them prove they knew how to do it'.46 ELIGIBLE RECEIVER provided a vivid example to policymakers of what the Marsh Commission had discussed only in hypotheticals, and it magnified the threat of information warfare to senior leaders on the Joint Staff.\nWhile the DoD was still processing the lessons learned from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, the Department experienced a series of intrusions in February 1998 dubbed SOLAR SUNRISE that sparked fears of the beginning of a real-world cyber war. Hamre, with the previous exercise fresh on his mind, notified the President early in the intrusions and said that the incident 'might be the first shots of a genuine cyber war, perhaps by Iraq'.[47] At the time, tensions were particularly high over Iraq's lack of cooperation with United Nations inspectors regarding its weapons of mass destruction program. Several intrusions were traced to the Middle East, leading many to believe Iraqi involvement. It proved to be an embarrassing example of the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace, as it turned out to be the work of California teenagers aided by an Israeli mentor.[48] Hamre later called it 'the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date', and it emotionally underlined leaders' previous fears from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER and the Marsh Commission, even though it ultimately had little impact.[49] It was in the environment of these prominent events that the Pearl Harbor analogy gained significant steam as officials tried to grow awareness of cyber threats. In the events that led to the Marsh Commission, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified to Congress, 'There is a present threat... We have not yet had a terrorist cyber-attack on the infrastructure. But I think that that is just a matter of time. We do not need to wait for the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor before we wake up to the threat and take steps to confront it'.[50] Senator Sam Nunn, who led the Congressional hearings, later said that the two most significant dangers America faced were terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons and a cyber Pearl Harbor.[51] In other hearings, 46John J. Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense, speech to the Fortune 500 CIO Forum, Aspen, Colorado, 21 July 1998 https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell//library/news/1998/07/t08121998_t072198.\n47Healey, Fierce Domain, 43.\n\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nDespite the chorus of predictions about cyber doomsday, some cautioned against the comparison. They noted that an attacker would need significant knowledge of the operating systems, hardware, and networks, as well as the interaction between all of those components, to create the systemic effects that experts warned about. The primary threat for that level of attack would more likely arise from a dedicated team of professionals employed by a nation-state. Thus, an attack would likely take place in a specific geopolitical context rather than being a bolt out of the blue.54 Nevertheless, the analogy became very popular and continued to gain steam over the next twenty years in sounding the alarm over cyber threats.\n## Increasing cyber awareness The inclusion of cyber threats in the National Security Strategies (NSS) during this period further reflected the government’s growing acceptance of the role of cyber in security issues. The 1997 NSS was the first to allude to cyber when it commented on technology making transnational threats more potent than before.55 It also included the first NSS comment – albeit a minor one – on the need to protect critical infrastructure from intrusion.56 The next NSS in 1999 indicated how much cyber thought advanced from the events of the intervening years. Defending critical infrastructure from paralyzing attacks was added to the list of vital national interests, alongside protecting the nation’s territory, citizens, allies, and economic well-being.57 In the large portions devoted to infrastructure, it focused heavily on the threats from cyberspace. As with other documents of the era, cyber-attacks were included in the list of technology advancements, along with weapons of mass destruction, that enabled terrorists or rogue nations to pose a greater risk than before. However, the awareness of cyber threats did not solely apply to\n\n# C. L. ROSS infrastructure. The 1999 NSS was also the first to discuss the importance of information superiority to military readiness and command and control.[58] The inclusion of information superiority in the NSS was a manifestation of the DoD's growing concern about information warfare throughout the period. The ongoing defence dialogue on information warfare adapted to and folded in many of the same insights and ideas that the Marsh Commission, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, and the SOLAR SUNRISE intrusions identified. Other internal studies and exercises only added to the concerns. Recognizing that the growth of cyberspace would profoundly impact national security, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a series of exercises on information warfare in 1996 to help develop a national information warfare strategy.[59] Their report identified that much of national infrastructure (what the Marsh Commission would later include in critical infrastructure) was connected to the internet and attacks on such would take on a strategic aspect. Thus, they framed the challenge as 'strategic information warfare'.[60] The more their participants became aware of information warfare's possibilities in the exercises, the more fearful they became of the impacts it could have. Only a couple of months later, the General Accounting Office warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the problems plaguing the civilian internet were increasingly threatening DoD information systems. They reported that 'The potential for catastrophic damage is great. Organized foreign nationals or terrorists could use\"information warfare\"techniques to disrupt military operations by harming command and control systems, the public switch network, and other systems or networks Defense relies on'.[61] Further, a report from the Defense Science Board Task Force on Information Warfare Defense in November of 1996 stated that cyberspace threats to infrastructure created 'a tunnel of vulnerability previously unrealized in the history of conflict'.[62] The possibilities of information warfare became increasingly dire the more military leaders considered it.\nThe arrival of the new century brought more high-profile cyber issues and they too were accompanied by a continual chorus of fears about cyber destruction. The year 2000 itself created significant concern in the computer community over the potential impacts it would have on how computers 58Ibid., 12.\n59Roger C. Molander, Andrew S. Riddle and Peter A.

There was widespread concern at the time that power, transportation, banking, and other critical systems would fail at midnight and cause the extensive panic envisioned in the cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios. Several internet worms also garnered significant attention around the same time. ILOVEYOU, Melissa, Code Red, NIMDA, SQL Slammer, and others captured headlines and the awareness of Americans. In February of 2000, a 16-year-old Canadian used a program downloaded off the internet to conduct a distributed-denial-of-service attack against Amazon, CNN, eBay, Yahoo, and others. Not only did it make headlines for simultaneously hitting several big companies, but it led President Clinton to organize the first White House roundtable on cybersecurity. While these public hacks drew a lot of press, none of them was deeply impactful, nor did they directly influence national security issues outside of elevating the prominence of cyber within the national conscious writ large. The most concerning thing about them was the constant drumbeat of articles warning that more dangerous attacks were imminent and that it was only a matter of time before cyber-terrorists brought the nation to its knees.\nA major cyber-espionage case in early 2001 actually did have a significant impact on the DoD, though its effects came in the form of information compromise. A series of intrusions dubbed MOONLIGHT MAZE launched a high-profile, multi-year investigation and provided the first indication of a changing threat environment. The details are still classified but the incursions appeared to have begun in March 1998 and affected hundreds of computers at NASA, the Pentagon, other governmental agencies, private universities, and research labs. SOLAR SUNRISE was a scare, but this event became truly worrying for policymakers. They appeared to be the first major intrusions conducted by a nation-state, they lasted for several years with disturbingly few clues about who was behind them or what they were taking, and the government could not seem to stop them. Evidence suggested Russian actors targeting unclassified sensitive technical research matters, but the sparse details caused discomfort. Two years after the discovery, James Adams, a member of NSA's advisory board, characterized the attack to the Washington Post as ‘the most persistent and serious computer attack against # C. L. ROSS the United States to date'. He also stated that attacks continued unabated and had triggered the 'largest cyber-intelligence investigation ever'. Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre, ever on the lookout for a cyber conflict, allegedly told congressional colleagues, 'We're in the middle of a cyberwar'.\nUnfortunately, everything in the national security apparatus turned upside down when the fears about a massive terrorist attack against critical American facilities became reality on 11 September of that year. While it neither came via cyber means nor did it cripple America, it did drastically revector the nation's defence as it absorbed the shock of the attacks and gradually funnelled its response into the Global War on Terror. In a continuation of the trends of the previous half-decade, news articles in the weeks following the attacks continued to warn that cyberspace would likely provide the vector for the next big strike. The shock of September $11^{\\text{th}}$ further cemented a fear of massive surprise attacks from unknown dark forces in the American psyche.\n# Cyber authorities and the first cyber strategies As the United States began both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the concepts for cyber operations as a distinct military capability began to solidify and mature, enabling further development of authorities and strategies for operating in cyberspace. While cyber was increasingly talked about as something distinct from information warfare, the two were still deeply intertwined and often used interchangeably into the 2000s. That began to change in official policy in late 1996 but it took several years for the distinction to fully materialize. In then-classified DoD Directive S-3600.1, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White rechristened information warfare to information operations and, for the first time in official documents, defined computer network attack. However, as cyber gradually emerged from information warfare as a distinct capability, its development and maturation were directly influenced by the conceptions formed over the previous two decades.\nThe Bush Administration's attempts to provide increased clarity on authorities for cyber operations in the run-up to the war shed light on American leadership's conceptions of cyber at that point in time. The Washington Post reported that Bush signed the classified National Security Presidential Directive 16 (NSPD-16) in July of 2002 to provide the first national-level guidance on when and how the United States would launch cyber-attacks against an adversary.[73] Predictably, the article likened the development to 71Vernon Loeb, 'NSA Adviser Says Cyber-Assaults On Pentagon Persist With Few Clues', The Washington Post, 7 May 2001, https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nsa-adviser-says-cyber-assaults-on-pentagon/docview/409117447/se-2?accountid=4332.\n72We're in the Middle of a Cyberwar', Newsweek, 19 September 1999.\n73Bradley Graham, 'Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare', The Washington Post, 7 February 2003, https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-pr04/readings/week5/bush_guidelines..\nthe formulation of guidelines in the early days of nuclear weapons. However, the article also discussed how the administration and the DoD were still wrestling with some of the aspects of cyber conflict and whether it should be unleashed. According to the article, part of the hesitation to launch attacks stemmed from America's vulnerability to cyber and concerns about establishing a norm that could be used against the United States. Richard Clarke, who had recently resigned from his post as Special Advisor to the President on Cybersecurity, highlighted another concern when he said, ‘There also is an issue, frankly, that's similar to the strategic nuclear issue which is: Do you ever want to do it? Do you want to legitimize that kind of weaponry?' The article insightfully concluded by saying, ‘Given the newness of the weapons, their potential power and the uncertainty about how they would work, the Pentagon's Joint Staff has issued classified “rules of engagement” that strictly require top-level approval for any cyber-attack'.\nThe DoD's then-classified Information Operations Roadmap, released in October of 2003, provided additional insights into the insider discussions regarding cyber authorities as well as military conceptions of cyber operations. The roadmap maintained five components for information operations but it replaced physical destruction with Computer Network Operations (CNO). It also included several recommendations devoted to CNA and Computer Network Defence (CND). One notable recommendation was that United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM, the parent command for cyber operations at the time) classify CNA capabilities into more refined categories that could allow for differentiated levels of authority to use them. The roadmap proposed three categories of weapons: those that could be allocated to a combatant commander, those pre-allocated to support aspects of specified operational or contingency plans, and those that were not assigned to combatant commanders and therefore required Secretary or Presidential approval. Not only was it remarkable as the first attempt to distinguish between levels of cyber weapons, rather than merely thinking of cyber as a single capability, but it also demonstrated that the authority to use cyber-attack techniques would still be restricted to very high-levels. It highlighted how, even with a more refined understanding of cyber weaponization, there was still a significant reticence to use them.\nThe advancement of cyber operations as a distinct military element itself accelerated in the years that followed. After the 2004 National Military Strategy declared cyberspace a warfighting domain for the first time, the # C. L. ROSS JCS released the first-ever military strategy for cyber operations in 2006. The then-classified National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations presented a far more nuanced and robust understanding of the domain than previous unclassified doctrine or policy statements. It provided an updated definition for cyberspace along with a list of domain characteristics and key features that drove the strategy's development.[78] The only strategic end that has been declassified was the first one, which sought to deter adversaries 'from establishing or employing offensive capabilities against US interests in cyberspace'.[79] It is unclear if 'establishing' referred to preventing the development of cyber capabilities. If so, it would have been a lofty goal to say the least, as the low barrier to entry made it virtually impossible to stop. However, it would have mirrored concepts of nuclear non-proliferation, which seek to prevent nations from even developing nuclear weapons in the first place due to their destructive power. In pursuing deterrence by imposing costs, denying benefits, and 'inducing adversary restraint based on demonstrated US capabilities', the strategy ultimately echoed elements within existing nuclear deterrence theory.[80] Although defence and national security leadership matured their ideas and strategy concerning cyberspace in the early years of the Global War on Terror, it did not become a major personal focus for President George W. Bush until the end of his time in office. However, that changed with a meeting in April 2007. It appears that President Bush approved a covert action request within the first five minutes of what was supposed to be an hour-long meeting.[81] Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), took advantage of the newly-available fifty-five minutes to talk to the president about McConnell's concerns for national cyber defence – a major topic of anxiety for him. McConnell would later talk about cyber threats, specifically an attack against the financial industry or critical infrastructure, as one of the primary threats that kept him up at night.[82] His inclusion of cyber as a new weapon of mass destruction alongside nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the same interview clearly demonstrated how he thought about the threat from cyber operations.[83] McConnell used the time with 78Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Military Strategy of Cyberspace Operations, December 2006. This document is now partially declassified. https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/21419-document-23 79Ibid., 13.\n80Ibid.\n81Details about the meeting's content come primarily from secondary sources. In Playing to the Edge, Hayden provided the only primary source material when he specifically credited DNI McConnell with selling Bush on the 'immediacy of the cyber threat and convinced him to launch the CNCI', 177. Kaplan's Dark Territory includes a more in-depth telling of events based on his interviews of unknown members, 174-178. Clarke's Cyber War provides fewer details than Kaplan but they largely agree with Kaplan's narrative, 114.\n82Mike McConnell, interview by Charlie Rose, The Charlie Rose Show, PBS, 8 January 2009. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Speeches%20and%20Interviews/20090108_interview.pdf 83Ibid.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # the President to highlight many of the previous decade's findings about America's vulnerability to cyber-attacks as well as its potential for strategic impact on national security. To punctuate his point to Bush, McConnell purportedly told the president that if Al Qaeda had been smarter, they would have launched a cyber-attack against a major bank in New York City and corrupted the files, which would have caused more economic damage than the attack on the Twin Towers.[84] The discussion apparently lit a fire under the president and he directed McConnell to quickly produce a solution.[85] When McConnell later told the president that the plan would be expensive, Bush allegedly said that he was willing to spend as much as had been spent on the Manhattan Project to work towards solutions.[86] The result was the then-classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative as outlined in NSPD-54 Cybersecurity Policy. The initiative sought to improve the defence of government systems as well as those critical to national security, national economic security, or public health and safety.[87] While the funding details are not clear, it was reported to include tens of billions of dollars, which demonstrated the administration's level of concern over the issue.[88] The initiative was rebranded by the incoming Obama administration but largely kept the same structure. The growing conceptions regarding both the threats and opportunities of cyber operations eventually led Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to approve the stand-up of a combatant command dedicated to the domain of cyberspace the following year.[89] # Conclusion The historical development of cyber within the United States leading up to the creation of USCYBERCOM demonstrates several recurring themes that shaped national and defence leaders' conceptions about cyber operations. The first theme is that cyber operations were birthed in strategic applications. They were first introduced to disrupt and defeat Soviet nuclear forces and their command and control. Those concepts were later applied against Iraqi leadership in Desert Storm with smashing success. The desire to replicate such a definitive victory in future conflicts spawned two subsequent decades 84Kaplan, Dark Territory, 174.\n85Kaplan's Dark Territory records Bush saying he wanted a solution in thirty days, 175, while Clarke's Cyber War quoted him saying, 'I want a plan, soon, real soon', 114.\n86Kaplan, Dark Territory, 178.\n87National Security Presidential Directive, 54, Cybersecurity Policy, 8 January 2008, 4. https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-54.pdf.

Others reported $3.6B alone allocated to it in 2011, see Eric Chabrow, 'CNCI Budget Request Set at $3.6 Billion', GovInfoSecurity, 2 February 2010, https://www.govinfosecurity.com/cnci-budget-request-set-at-36-billion-a-2151.\n89Robert Gates, Duty (New York City NY: Alfred A. Knopf 2014), 193-4.\nof evolving thought over how to quickly win wars by using information and computers to cripple adversary leadership and their strategic systems.\nThe second theme is that leaders increasingly feared the potential of a cyber attack against critical infrastructure. The growing interconnectivity of vital data, networks, and infrastructure meant that those elements were becoming progressively more vulnerable to cyber threats. The strategic nature of those targets meant that cyber operations could theoretically have strategic impacts on critical societal and warfighting functions, which dominated senior leaders' thinking about the threat. Early advocates regularly used the doomsday possibility of a ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage.\nThe final theme is that early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives concentrated on nuclear war and high-profile terrorism, and it became easily interwoven with both. Computers and the internet were exciting and novel technologies to the majority of Americans during the early days of cyber, including senior leaders, but few understood much about how either computers or the internet worked. However, they were regularly told that a teenager with a computer bought at RadioShack could now cause disruption on the scale of nuclear weapons. Additionally, most of the cyber-attacks they read about in the news came from mischievous individuals as bolts out of the blue. Cyber operations were thus easily linked in the minds of senior leaders to the leading security issues of the times -- nuclear weapons and high-profile terrorism.\nUntil further information is declassified regarding cyber operations that occurred during the time period, it will be impossible to fully assess how much the rhetoric matched reality. Still, the context within which strategic thought develops influences the direction that it will go. Although obvious when stated, it is a truism that strategists and leaders neglect at their own peril. The context surrounding the development of thought regarding cyberspace in America affected the frameworks, authorities, and operations that leaders applied to the domain, potentially to the benefit and detriment of national security. Fears of a cyber Pearl Harbor enabled advocates to garner attention and resources for cyber issues. However, the focus on catastrophic attacks led to an underappreciation of how a campaign of individually inconsequential events can shape geopolitical contexts towards favourable ends. Early intrusions by computer-savvy teenagers highlighted the insecure nature of networks and facilitated the initial development of cybersecurity. Yet they also created unrealistic expectations in leaders about how easy it would be for future cyber operators to create on-order effects against hard targets. Describing cyber-attacks as moving at the speed of light and capable of reaching anywhere in the networked world helped leaders to understand the potential of cyber operations. But it also downplayed the intense time and work required to locate a desired network, gain access, understand the environment, and then develop capabilities to achieve specific and predictable effects. The true impact or validity of these conceptions can only be fully determined once more information becomes available. However, they serve as a reminder to leaders about the need to continuously examine the assumptions and reasoning from which they are operating -- always seeking to validate or disprove them -- to ensure that their cognitive frameworks best reflect reality as it is.\n## Acknowledgments The author would like to thank C.

Ross Schriever Space Scholars, Air Command and Staff College, Montgomery, AL, USA # ABSTRACT Futurist depictions of cyber-attacks in coming wars often portray them as bolts out of the blue that will cause immense damage to a nation's warfighting capacity and create chaos among its populace by crippling its essential services. However, those depictions are based more on prophecy than they are on historical realities. The historical development of conceptions about cyber operations explains how those themes came to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States. Rather than being self-evident, the themes are a result of the application of early cyber efforts to strategic operations, advocacy that focused on doomsday scenarios to draw attention to cybersecurity problems, and the ease with which cyber threats were tied to the primary strategic narratives of American national security during their development.\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 September 2022; Accepted 18 November 2023 KEYWORDS Cyber; Pearl Harbor; cybersecurity; information warfare; information operations; cyberspace; future war # Introduction In his 2011 book Cyber War, Richard Clarke, the former Special Advisor to the President for Cybersecurity, outlined a fictional depiction of a full-scale cyber war in America. His scenario began with the White House Situation Room receiving a message from the National Security Agency (NSA) about multiple malware targeting critical infrastructure before the desk officer subsequently becomes bombarded with messages about systems failing across the country. Department of Defense networks go offline, gas refineries explode in multiple major cities, chemical plants leak poisonous gas into the environment, aeroplanes collide in mid-air after air traffic control centres lose their air picture, and rail traffic ceased due to trains and subways derailing at key junction points.

Americans panic and looting ensues as a result of the breakdown of essential services in the days that follow, which completely overwhelms the police and emergency services. He concluded by saying that 'A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country'.\nWhile notable for the exceedingly grim nature of his prediction, it is largely consistent with the chorus of prognostications regarding the impact that cyber operations will play in the future. As Andy Greenberg at Wired puts it, 'The threat of cyberwar looms over the future: a new dimension of conflict capable of leapfrogging borders and teleporting the chaos of war to civilians thousands of miles beyond its front'. Fiction literature about the future of war is riddled with these themes. Ghost Fleet, a novel by political scientist and futurist P. W. Singer, details a Chinese surprise attack against the United States that largely succeeds due to crippling cyber-attacks against American weapon systems and infrastructure. Similarly, Admiral James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman's novel 2034 includes cyber-attacks that cause national power blackouts and government computer lockouts, while also disabling fighter aircraft and naval vessels across the globe. The themes are not unique to fictional stories though – indeed, the authors included those elements in the plotlines precisely because they capture the fears of policymakers in the real world. Testifying before Congress in 2011, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta talked about how the next Pearl Harbor-type attack likely could come from a cyber-attack. 'If you have a cyber-attack that brings down our power-grid system, brings down our financial system, brings down our government systems, you could paralyze this country... And I think that's a real potential'. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, echoed the sentiment and said that the threat from cyber operations 'is increasing in scope and scale, and its impact is difficult to overstate'.\nInterestingly, these images of cyber operations seem to be grounded in prophesy rather than historical realities. While cyber has become associated with the image of a catastrophic surprise attack, the history of cyber-attacks has been dominated by the less dramatic elements of espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Likewise, the strategic state conflicts that have included cyber elements did not include surprise cyber-attacks. Instead, they took place in larger geopolitical conflicts that offered ample warning time for 1Richard A. Clarke, Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It (New York, NY: Harper Collins 2010), 67.\n2Jason Ryan, 'CIA Director Leon Panetta Warns of Possible Cyber-Pearl Harbor', ABC News, 10 February 2011, https://abcnews.go.com/News/cia-director-leon-panetta-warns-cyber-pearl-harbor/story?id=12888905.\n3Ibid.\n# C. L. ROSS defenders. Moreover, the assumptions about the fragility of modern interconnected societies that underpin these themes have largely gone unquestioned despite the fact that similar assumptions about the effects of strategic bombing proved questionable in the Second World War. Strategic bombing failed to break German or Japanese will and economies proved far more resilient than air-power proponents believed, yet many readily assume that massive cyber-attacks today would succeed where millions of tons of high explosives could not. The question becomes, how have these themes come to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States?\nUnfortunately, little work has been done to understand the historical development of cyber thinking. In fact, literature on the history of cyber operations in general is rather sparse. Fred Kaplan's Dark Territory is perhaps the most well-known work, but as a journalist writing for a popular audience, it does not provide many details regarding its source material. The Atlantic Council's A Fierce Domain, edited by Jason Healey, is the best scholarly work. It provides a general background but its primary focus is several case studies documenting specific cyber events. USCYBERCOM's historian, Michael Warner, has also written a number of useful articles on the history of cyber operations. However, even fewer authors have explored the intellectual and cultural history of cyber thinking. Thomas Rid's Cyber War Will Not Take Place includes historical case studies and makes an argument that cyber operations should not be considered a form of warfare, but he does not fully trace how contemporaries considered them, how those conceptions changed over time, nor what factors influenced those changes. His Rise of the Machines provides a rich history of the ideas and field of cybernetics, which tangentially relates to cyber operations, but it does not examine the idea of cyber operations directly. Sarah White's recent doctoral thesis titled Subcultural Influences on Military Innovation: The Development of U.S. Military Cyber Doctrine comes closest to documenting the progression of thought, but it more specifically explores the influence of service culture and operational experience on military approaches to new technologies.\nYet understanding that historical development is vitally important. Charting the history of conceptions about cyber operations provides critical insights into how the current images of cyber rose to such prominence in the American psyche. The ideas were not self-evident but instead were formed and framed by several cultural, social, political, and military factors and events. Understanding the evolution of those conceptions is also no mere 4Jason Healey, 'A Brief History of US Cyber Conflict', in Jason Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain (Washington DC: Cyber Conflict Studies Association 2013), 17.\n5For a great historical study of the conceptual development of strategic bombing and the impact those conceptions had in the employment of bombers in World War II, see Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press 2004).\nintellectual exercise -- ideas influence action, policy, and strategy, and incorrect ideas can lead to disastrous results. Moreover, knowing the assumptions and reasoning that underpinned the early development of strategic thinking can facilitate more thoughtful policy and strategy in the future. Outlining the flow of ideas from previous generations enables leaders and policymakers to better assess their own assumptions and reasoning as they wrestle with current and future challenges.\nIn examining the historical development of American strategic thought regarding cyber operations, three major themes influenced how cyber was conceived leading up to the creation of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009. First, initial cyber capability development in the United States occurred in the context of strategic operations. The primary targets for initial cyber operations, the impact they sought to produce, and the problems they tried to solve all centred around nuclear operations or strategic leadership decision-making. Second, the increasing interconnectivity of critical data and infrastructure meant that cyber operations could theoretically have massive impacts on the economy and national security. Early advocates regularly focused on these doomsday possibilities in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage. Finally, early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives regarding nuclear war and high-profile terrorism. The potential impact and low barrier of entry of cyber operations made it easy for senior leaders to associate cyber with those strategic narratives. These three threads emerge as the most formative themes in the development of conceptions about cyber, and they led senior leaders to view cyber capabilities as strategic weapons capable of impacts on par with weapons of mass destruction.\n## A note on definitions Providing clear and unified definitions for cyber and cyberspace is a recurring struggle and theme of the history of military cyber efforts. Definitions for terms like cyberspace, cyber operations, information warfare, command and control warfare, and others have evolved throughout time. As such, it is difficult to use terms consistently throughout the article, particularly because there was significant overlap between the various terms and they were used almost synonymously during certain periods of time. However, the intent is to understand how cyberspace and cyber operations came to be understood as they are today.\nSince 2008, joint doctrine has defined cyberspace as ‘A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, # C. L. ROSS telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'.6 Thus, cyber operations are plainly defined as 'The employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace'.7 While individuals, organizations, and military services have emphasized particular aspects in their use of the term cyber (for example the networks, the information, the electromagnetic spectrum, etc.), I intend the terms 'cyber' and 'cyber operations' to synonymously capture the imprecise ideas that American national security professionals commonly mean when they discuss the terms today, which broadly centre around concepts of computer hacking. Essentially, they refer to operations that disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, along with operations taken to prevent others from doing the same. When military members talk of using 'cyber' to disrupt an integrated air defence system, suggest that the next war will begin with 'cyber', or talk of a 'cyber' officer, they are typically referring to cyber as a distinct military capability that includes using a computer system to achieve some effect on another computer system or its information, while also trying to prevent the same from occurring on one's own systems. It is in that sense that I use the terms cyber and cyber operations.\n# Cyber precursors Disrupting an adversary's communications, information warfare, and using the electromagnetic spectrum to achieve objectives are not new phenomena. However, the march towards the modern version of conflict within cyberspace began because of two trends in the latter half of the $21^{\\text{st}}$ century. First, the exponential growth of electrical computing technology and its proliferation within the security apparatus increasingly presented the possibility of exploitation by adversaries. Second, the movement towards storing and transporting wealth and secrets in digital data, along with the growth of strategic systems reliant on computers and networking, produced growing motivation for adversaries to take advantage of those possibilities. Together, these trends gradually produced and elevated cyber-related issues as concerns for national security.\nAlmost from the very beginning of the digital revolution, analysts identified inherent security issues with the explosion of digital technology in the United States Air Force, Air Force Doctrine Publications 3-12 - Cyberspace Operations (Washington DC 2023), 6, https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/AFDP_3-12/3-12-AFDP-CYBERSPACE-OPS.pdf.\n\nDepartment of Defense, United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms (Washington DC: Department of Defense 2019), 233.\n8Michael Warner, 'A Brief History of Cyber Conflict', in Schneider et al. (ed.), Ten Years In (Newport RI: Naval War College 2020), 15.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # military. Thomas Rona, a Boeing advisor to the Secretary of Defense's Office of Net Assessment, wrote a paper in 1976 titled 'Weapon Systems and Information War' that wrestled with the challenges introduced by the information age. He noted that the growing complexity of weapon systems meant that they were increasingly dependent upon external information sources for successful engagements, whether it be intelligence, targeting information, or command and control orders.[9] That dependency created the possibility that weapon systems could be defeated through information denial. Of course, these changes produced both opportunities and vulnerabilities – information warfare could cut both ways. The United States needed to consider how to attack an adversary's information flow as well as how it would protect its own.[10] While his report focused on information warfare predominantly as a means to defeat weapon systems, Rona recognized that there were broader implications and opportunities for strategic warfare.[11] While Rona looked at information warfare broadly applied to weapons, others focused more specifically on the threat to command and control. As computers became more integrated with the control and employment of force, military members increasingly regarded them as critical assets that required defending as well as potential targets that could be exploited. A 1976 Defense Science Board study on conventional force counters to a Warsaw Pact attack highlighted how disruption of Soviet troop control systems could serve as a critical counterbalance to their numerical superiority.[12] As American awareness subsequently grew regarding Soviet reliance on a tightly controlled and automated system for directing their forces, the military increasingly viewed attacks on the Soviet command and control structure as vital force multipliers. Consequently, the Department of Defense (DoD) began developing a set of doctrinal ideas eventually known as command-and-control warfare (C2W) in 1979 in an effort to negate the numerical advantage of Soviet forces. C2W concepts became highly intertwined with those of information warfare over the next two decades, and both served as the cocoon within which military conceptions of cyber operations initially developed.\nThe increasing digitization also produced greater overlap with signals intelligence techniques. While traditional communications collection relied on intercepting analog signals transmitted on telephone lines or broadcast over the air, digital signals required more robust processing to break out the data and information. The National Security Agency (NSA) and signals It's Col Evan H. Parrott, 'C3CM: Theory, Application, and Process', Research Report, February (Maxwell Air Force Base: Air War College 1983), 14.\nintelligence organizations in the military were on the front lines of this new frontier since they led the effort to discover and collect adversary command and control information. Thus, they were also optimally positioned to be able to manipulate that information or the systems they resided within.\nAs signals intelligence produced greater access into Soviet systems, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought to operationalize them in 1982 through a little-known organization called the Joint Special Studies Group. According to Bruce Berkowitz, the purpose of JSSG was to ‘determine whether vulnerabilities identified from critical node analysis, such as message intercepts, jamming, and signals injection into adversary networks, could be turned into a military or intelligence capability'. The goal was to find ways to affect their automated command and control network or to sow doubts about the integrity of the information in the minds of Soviet leaders. By 1984 though, policymakers, including President Ronald Reagan, began to get concerned about the ability to control the effects of information warfare techniques, especially since they were directed toward strategic Soviet systems and could create considerable problems if they went awry. In the end, while the JSSG was able to model Soviet nuclear communication networks, they never discovered a silver bullet to guarantee disruption of communications, and the program was shut down in 1989 with the end of the Cold War. However, their concepts served as major forerunners to Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA).\nJust as the Joint Chiefs were standing up the JSSG, elements within pop culture began to use hacking-related themes that impacted national security in surprising ways. The 1983 film WarGames starring Matthew Broderick initiated several governmental actions regarding computer security and created enduring conceptions of the cyber threat. The movie details a teenage hacker who almost starts a global nuclear war when he accidentally hacks into a supercomputer at NORAD. In June of 1983, Reagan watched the film while on retreat at Camp David and he proceeded to discuss the plot with members of Congress as well as his national security staff. According to journalist Fred Kaplan, Reagan's inquiries into whether the film's plot could play out in real life led him to discover that the threat of computer intrusion was even worse than he imagined. The subsequent string of events ultimately led to the confidential National Security Decision Directive 145 (NSDD- THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # 145), titled National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security. It served as the first time that presidential policy addressed what would later become aspects of cyber operations and it originated over concerns about cyber actions leading to nuclear conflict.\nThe President was not the only one concerned about the feasibility of the plot – American media organizations anxiously questioned governmental officials about it following the release of the film. The three major television networks ran a flurry of reports about computer and networking technology using WarGames as a framework for understanding their inherent dangers. Also, much of the reporting discussed it in the context of nuclear war.[20] A four-minute clip from the movie was shown at the opening of congressional hearings on computer security and representatives referenced the film throughout the hearings to help members conceptualize the threat.[21] Ultimately, those hearings led to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984.[22] Not only did the film enable both Presidential and Congressional action, but the movie also popularized the impression that hacking was the realm of anti-establishment teenagers and a potential weapon for global destruction.[23] Those conceptions provided a powerful framing effect for subsequent cyber events.\n# The Morris worm and Desert Storm Only a couple of years later, a real-world event both resonated with and evolved those conceptions. In November 1988, Robert T. Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell graduate student, released a worm onto the NSFNet, a precursor to the internet, from a remotely-accessed computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[24] The worm did not cause any damage to systems or data but within a manner of hours it had infected up to $10\\%$ of the network.[25] Its replication and spread clogged the processing power of computers to the point of crashing many of the systems.

L. ROSS convey the impact that the Morris worm had on the psyche of both the computer community and the nation writ large. While many researchers understood that networks and computers were vulnerable, the speed with which the virus spread across such extensive networks gave them a queasy feeling that they had experienced a close call.[26] A few simple alterations would have enabled the worm to destroy massive amounts of data or compromise large portions of sensitive research and defence information.[27] The ease and rapidity of its spread led pundits and officials to begin to ask about the vulnerability of other computer networks that business and infrastructure increasingly depended on. If a single individual could achieve such widespread effects, what could an individual do if they targeted systems associated with national security?\nUnsurprisingly, the event helped reinforce the early image of the malicious individual as the primary threat in cyberspace. While numerous news articles noted that the worm served as a giant wake-up call, the threat was commonly framed as one from hackers and terrorists as opposed to nation states or militaries.[28] That image was fortified by Dutch teenagers hacking into 34 American military installation networks between 1990–91, and young British hackers accessing networks at the Air Force's Rome Labs before routing through to a South Korean nuclear institute in 1994.[29] Policymakers increasingly worried about the impact well-resourced and determined individuals could have if teenagers were able to access such a wide swath of computers. Computer security expert Winn Schwartau did little to abate those fears when he testified in congress in 1991 that governmental and commercial systems were essentially defenceless and an 'electronic Pearl Harbor' was waiting to happen.[30] As early as the late 1980s, conceptions about cyber threats as primarily coming from malignant individuals and capable of devastating impact were already front and centre in the national dialogue about cyber.\nJust as Morris was going to trial, President George H. W. Bush ordered the bombardment of Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In a manner of weeks, the United States defeated a battle-hardened 26Peter J.

The coalition paralyzed Iraq's command and control infrastructure in the first hours of the attack, leaving Hussein and senior leaders blind, deaf, dumb, and deceived. The Iraqi disorder was juxtaposed against the highly networked and synchronized United States military. Many American defence experts concluded that the resulting information differential proved critical to the subsequent speed and ease with which America and its allies routed Iraqi forces. As a result, the victory shoved thinking about information warfare into overdrive among the defence community. As military thinkers sought to understand the roots of the success in order to replicate it in the future, many concluded that information warfare was the secret weapon for quick and decisive victories going forward.\nThe DoD quickly directed the services to organize and train for information warfare in then-classified DoD Directive 3600.1 (DODD TS-3600.1), titled Information Warfare and released in December 1992. It served as the first indication that elements of modern-day cyber were entering the official policy of the military. The Department formally defined information warfare as the competition of opposing information systems to include the exploitation, corruption, or destruction of an adversary's information systems through such means as signals intelligence and command and control countermeasures while protecting the integrity of one's own information systems from such attacks. The objective of information warfare is to attain a significant enough information advantage to enable the force overall to predominate and to do so quickly.[33] The directive essentially tied together many of the related concepts the military had been experimenting with in the previous two decades. It combined the signals-intelligence-enabled precursors to cyber operations, which the military created to counter Soviet nuclear command and control, with the broader C2W ideas developed prior to and then used in Desert Storm. And it was all with the intent of replicating the speed and success of the Gulf War in future conflicts. While the directive served as the introduction of information warfare into defence policy, it was only the beginning, as the post-war period spawned a flurry of ideas and thinking about information warfare from which cyber would later emerge.\n\n# C. L. ROSS The sense of change and evolution presented by the digital revolution and Desert Storm was only magnified by the unexpected end of the Cold War. The pacing threat for the previous four decades suddenly disappeared and America found itself the lone superpower on the world stage.[34] The vacuum created by the dissolution of the USSR was quickly filled by a focus on high-profile terrorism. As the Soviet empire collapsed, the threat of Soviet nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue nations became a palpable fear for national leadership. The rise of high-profile terrorism as the most pressing security issue of the new century had a direct effect on the development of strategic thinking about cyberspace for the next two decades.\n# Terrorism and cyber Pearl Harbors President William Clinton's administration became the first to systematically deal with the issue of terrorism as it faced several terrorist attacks in the first years of his presidency.[35] However, it was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that proved most impactful on the president and for cyber operations. The bombing moved him personally, and it led him to wonder about the threat terrorists could pose to more strategic or symbolic locations throughout the country.[36] Through a number of subsequent events, he eventually appointed a Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (later known as the Marsh Commission after its lead, John Marsh) to investigate the vulnerability of important facilities to terrorist attacks.\nThe release of the commission's final report in October of 1997 surprised many by focusing primarily on cyber threats as opposed to traditional physical attacks. The commission noted that all critical infrastructure was dependent on unsecure information technology.[37] While the commission did not find evidence of impending cyber-attacks, it did discover widespread capabilities to exploit infrastructure vulnerabilities. Further, because the commission was created primarily to consider terrorist threats, it largely described the threat from cyber as coming from terrorists and criminals vice nation-state actors.[38] The report never explicitly compared cyber to nuclear weapons but, as with much of the contemporaneous literature, cyber threats were mentioned in the same context as terrorists using weapons of mass destruction.\n34George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 (Oxford UK: Oxford University Press 2011), 920.\n35Ibid., 936.\n36Clarke, Cyber War, 106.\n37Critical infrastructure examined in the report included transportation, oil and gas, water, emergency services, government services, banking and finance, electrical power, and telecommunications. See Robert T. Marsh, 'Critical Foundations: Protecting America's Infrastructures', The Report of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 13 October (Washington DC: 1997), 3-4.\n38Ibid., i.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # While the possibility of chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists adds a new and frightening dimension to physical attacks, such weapons are difficult to acquire. In contrast... a personal computer and a telephone connection to an Internet Service Provider anywhere in the world are enough to cause harm'.39 In reality, the cyber threat from terrorists would largely prove non-existent over the next twenty-five years.40 However, the report's focus on the devastation that a cyber-attack could cause to highly-vulnerable critical infrastructure, and its concentration on terrorists as the primary threat actors, further solidified conceptions of cyber-attacks as catastrophic surprise attacks that were launched by malignant individuals.\nThe urgent tone of the report was underscored by several prominent events that occurred within a couple of years of its release. In June 1997, the JCS launched a no-notice exercise known as ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 97 to test the cyber defences of DoD networks and critical infrastructure. The exercise was the brainchild of NSA Director Lt Gen Kenneth Minihan, who was frustrated at how little the DoD accounted for the threats or opportunities cyber presented in his previous years leading Air Force cyber operations.[41] Thirty-five NSA red-team hackers split into two teams—one in the United States and one on a ship in the Pacific. Armed with no inside information, and using only store-bought computers and hacking tools downloaded from the internet, they proceeded to run rampant through networks leaving marker files to prove where they had been.[42] According to Kaplan's interviews, the portion of the exercise devoted to national infrastructure attacks was a tabletop exercise without real-world intrusions. However, the attackers were actually allowed to penetrate defence networks for the other portion. In doing so, they were able to access the National Military Command Center, send false emails, reformat hard drives, alter communications, shut down phone lines, and sow doubt into command and control – much of what C2W and information warfare had envisioned throughout the preceding decade.[43] John Campbell, the Major General in charge of information operations on the Joint Staff, put it bluntly when he said, ‘... frankly it scared the hell out of a lot of folks because the implications of what this team had been able to do were pretty far-reaching’.[44] DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that it had ‘succeeded beyond its planner’s wildest dreams in elevating the awareness of threats to our computer systems’.[45] It shocked DoD Deputy 39Ibid., x.\n40While terrorists have relied heavily on the internet for recruiting, communications, and fundraising, there have been no major cyber-attacks or intrusions from terrorists; see Healey, Fierce Domain, 64.\n41Kaplan, Dark Territory, 64.\n42Healey, Fierce Domain, 42.\n43Kaplan, Dark Territory, 69-70.\n44John Campbell, 'Lessons from Our Cyber Past, The First Military Cyber Units', in Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain, 56.\n45Warner, 'Cybersecurity', 797.\n# C. L. ROSS Secretary and previous sceptic John Hamre, who later said that it showed 'This country is wide open to attack electronically... We didn't really let them take down the power system in the country, but we made them prove they knew how to do it'.46 ELIGIBLE RECEIVER provided a vivid example to policymakers of what the Marsh Commission had discussed only in hypotheticals, and it magnified the threat of information warfare to senior leaders on the Joint Staff.\nWhile the DoD was still processing the lessons learned from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, the Department experienced a series of intrusions in February 1998 dubbed SOLAR SUNRISE that sparked fears of the beginning of a real-world cyber war. Hamre, with the previous exercise fresh on his mind, notified the President early in the intrusions and said that the incident 'might be the first shots of a genuine cyber war, perhaps by Iraq'.[47] At the time, tensions were particularly high over Iraq's lack of cooperation with United Nations inspectors regarding its weapons of mass destruction program. Several intrusions were traced to the Middle East, leading many to believe Iraqi involvement. It proved to be an embarrassing example of the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace, as it turned out to be the work of California teenagers aided by an Israeli mentor.[48] Hamre later called it 'the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date', and it emotionally underlined leaders' previous fears from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER and the Marsh Commission, even though it ultimately had little impact.[49] It was in the environment of these prominent events that the Pearl Harbor analogy gained significant steam as officials tried to grow awareness of cyber threats. In the events that led to the Marsh Commission, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified to Congress, 'There is a present threat... We have not yet had a terrorist cyber-attack on the infrastructure. But I think that that is just a matter of time. We do not need to wait for the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor before we wake up to the threat and take steps to confront it'.[50] Senator Sam Nunn, who led the Congressional hearings, later said that the two most significant dangers America faced were terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons and a cyber Pearl Harbor.[51] In other hearings, 46John J. Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense, speech to the Fortune 500 CIO Forum, Aspen, Colorado, 21 July 1998 https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell//library/news/1998/07/t08121998_t072198.\n47Healey, Fierce Domain, 43.\n\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nDespite the chorus of predictions about cyber doomsday, some cautioned against the comparison. They noted that an attacker would need significant knowledge of the operating systems, hardware, and networks, as well as the interaction between all of those components, to create the systemic effects that experts warned about. The primary threat for that level of attack would more likely arise from a dedicated team of professionals employed by a nation-state. Thus, an attack would likely take place in a specific geopolitical context rather than being a bolt out of the blue.54 Nevertheless, the analogy became very popular and continued to gain steam over the next twenty years in sounding the alarm over cyber threats.\n## Increasing cyber awareness The inclusion of cyber threats in the National Security Strategies (NSS) during this period further reflected the government’s growing acceptance of the role of cyber in security issues. The 1997 NSS was the first to allude to cyber when it commented on technology making transnational threats more potent than before.55 It also included the first NSS comment – albeit a minor one – on the need to protect critical infrastructure from intrusion.56 The next NSS in 1999 indicated how much cyber thought advanced from the events of the intervening years. Defending critical infrastructure from paralyzing attacks was added to the list of vital national interests, alongside protecting the nation’s territory, citizens, allies, and economic well-being.57 In the large portions devoted to infrastructure, it focused heavily on the threats from cyberspace. As with other documents of the era, cyber-attacks were included in the list of technology advancements, along with weapons of mass destruction, that enabled terrorists or rogue nations to pose a greater risk than before. However, the awareness of cyber threats did not solely apply to\n\n# C. L. ROSS infrastructure. The 1999 NSS was also the first to discuss the importance of information superiority to military readiness and command and control.[58] The inclusion of information superiority in the NSS was a manifestation of the DoD's growing concern about information warfare throughout the period. The ongoing defence dialogue on information warfare adapted to and folded in many of the same insights and ideas that the Marsh Commission, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, and the SOLAR SUNRISE intrusions identified. Other internal studies and exercises only added to the concerns. Recognizing that the growth of cyberspace would profoundly impact national security, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a series of exercises on information warfare in 1996 to help develop a national information warfare strategy.[59] Their report identified that much of national infrastructure (what the Marsh Commission would later include in critical infrastructure) was connected to the internet and attacks on such would take on a strategic aspect. Thus, they framed the challenge as 'strategic information warfare'.[60] The more their participants became aware of information warfare's possibilities in the exercises, the more fearful they became of the impacts it could have. Only a couple of months later, the General Accounting Office warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the problems plaguing the civilian internet were increasingly threatening DoD information systems. They reported that 'The potential for catastrophic damage is great. Organized foreign nationals or terrorists could use\"information warfare\"techniques to disrupt military operations by harming command and control systems, the public switch network, and other systems or networks Defense relies on'.[61] Further, a report from the Defense Science Board Task Force on Information Warfare Defense in November of 1996 stated that cyberspace threats to infrastructure created 'a tunnel of vulnerability previously unrealized in the history of conflict'.[62] The possibilities of information warfare became increasingly dire the more military leaders considered it.\nThe arrival of the new century brought more high-profile cyber issues and they too were accompanied by a continual chorus of fears about cyber destruction. The year 2000 itself created significant concern in the computer community over the potential impacts it would have on how computers 58Ibid., 12.\n59Roger C. Molander, Andrew S. Riddle and Peter A.

There was widespread concern at the time that power, transportation, banking, and other critical systems would fail at midnight and cause the extensive panic envisioned in the cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios. Several internet worms also garnered significant attention around the same time. ILOVEYOU, Melissa, Code Red, NIMDA, SQL Slammer, and others captured headlines and the awareness of Americans. In February of 2000, a 16-year-old Canadian used a program downloaded off the internet to conduct a distributed-denial-of-service attack against Amazon, CNN, eBay, Yahoo, and others. Not only did it make headlines for simultaneously hitting several big companies, but it led President Clinton to organize the first White House roundtable on cybersecurity. While these public hacks drew a lot of press, none of them was deeply impactful, nor did they directly influence national security issues outside of elevating the prominence of cyber within the national conscious writ large. The most concerning thing about them was the constant drumbeat of articles warning that more dangerous attacks were imminent and that it was only a matter of time before cyber-terrorists brought the nation to its knees.\nA major cyber-espionage case in early 2001 actually did have a significant impact on the DoD, though its effects came in the form of information compromise. A series of intrusions dubbed MOONLIGHT MAZE launched a high-profile, multi-year investigation and provided the first indication of a changing threat environment. The details are still classified but the incursions appeared to have begun in March 1998 and affected hundreds of computers at NASA, the Pentagon, other governmental agencies, private universities, and research labs. SOLAR SUNRISE was a scare, but this event became truly worrying for policymakers. They appeared to be the first major intrusions conducted by a nation-state, they lasted for several years with disturbingly few clues about who was behind them or what they were taking, and the government could not seem to stop them. Evidence suggested Russian actors targeting unclassified sensitive technical research matters, but the sparse details caused discomfort. Two years after the discovery, James Adams, a member of NSA's advisory board, characterized the attack to the Washington Post as ‘the most persistent and serious computer attack against # C. L. ROSS the United States to date'. He also stated that attacks continued unabated and had triggered the 'largest cyber-intelligence investigation ever'. Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre, ever on the lookout for a cyber conflict, allegedly told congressional colleagues, 'We're in the middle of a cyberwar'.\nUnfortunately, everything in the national security apparatus turned upside down when the fears about a massive terrorist attack against critical American facilities became reality on 11 September of that year. While it neither came via cyber means nor did it cripple America, it did drastically revector the nation's defence as it absorbed the shock of the attacks and gradually funnelled its response into the Global War on Terror. In a continuation of the trends of the previous half-decade, news articles in the weeks following the attacks continued to warn that cyberspace would likely provide the vector for the next big strike. The shock of September $11^{\\text{th}}$ further cemented a fear of massive surprise attacks from unknown dark forces in the American psyche.\n# Cyber authorities and the first cyber strategies As the United States began both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the concepts for cyber operations as a distinct military capability began to solidify and mature, enabling further development of authorities and strategies for operating in cyberspace. While cyber was increasingly talked about as something distinct from information warfare, the two were still deeply intertwined and often used interchangeably into the 2000s. That began to change in official policy in late 1996 but it took several years for the distinction to fully materialize. In then-classified DoD Directive S-3600.1, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White rechristened information warfare to information operations and, for the first time in official documents, defined computer network attack. However, as cyber gradually emerged from information warfare as a distinct capability, its development and maturation were directly influenced by the conceptions formed over the previous two decades.\nThe Bush Administration's attempts to provide increased clarity on authorities for cyber operations in the run-up to the war shed light on American leadership's conceptions of cyber at that point in time. The Washington Post reported that Bush signed the classified National Security Presidential Directive 16 (NSPD-16) in July of 2002 to provide the first national-level guidance on when and how the United States would launch cyber-attacks against an adversary.[73] Predictably, the article likened the development to 71Vernon Loeb, 'NSA Adviser Says Cyber-Assaults On Pentagon Persist With Few Clues', The Washington Post, 7 May 2001, https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nsa-adviser-says-cyber-assaults-on-pentagon/docview/409117447/se-2?accountid=4332.\n72We're in the Middle of a Cyberwar', Newsweek, 19 September 1999.\n73Bradley Graham, 'Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare', The Washington Post, 7 February 2003, https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-pr04/readings/week5/bush_guidelines..\nthe formulation of guidelines in the early days of nuclear weapons. However, the article also discussed how the administration and the DoD were still wrestling with some of the aspects of cyber conflict and whether it should be unleashed. According to the article, part of the hesitation to launch attacks stemmed from America's vulnerability to cyber and concerns about establishing a norm that could be used against the United States. Richard Clarke, who had recently resigned from his post as Special Advisor to the President on Cybersecurity, highlighted another concern when he said, ‘There also is an issue, frankly, that's similar to the strategic nuclear issue which is: Do you ever want to do it? Do you want to legitimize that kind of weaponry?' The article insightfully concluded by saying, ‘Given the newness of the weapons, their potential power and the uncertainty about how they would work, the Pentagon's Joint Staff has issued classified “rules of engagement” that strictly require top-level approval for any cyber-attack'.\nThe DoD's then-classified Information Operations Roadmap, released in October of 2003, provided additional insights into the insider discussions regarding cyber authorities as well as military conceptions of cyber operations. The roadmap maintained five components for information operations but it replaced physical destruction with Computer Network Operations (CNO). It also included several recommendations devoted to CNA and Computer Network Defence (CND). One notable recommendation was that United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM, the parent command for cyber operations at the time) classify CNA capabilities into more refined categories that could allow for differentiated levels of authority to use them. The roadmap proposed three categories of weapons: those that could be allocated to a combatant commander, those pre-allocated to support aspects of specified operational or contingency plans, and those that were not assigned to combatant commanders and therefore required Secretary or Presidential approval. Not only was it remarkable as the first attempt to distinguish between levels of cyber weapons, rather than merely thinking of cyber as a single capability, but it also demonstrated that the authority to use cyber-attack techniques would still be restricted to very high-levels. It highlighted how, even with a more refined understanding of cyber weaponization, there was still a significant reticence to use them.\nThe advancement of cyber operations as a distinct military element itself accelerated in the years that followed. After the 2004 National Military Strategy declared cyberspace a warfighting domain for the first time, the # C. L. ROSS JCS released the first-ever military strategy for cyber operations in 2006. The then-classified National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations presented a far more nuanced and robust understanding of the domain than previous unclassified doctrine or policy statements. It provided an updated definition for cyberspace along with a list of domain characteristics and key features that drove the strategy's development.[78] The only strategic end that has been declassified was the first one, which sought to deter adversaries 'from establishing or employing offensive capabilities against US interests in cyberspace'.[79] It is unclear if 'establishing' referred to preventing the development of cyber capabilities. If so, it would have been a lofty goal to say the least, as the low barrier to entry made it virtually impossible to stop. However, it would have mirrored concepts of nuclear non-proliferation, which seek to prevent nations from even developing nuclear weapons in the first place due to their destructive power. In pursuing deterrence by imposing costs, denying benefits, and 'inducing adversary restraint based on demonstrated US capabilities', the strategy ultimately echoed elements within existing nuclear deterrence theory.[80] Although defence and national security leadership matured their ideas and strategy concerning cyberspace in the early years of the Global War on Terror, it did not become a major personal focus for President George W. Bush until the end of his time in office. However, that changed with a meeting in April 2007. It appears that President Bush approved a covert action request within the first five minutes of what was supposed to be an hour-long meeting.[81] Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), took advantage of the newly-available fifty-five minutes to talk to the president about McConnell's concerns for national cyber defence – a major topic of anxiety for him. McConnell would later talk about cyber threats, specifically an attack against the financial industry or critical infrastructure, as one of the primary threats that kept him up at night.[82] His inclusion of cyber as a new weapon of mass destruction alongside nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the same interview clearly demonstrated how he thought about the threat from cyber operations.[83] McConnell used the time with 78Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Military Strategy of Cyberspace Operations, December 2006. This document is now partially declassified. https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/21419-document-23 79Ibid., 13.\n80Ibid.\n81Details about the meeting's content come primarily from secondary sources. In Playing to the Edge, Hayden provided the only primary source material when he specifically credited DNI McConnell with selling Bush on the 'immediacy of the cyber threat and convinced him to launch the CNCI', 177. Kaplan's Dark Territory includes a more in-depth telling of events based on his interviews of unknown members, 174-178. Clarke's Cyber War provides fewer details than Kaplan but they largely agree with Kaplan's narrative, 114.\n82Mike McConnell, interview by Charlie Rose, The Charlie Rose Show, PBS, 8 January 2009. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Speeches%20and%20Interviews/20090108_interview.pdf 83Ibid.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # the President to highlight many of the previous decade's findings about America's vulnerability to cyber-attacks as well as its potential for strategic impact on national security. To punctuate his point to Bush, McConnell purportedly told the president that if Al Qaeda had been smarter, they would have launched a cyber-attack against a major bank in New York City and corrupted the files, which would have caused more economic damage than the attack on the Twin Towers.[84] The discussion apparently lit a fire under the president and he directed McConnell to quickly produce a solution.[85] When McConnell later told the president that the plan would be expensive, Bush allegedly said that he was willing to spend as much as had been spent on the Manhattan Project to work towards solutions.[86] The result was the then-classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative as outlined in NSPD-54 Cybersecurity Policy. The initiative sought to improve the defence of government systems as well as those critical to national security, national economic security, or public health and safety.[87] While the funding details are not clear, it was reported to include tens of billions of dollars, which demonstrated the administration's level of concern over the issue.[88] The initiative was rebranded by the incoming Obama administration but largely kept the same structure. The growing conceptions regarding both the threats and opportunities of cyber operations eventually led Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to approve the stand-up of a combatant command dedicated to the domain of cyberspace the following year.[89] # Conclusion The historical development of cyber within the United States leading up to the creation of USCYBERCOM demonstrates several recurring themes that shaped national and defence leaders' conceptions about cyber operations. The first theme is that cyber operations were birthed in strategic applications. They were first introduced to disrupt and defeat Soviet nuclear forces and their command and control. Those concepts were later applied against Iraqi leadership in Desert Storm with smashing success. The desire to replicate such a definitive victory in future conflicts spawned two subsequent decades 84Kaplan, Dark Territory, 174.\n85Kaplan's Dark Territory records Bush saying he wanted a solution in thirty days, 175, while Clarke's Cyber War quoted him saying, 'I want a plan, soon, real soon', 114.\n86Kaplan, Dark Territory, 178.\n87National Security Presidential Directive, 54, Cybersecurity Policy, 8 January 2008, 4. https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-54.pdf. This document is now partially declassified.\n88Kaplan's Dark Territory reported the administration requested $18B over five years, 178. Clarke's Cyber War pegged the number at $50B over five years. Others reported $3.6B alone allocated to it in 2011, see Eric Chabrow, 'CNCI Budget Request Set at $3.6 Billion', GovInfoSecurity, 2 February 2010, https://www.govinfosecurity.com/cnci-budget-request-set-at-36-billion-a-2151.\n89Robert Gates, Duty (New York City NY: Alfred A. Knopf 2014), 193-4.\nof evolving thought over how to quickly win wars by using information and computers to cripple adversary leadership and their strategic systems.\nThe second theme is that leaders increasingly feared the potential of a cyber attack against critical infrastructure. The growing interconnectivity of vital data, networks, and infrastructure meant that those elements were becoming progressively more vulnerable to cyber threats. The strategic nature of those targets meant that cyber operations could theoretically have strategic impacts on critical societal and warfighting functions, which dominated senior leaders' thinking about the threat. Early advocates regularly used the doomsday possibility of a ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage.\nThe final theme is that early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives concentrated on nuclear war and high-profile terrorism, and it became easily interwoven with both. Computers and the internet were exciting and novel technologies to the majority of Americans during the early days of cyber, including senior leaders, but few understood much about how either computers or the internet worked. However, they were regularly told that a teenager with a computer bought at RadioShack could now cause disruption on the scale of nuclear weapons. Additionally, most of the cyber-attacks they read about in the news came from mischievous individuals as bolts out of the blue. Cyber operations were thus easily linked in the minds of senior leaders to the leading security issues of the times -- nuclear weapons and high-profile terrorism.\nUntil further information is declassified regarding cyber operations that occurred during the time period, it will be impossible to fully assess how much the rhetoric matched reality. Still, the context within which strategic thought develops influences the direction that it will go. Although obvious when stated, it is a truism that strategists and leaders neglect at their own peril. The context surrounding the development of thought regarding cyberspace in America affected the frameworks, authorities, and operations that leaders applied to the domain, potentially to the benefit and detriment of national security. Fears of a cyber Pearl Harbor enabled advocates to garner attention and resources for cyber issues. However, the focus on catastrophic attacks led to an underappreciation of how a campaign of individually inconsequential events can shape geopolitical contexts towards favourable ends. Early intrusions by computer-savvy teenagers highlighted the insecure nature of networks and facilitated the initial development of cybersecurity. Yet they also created unrealistic expectations in leaders about how easy it would be for future cyber operators to create on-order effects against hard targets. Describing cyber-attacks as moving at the speed of light and capable of reaching anywhere in the networked world helped leaders to understand the potential of cyber operations. But it also downplayed the intense time and work required to locate a desired network, gain access, understand the environment, and then develop capabilities to achieve specific and predictable effects. The true impact or validity of these conceptions can only be fully determined once more information becomes available. However, they serve as a reminder to leaders about the need to continuously examine the assumptions and reasoning from which they are operating -- always seeking to validate or disprove them -- to ensure that their cognitive frameworks best reflect reality as it is.\n## Acknowledgments The author would like to thank C.

Ross Schriever Space Scholars, Air Command and Staff College, Montgomery, AL, USA # ABSTRACT Futurist depictions of cyber-attacks in coming wars often portray them as bolts out of the blue that will cause immense damage to a nation's warfighting capacity and create chaos among its populace by crippling its essential services. However, those depictions are based more on prophecy than they are on historical realities. The historical development of conceptions about cyber operations explains how those themes came to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States. Rather than being self-evident, the themes are a result of the application of early cyber efforts to strategic operations, advocacy that focused on doomsday scenarios to draw attention to cybersecurity problems, and the ease with which cyber threats were tied to the primary strategic narratives of American national security during their development.\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 September 2022; Accepted 18 November 2023 KEYWORDS Cyber; Pearl Harbor; cybersecurity; information warfare; information operations; cyberspace; future war # Introduction In his 2011 book Cyber War, Richard Clarke, the former Special Advisor to the President for Cybersecurity, outlined a fictional depiction of a full-scale cyber war in America. His scenario began with the White House Situation Room receiving a message from the National Security Agency (NSA) about multiple malware targeting critical infrastructure before the desk officer subsequently becomes bombarded with messages about systems failing across the country. Department of Defense networks go offline, gas refineries explode in multiple major cities, chemical plants leak poisonous gas into the environment, aeroplanes collide in mid-air after air traffic control centres lose their air picture, and rail traffic ceased due to trains and subways derailing at key junction points.

Americans panic and looting ensues as a result of the breakdown of essential services in the days that follow, which completely overwhelms the police and emergency services. He concluded by saying that 'A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country'.\nWhile notable for the exceedingly grim nature of his prediction, it is largely consistent with the chorus of prognostications regarding the impact that cyber operations will play in the future. As Andy Greenberg at Wired puts it, 'The threat of cyberwar looms over the future: a new dimension of conflict capable of leapfrogging borders and teleporting the chaos of war to civilians thousands of miles beyond its front'. Fiction literature about the future of war is riddled with these themes. Ghost Fleet, a novel by political scientist and futurist P. W. Singer, details a Chinese surprise attack against the United States that largely succeeds due to crippling cyber-attacks against American weapon systems and infrastructure. Similarly, Admiral James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman's novel 2034 includes cyber-attacks that cause national power blackouts and government computer lockouts, while also disabling fighter aircraft and naval vessels across the globe. The themes are not unique to fictional stories though – indeed, the authors included those elements in the plotlines precisely because they capture the fears of policymakers in the real world. Testifying before Congress in 2011, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta talked about how the next Pearl Harbor-type attack likely could come from a cyber-attack. 'If you have a cyber-attack that brings down our power-grid system, brings down our financial system, brings down our government systems, you could paralyze this country... And I think that's a real potential'. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, echoed the sentiment and said that the threat from cyber operations 'is increasing in scope and scale, and its impact is difficult to overstate'.\nInterestingly, these images of cyber operations seem to be grounded in prophesy rather than historical realities. While cyber has become associated with the image of a catastrophic surprise attack, the history of cyber-attacks has been dominated by the less dramatic elements of espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Likewise, the strategic state conflicts that have included cyber elements did not include surprise cyber-attacks. Instead, they took place in larger geopolitical conflicts that offered ample warning time for 1Richard A. Clarke, Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It (New York, NY: Harper Collins 2010), 67.\n2Jason Ryan, 'CIA Director Leon Panetta Warns of Possible Cyber-Pearl Harbor', ABC News, 10 February 2011, https://abcnews.go.com/News/cia-director-leon-panetta-warns-cyber-pearl-harbor/story?id=12888905.\n3Ibid.\n# C. L. ROSS defenders. Moreover, the assumptions about the fragility of modern interconnected societies that underpin these themes have largely gone unquestioned despite the fact that similar assumptions about the effects of strategic bombing proved questionable in the Second World War. Strategic bombing failed to break German or Japanese will and economies proved far more resilient than air-power proponents believed, yet many readily assume that massive cyber-attacks today would succeed where millions of tons of high explosives could not. The question becomes, how have these themes come to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States?\nUnfortunately, little work has been done to understand the historical development of cyber thinking. In fact, literature on the history of cyber operations in general is rather sparse. Fred Kaplan's Dark Territory is perhaps the most well-known work, but as a journalist writing for a popular audience, it does not provide many details regarding its source material. The Atlantic Council's A Fierce Domain, edited by Jason Healey, is the best scholarly work. It provides a general background but its primary focus is several case studies documenting specific cyber events. USCYBERCOM's historian, Michael Warner, has also written a number of useful articles on the history of cyber operations. However, even fewer authors have explored the intellectual and cultural history of cyber thinking. Thomas Rid's Cyber War Will Not Take Place includes historical case studies and makes an argument that cyber operations should not be considered a form of warfare, but he does not fully trace how contemporaries considered them, how those conceptions changed over time, nor what factors influenced those changes. His Rise of the Machines provides a rich history of the ideas and field of cybernetics, which tangentially relates to cyber operations, but it does not examine the idea of cyber operations directly. Sarah White's recent doctoral thesis titled Subcultural Influences on Military Innovation: The Development of U.S. Military Cyber Doctrine comes closest to documenting the progression of thought, but it more specifically explores the influence of service culture and operational experience on military approaches to new technologies.\nYet understanding that historical development is vitally important. Charting the history of conceptions about cyber operations provides critical insights into how the current images of cyber rose to such prominence in the American psyche. The ideas were not self-evident but instead were formed and framed by several cultural, social, political, and military factors and events. Understanding the evolution of those conceptions is also no mere 4Jason Healey, 'A Brief History of US Cyber Conflict', in Jason Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain (Washington DC: Cyber Conflict Studies Association 2013), 17.\n5For a great historical study of the conceptual development of strategic bombing and the impact those conceptions had in the employment of bombers in World War II, see Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press 2004).\nintellectual exercise -- ideas influence action, policy, and strategy, and incorrect ideas can lead to disastrous results. Moreover, knowing the assumptions and reasoning that underpinned the early development of strategic thinking can facilitate more thoughtful policy and strategy in the future. Outlining the flow of ideas from previous generations enables leaders and policymakers to better assess their own assumptions and reasoning as they wrestle with current and future challenges.\nIn examining the historical development of American strategic thought regarding cyber operations, three major themes influenced how cyber was conceived leading up to the creation of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009. First, initial cyber capability development in the United States occurred in the context of strategic operations. The primary targets for initial cyber operations, the impact they sought to produce, and the problems they tried to solve all centred around nuclear operations or strategic leadership decision-making. Second, the increasing interconnectivity of critical data and infrastructure meant that cyber operations could theoretically have massive impacts on the economy and national security. Early advocates regularly focused on these doomsday possibilities in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage. Finally, early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives regarding nuclear war and high-profile terrorism. The potential impact and low barrier of entry of cyber operations made it easy for senior leaders to associate cyber with those strategic narratives. These three threads emerge as the most formative themes in the development of conceptions about cyber, and they led senior leaders to view cyber capabilities as strategic weapons capable of impacts on par with weapons of mass destruction.\n## A note on definitions Providing clear and unified definitions for cyber and cyberspace is a recurring struggle and theme of the history of military cyber efforts. Definitions for terms like cyberspace, cyber operations, information warfare, command and control warfare, and others have evolved throughout time. As such, it is difficult to use terms consistently throughout the article, particularly because there was significant overlap between the various terms and they were used almost synonymously during certain periods of time. However, the intent is to understand how cyberspace and cyber operations came to be understood as they are today.\nSince 2008, joint doctrine has defined cyberspace as ‘A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, # C. L. ROSS telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'.6 Thus, cyber operations are plainly defined as 'The employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace'.7 While individuals, organizations, and military services have emphasized particular aspects in their use of the term cyber (for example the networks, the information, the electromagnetic spectrum, etc.), I intend the terms 'cyber' and 'cyber operations' to synonymously capture the imprecise ideas that American national security professionals commonly mean when they discuss the terms today, which broadly centre around concepts of computer hacking. Essentially, they refer to operations that disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, along with operations taken to prevent others from doing the same. When military members talk of using 'cyber' to disrupt an integrated air defence system, suggest that the next war will begin with 'cyber', or talk of a 'cyber' officer, they are typically referring to cyber as a distinct military capability that includes using a computer system to achieve some effect on another computer system or its information, while also trying to prevent the same from occurring on one's own systems. It is in that sense that I use the terms cyber and cyber operations.\n# Cyber precursors Disrupting an adversary's communications, information warfare, and using the electromagnetic spectrum to achieve objectives are not new phenomena. However, the march towards the modern version of conflict within cyberspace began because of two trends in the latter half of the $21^{\\text{st}}$ century. First, the exponential growth of electrical computing technology and its proliferation within the security apparatus increasingly presented the possibility of exploitation by adversaries. Second, the movement towards storing and transporting wealth and secrets in digital data, along with the growth of strategic systems reliant on computers and networking, produced growing motivation for adversaries to take advantage of those possibilities. Together, these trends gradually produced and elevated cyber-related issues as concerns for national security.\nAlmost from the very beginning of the digital revolution, analysts identified inherent security issues with the explosion of digital technology in the United States Air Force, Air Force Doctrine Publications 3-12 - Cyberspace Operations (Washington DC 2023), 6, https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/AFDP_3-12/3-12-AFDP-CYBERSPACE-OPS.pdf.\n\nDepartment of Defense, United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms (Washington DC: Department of Defense 2019), 233.\n8Michael Warner, 'A Brief History of Cyber Conflict', in Schneider et al. (ed.), Ten Years In (Newport RI: Naval War College 2020), 15.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # military. Thomas Rona, a Boeing advisor to the Secretary of Defense's Office of Net Assessment, wrote a paper in 1976 titled 'Weapon Systems and Information War' that wrestled with the challenges introduced by the information age. He noted that the growing complexity of weapon systems meant that they were increasingly dependent upon external information sources for successful engagements, whether it be intelligence, targeting information, or command and control orders.[9] That dependency created the possibility that weapon systems could be defeated through information denial. Of course, these changes produced both opportunities and vulnerabilities – information warfare could cut both ways. The United States needed to consider how to attack an adversary's information flow as well as how it would protect its own.[10] While his report focused on information warfare predominantly as a means to defeat weapon systems, Rona recognized that there were broader implications and opportunities for strategic warfare.[11] While Rona looked at information warfare broadly applied to weapons, others focused more specifically on the threat to command and control. As computers became more integrated with the control and employment of force, military members increasingly regarded them as critical assets that required defending as well as potential targets that could be exploited. A 1976 Defense Science Board study on conventional force counters to a Warsaw Pact attack highlighted how disruption of Soviet troop control systems could serve as a critical counterbalance to their numerical superiority.[12] As American awareness subsequently grew regarding Soviet reliance on a tightly controlled and automated system for directing their forces, the military increasingly viewed attacks on the Soviet command and control structure as vital force multipliers. Consequently, the Department of Defense (DoD) began developing a set of doctrinal ideas eventually known as command-and-control warfare (C2W) in 1979 in an effort to negate the numerical advantage of Soviet forces. C2W concepts became highly intertwined with those of information warfare over the next two decades, and both served as the cocoon within which military conceptions of cyber operations initially developed.\nThe increasing digitization also produced greater overlap with signals intelligence techniques. While traditional communications collection relied on intercepting analog signals transmitted on telephone lines or broadcast over the air, digital signals required more robust processing to break out the data and information. The National Security Agency (NSA) and signals It's Col Evan H. Parrott, 'C3CM: Theory, Application, and Process', Research Report, February (Maxwell Air Force Base: Air War College 1983), 14.\nintelligence organizations in the military were on the front lines of this new frontier since they led the effort to discover and collect adversary command and control information. Thus, they were also optimally positioned to be able to manipulate that information or the systems they resided within.\nAs signals intelligence produced greater access into Soviet systems, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought to operationalize them in 1982 through a little-known organization called the Joint Special Studies Group. According to Bruce Berkowitz, the purpose of JSSG was to ‘determine whether vulnerabilities identified from critical node analysis, such as message intercepts, jamming, and signals injection into adversary networks, could be turned into a military or intelligence capability'. The goal was to find ways to affect their automated command and control network or to sow doubts about the integrity of the information in the minds of Soviet leaders. By 1984 though, policymakers, including President Ronald Reagan, began to get concerned about the ability to control the effects of information warfare techniques, especially since they were directed toward strategic Soviet systems and could create considerable problems if they went awry. In the end, while the JSSG was able to model Soviet nuclear communication networks, they never discovered a silver bullet to guarantee disruption of communications, and the program was shut down in 1989 with the end of the Cold War. However, their concepts served as major forerunners to Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA).\nJust as the Joint Chiefs were standing up the JSSG, elements within pop culture began to use hacking-related themes that impacted national security in surprising ways. The 1983 film WarGames starring Matthew Broderick initiated several governmental actions regarding computer security and created enduring conceptions of the cyber threat. The movie details a teenage hacker who almost starts a global nuclear war when he accidentally hacks into a supercomputer at NORAD. In June of 1983, Reagan watched the film while on retreat at Camp David and he proceeded to discuss the plot with members of Congress as well as his national security staff. According to journalist Fred Kaplan, Reagan's inquiries into whether the film's plot could play out in real life led him to discover that the threat of computer intrusion was even worse than he imagined. The subsequent string of events ultimately led to the confidential National Security Decision Directive 145 (NSDD- THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # 145), titled National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security. It served as the first time that presidential policy addressed what would later become aspects of cyber operations and it originated over concerns about cyber actions leading to nuclear conflict.\nThe President was not the only one concerned about the feasibility of the plot – American media organizations anxiously questioned governmental officials about it following the release of the film. The three major television networks ran a flurry of reports about computer and networking technology using WarGames as a framework for understanding their inherent dangers. Also, much of the reporting discussed it in the context of nuclear war.[20] A four-minute clip from the movie was shown at the opening of congressional hearings on computer security and representatives referenced the film throughout the hearings to help members conceptualize the threat.[21] Ultimately, those hearings led to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984.[22] Not only did the film enable both Presidential and Congressional action, but the movie also popularized the impression that hacking was the realm of anti-establishment teenagers and a potential weapon for global destruction.[23] Those conceptions provided a powerful framing effect for subsequent cyber events.\n# The Morris worm and Desert Storm Only a couple of years later, a real-world event both resonated with and evolved those conceptions. In November 1988, Robert T. Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell graduate student, released a worm onto the NSFNet, a precursor to the internet, from a remotely-accessed computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[24] The worm did not cause any damage to systems or data but within a manner of hours it had infected up to $10\\%$ of the network.[25] Its replication and spread clogged the processing power of computers to the point of crashing many of the systems.

L. ROSS convey the impact that the Morris worm had on the psyche of both the computer community and the nation writ large. While many researchers understood that networks and computers were vulnerable, the speed with which the virus spread across such extensive networks gave them a queasy feeling that they had experienced a close call.[26] A few simple alterations would have enabled the worm to destroy massive amounts of data or compromise large portions of sensitive research and defence information.[27] The ease and rapidity of its spread led pundits and officials to begin to ask about the vulnerability of other computer networks that business and infrastructure increasingly depended on. If a single individual could achieve such widespread effects, what could an individual do if they targeted systems associated with national security?\nUnsurprisingly, the event helped reinforce the early image of the malicious individual as the primary threat in cyberspace. While numerous news articles noted that the worm served as a giant wake-up call, the threat was commonly framed as one from hackers and terrorists as opposed to nation states or militaries.[28] That image was fortified by Dutch teenagers hacking into 34 American military installation networks between 1990–91, and young British hackers accessing networks at the Air Force's Rome Labs before routing through to a South Korean nuclear institute in 1994.[29] Policymakers increasingly worried about the impact well-resourced and determined individuals could have if teenagers were able to access such a wide swath of computers. Computer security expert Winn Schwartau did little to abate those fears when he testified in congress in 1991 that governmental and commercial systems were essentially defenceless and an 'electronic Pearl Harbor' was waiting to happen.[30] As early as the late 1980s, conceptions about cyber threats as primarily coming from malignant individuals and capable of devastating impact were already front and centre in the national dialogue about cyber.\nJust as Morris was going to trial, President George H. W. Bush ordered the bombardment of Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In a manner of weeks, the United States defeated a battle-hardened 26Peter J. Denning, 'The Science of Computing: The Internet Worm', American Scientist 77/2 (March–April 1989), 127.\n27Assistant Comptroller General, Computer Security, 4.\n28Most often they are subtle references but suggest that many viewed the threat as being one from malevolently motivated individuals. This is a representative example from a Wall St. Journal article: 'If computers can be sabotaged so easily, so swiftly, experts wonder, how vulnerable is the system to high-tech terrorists?'

The coalition paralyzed Iraq's command and control infrastructure in the first hours of the attack, leaving Hussein and senior leaders blind, deaf, dumb, and deceived. The Iraqi disorder was juxtaposed against the highly networked and synchronized United States military. Many American defence experts concluded that the resulting information differential proved critical to the subsequent speed and ease with which America and its allies routed Iraqi forces. As a result, the victory shoved thinking about information warfare into overdrive among the defence community. As military thinkers sought to understand the roots of the success in order to replicate it in the future, many concluded that information warfare was the secret weapon for quick and decisive victories going forward.\nThe DoD quickly directed the services to organize and train for information warfare in then-classified DoD Directive 3600.1 (DODD TS-3600.1), titled Information Warfare and released in December 1992. It served as the first indication that elements of modern-day cyber were entering the official policy of the military. The Department formally defined information warfare as the competition of opposing information systems to include the exploitation, corruption, or destruction of an adversary's information systems through such means as signals intelligence and command and control countermeasures while protecting the integrity of one's own information systems from such attacks. The objective of information warfare is to attain a significant enough information advantage to enable the force overall to predominate and to do so quickly.[33] The directive essentially tied together many of the related concepts the military had been experimenting with in the previous two decades. It combined the signals-intelligence-enabled precursors to cyber operations, which the military created to counter Soviet nuclear command and control, with the broader C2W ideas developed prior to and then used in Desert Storm. And it was all with the intent of replicating the speed and success of the Gulf War in future conflicts. While the directive served as the introduction of information warfare into defence policy, it was only the beginning, as the post-war period spawned a flurry of ideas and thinking about information warfare from which cyber would later emerge.\n\n# C. L. ROSS The sense of change and evolution presented by the digital revolution and Desert Storm was only magnified by the unexpected end of the Cold War. The pacing threat for the previous four decades suddenly disappeared and America found itself the lone superpower on the world stage.[34] The vacuum created by the dissolution of the USSR was quickly filled by a focus on high-profile terrorism. As the Soviet empire collapsed, the threat of Soviet nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue nations became a palpable fear for national leadership. The rise of high-profile terrorism as the most pressing security issue of the new century had a direct effect on the development of strategic thinking about cyberspace for the next two decades.\n# Terrorism and cyber Pearl Harbors President William Clinton's administration became the first to systematically deal with the issue of terrorism as it faced several terrorist attacks in the first years of his presidency.[35] However, it was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that proved most impactful on the president and for cyber operations. The bombing moved him personally, and it led him to wonder about the threat terrorists could pose to more strategic or symbolic locations throughout the country.[36] Through a number of subsequent events, he eventually appointed a Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (later known as the Marsh Commission after its lead, John Marsh) to investigate the vulnerability of important facilities to terrorist attacks.\nThe release of the commission's final report in October of 1997 surprised many by focusing primarily on cyber threats as opposed to traditional physical attacks. The commission noted that all critical infrastructure was dependent on unsecure information technology.[37] While the commission did not find evidence of impending cyber-attacks, it did discover widespread capabilities to exploit infrastructure vulnerabilities. Further, because the commission was created primarily to consider terrorist threats, it largely described the threat from cyber as coming from terrorists and criminals vice nation-state actors.[38] The report never explicitly compared cyber to nuclear weapons but, as with much of the contemporaneous literature, cyber threats were mentioned in the same context as terrorists using weapons of mass destruction.\n34George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 (Oxford UK: Oxford University Press 2011), 920.\n35Ibid., 936.\n36Clarke, Cyber War, 106.\n37Critical infrastructure examined in the report included transportation, oil and gas, water, emergency services, government services, banking and finance, electrical power, and telecommunications. See Robert T. Marsh, 'Critical Foundations: Protecting America's Infrastructures', The Report of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 13 October (Washington DC: 1997), 3-4.\n38Ibid., i.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # While the possibility of chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists adds a new and frightening dimension to physical attacks, such weapons are difficult to acquire. In contrast... a personal computer and a telephone connection to an Internet Service Provider anywhere in the world are enough to cause harm'.39 In reality, the cyber threat from terrorists would largely prove non-existent over the next twenty-five years.40 However, the report's focus on the devastation that a cyber-attack could cause to highly-vulnerable critical infrastructure, and its concentration on terrorists as the primary threat actors, further solidified conceptions of cyber-attacks as catastrophic surprise attacks that were launched by malignant individuals.\nThe urgent tone of the report was underscored by several prominent events that occurred within a couple of years of its release. In June 1997, the JCS launched a no-notice exercise known as ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 97 to test the cyber defences of DoD networks and critical infrastructure. The exercise was the brainchild of NSA Director Lt Gen Kenneth Minihan, who was frustrated at how little the DoD accounted for the threats or opportunities cyber presented in his previous years leading Air Force cyber operations.[41] Thirty-five NSA red-team hackers split into two teams—one in the United States and one on a ship in the Pacific. Armed with no inside information, and using only store-bought computers and hacking tools downloaded from the internet, they proceeded to run rampant through networks leaving marker files to prove where they had been.[42] According to Kaplan's interviews, the portion of the exercise devoted to national infrastructure attacks was a tabletop exercise without real-world intrusions. However, the attackers were actually allowed to penetrate defence networks for the other portion. In doing so, they were able to access the National Military Command Center, send false emails, reformat hard drives, alter communications, shut down phone lines, and sow doubt into command and control – much of what C2W and information warfare had envisioned throughout the preceding decade.[43] John Campbell, the Major General in charge of information operations on the Joint Staff, put it bluntly when he said, ‘... frankly it scared the hell out of a lot of folks because the implications of what this team had been able to do were pretty far-reaching’.[44] DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that it had ‘succeeded beyond its planner’s wildest dreams in elevating the awareness of threats to our computer systems’.[45] It shocked DoD Deputy 39Ibid., x.\n40While terrorists have relied heavily on the internet for recruiting, communications, and fundraising, there have been no major cyber-attacks or intrusions from terrorists; see Healey, Fierce Domain, 64.\n41Kaplan, Dark Territory, 64.\n42Healey, Fierce Domain, 42.\n43Kaplan, Dark Territory, 69-70.\n44John Campbell, 'Lessons from Our Cyber Past, The First Military Cyber Units', in Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain, 56.\n45Warner, 'Cybersecurity', 797.\n# C. L. ROSS Secretary and previous sceptic John Hamre, who later said that it showed 'This country is wide open to attack electronically... We didn't really let them take down the power system in the country, but we made them prove they knew how to do it'.46 ELIGIBLE RECEIVER provided a vivid example to policymakers of what the Marsh Commission had discussed only in hypotheticals, and it magnified the threat of information warfare to senior leaders on the Joint Staff.\nWhile the DoD was still processing the lessons learned from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, the Department experienced a series of intrusions in February 1998 dubbed SOLAR SUNRISE that sparked fears of the beginning of a real-world cyber war. Hamre, with the previous exercise fresh on his mind, notified the President early in the intrusions and said that the incident 'might be the first shots of a genuine cyber war, perhaps by Iraq'.[47] At the time, tensions were particularly high over Iraq's lack of cooperation with United Nations inspectors regarding its weapons of mass destruction program. Several intrusions were traced to the Middle East, leading many to believe Iraqi involvement. It proved to be an embarrassing example of the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace, as it turned out to be the work of California teenagers aided by an Israeli mentor.[48] Hamre later called it 'the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date', and it emotionally underlined leaders' previous fears from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER and the Marsh Commission, even though it ultimately had little impact.[49] It was in the environment of these prominent events that the Pearl Harbor analogy gained significant steam as officials tried to grow awareness of cyber threats. In the events that led to the Marsh Commission, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified to Congress, 'There is a present threat... We have not yet had a terrorist cyber-attack on the infrastructure. But I think that that is just a matter of time. We do not need to wait for the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor before we wake up to the threat and take steps to confront it'.[50] Senator Sam Nunn, who led the Congressional hearings, later said that the two most significant dangers America faced were terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons and a cyber Pearl Harbor.[51] In other hearings, 46John J. Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense, speech to the Fortune 500 CIO Forum, Aspen, Colorado, 21 July 1998 https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell//library/news/1998/07/t08121998_t072198.\n47Healey, Fierce Domain, 43.\n\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nDespite the chorus of predictions about cyber doomsday, some cautioned against the comparison. They noted that an attacker would need significant knowledge of the operating systems, hardware, and networks, as well as the interaction between all of those components, to create the systemic effects that experts warned about. The primary threat for that level of attack would more likely arise from a dedicated team of professionals employed by a nation-state. Thus, an attack would likely take place in a specific geopolitical context rather than being a bolt out of the blue.54 Nevertheless, the analogy became very popular and continued to gain steam over the next twenty years in sounding the alarm over cyber threats.\n## Increasing cyber awareness The inclusion of cyber threats in the National Security Strategies (NSS) during this period further reflected the government’s growing acceptance of the role of cyber in security issues. The 1997 NSS was the first to allude to cyber when it commented on technology making transnational threats more potent than before.55 It also included the first NSS comment – albeit a minor one – on the need to protect critical infrastructure from intrusion.56 The next NSS in 1999 indicated how much cyber thought advanced from the events of the intervening years. Defending critical infrastructure from paralyzing attacks was added to the list of vital national interests, alongside protecting the nation’s territory, citizens, allies, and economic well-being.57 In the large portions devoted to infrastructure, it focused heavily on the threats from cyberspace. As with other documents of the era, cyber-attacks were included in the list of technology advancements, along with weapons of mass destruction, that enabled terrorists or rogue nations to pose a greater risk than before. However, the awareness of cyber threats did not solely apply to\n\n# C. L. ROSS infrastructure. The 1999 NSS was also the first to discuss the importance of information superiority to military readiness and command and control.[58] The inclusion of information superiority in the NSS was a manifestation of the DoD's growing concern about information warfare throughout the period. The ongoing defence dialogue on information warfare adapted to and folded in many of the same insights and ideas that the Marsh Commission, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, and the SOLAR SUNRISE intrusions identified. Other internal studies and exercises only added to the concerns. Recognizing that the growth of cyberspace would profoundly impact national security, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a series of exercises on information warfare in 1996 to help develop a national information warfare strategy.[59] Their report identified that much of national infrastructure (what the Marsh Commission would later include in critical infrastructure) was connected to the internet and attacks on such would take on a strategic aspect. Thus, they framed the challenge as 'strategic information warfare'.[60] The more their participants became aware of information warfare's possibilities in the exercises, the more fearful they became of the impacts it could have. Only a couple of months later, the General Accounting Office warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the problems plaguing the civilian internet were increasingly threatening DoD information systems. They reported that 'The potential for catastrophic damage is great. Organized foreign nationals or terrorists could use\"information warfare\"techniques to disrupt military operations by harming command and control systems, the public switch network, and other systems or networks Defense relies on'.[61] Further, a report from the Defense Science Board Task Force on Information Warfare Defense in November of 1996 stated that cyberspace threats to infrastructure created 'a tunnel of vulnerability previously unrealized in the history of conflict'.[62] The possibilities of information warfare became increasingly dire the more military leaders considered it.\nThe arrival of the new century brought more high-profile cyber issues and they too were accompanied by a continual chorus of fears about cyber destruction. The year 2000 itself created significant concern in the computer community over the potential impacts it would have on how computers 58Ibid., 12.\n59Roger C. Molander, Andrew S. Riddle and Peter A.

There was widespread concern at the time that power, transportation, banking, and other critical systems would fail at midnight and cause the extensive panic envisioned in the cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios. Several internet worms also garnered significant attention around the same time. ILOVEYOU, Melissa, Code Red, NIMDA, SQL Slammer, and others captured headlines and the awareness of Americans. In February of 2000, a 16-year-old Canadian used a program downloaded off the internet to conduct a distributed-denial-of-service attack against Amazon, CNN, eBay, Yahoo, and others. Not only did it make headlines for simultaneously hitting several big companies, but it led President Clinton to organize the first White House roundtable on cybersecurity. While these public hacks drew a lot of press, none of them was deeply impactful, nor did they directly influence national security issues outside of elevating the prominence of cyber within the national conscious writ large. The most concerning thing about them was the constant drumbeat of articles warning that more dangerous attacks were imminent and that it was only a matter of time before cyber-terrorists brought the nation to its knees.\nA major cyber-espionage case in early 2001 actually did have a significant impact on the DoD, though its effects came in the form of information compromise. A series of intrusions dubbed MOONLIGHT MAZE launched a high-profile, multi-year investigation and provided the first indication of a changing threat environment. The details are still classified but the incursions appeared to have begun in March 1998 and affected hundreds of computers at NASA, the Pentagon, other governmental agencies, private universities, and research labs. SOLAR SUNRISE was a scare, but this event became truly worrying for policymakers. They appeared to be the first major intrusions conducted by a nation-state, they lasted for several years with disturbingly few clues about who was behind them or what they were taking, and the government could not seem to stop them. Evidence suggested Russian actors targeting unclassified sensitive technical research matters, but the sparse details caused discomfort. Two years after the discovery, James Adams, a member of NSA's advisory board, characterized the attack to the Washington Post as ‘the most persistent and serious computer attack against # C. L. ROSS the United States to date'. He also stated that attacks continued unabated and had triggered the 'largest cyber-intelligence investigation ever'. Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre, ever on the lookout for a cyber conflict, allegedly told congressional colleagues, 'We're in the middle of a cyberwar'.\nUnfortunately, everything in the national security apparatus turned upside down when the fears about a massive terrorist attack against critical American facilities became reality on 11 September of that year. While it neither came via cyber means nor did it cripple America, it did drastically revector the nation's defence as it absorbed the shock of the attacks and gradually funnelled its response into the Global War on Terror. In a continuation of the trends of the previous half-decade, news articles in the weeks following the attacks continued to warn that cyberspace would likely provide the vector for the next big strike. The shock of September $11^{\\text{th}}$ further cemented a fear of massive surprise attacks from unknown dark forces in the American psyche.\n# Cyber authorities and the first cyber strategies As the United States began both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the concepts for cyber operations as a distinct military capability began to solidify and mature, enabling further development of authorities and strategies for operating in cyberspace. While cyber was increasingly talked about as something distinct from information warfare, the two were still deeply intertwined and often used interchangeably into the 2000s. That began to change in official policy in late 1996 but it took several years for the distinction to fully materialize. In then-classified DoD Directive S-3600.1, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White rechristened information warfare to information operations and, for the first time in official documents, defined computer network attack. However, as cyber gradually emerged from information warfare as a distinct capability, its development and maturation were directly influenced by the conceptions formed over the previous two decades.\nThe Bush Administration's attempts to provide increased clarity on authorities for cyber operations in the run-up to the war shed light on American leadership's conceptions of cyber at that point in time. The Washington Post reported that Bush signed the classified National Security Presidential Directive 16 (NSPD-16) in July of 2002 to provide the first national-level guidance on when and how the United States would launch cyber-attacks against an adversary.[73] Predictably, the article likened the development to 71Vernon Loeb, 'NSA Adviser Says Cyber-Assaults On Pentagon Persist With Few Clues', The Washington Post, 7 May 2001, https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nsa-adviser-says-cyber-assaults-on-pentagon/docview/409117447/se-2?accountid=4332.\n72We're in the Middle of a Cyberwar', Newsweek, 19 September 1999.\n73Bradley Graham, 'Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare', The Washington Post, 7 February 2003, https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-pr04/readings/week5/bush_guidelines..\nthe formulation of guidelines in the early days of nuclear weapons. However, the article also discussed how the administration and the DoD were still wrestling with some of the aspects of cyber conflict and whether it should be unleashed. According to the article, part of the hesitation to launch attacks stemmed from America's vulnerability to cyber and concerns about establishing a norm that could be used against the United States. Richard Clarke, who had recently resigned from his post as Special Advisor to the President on Cybersecurity, highlighted another concern when he said, ‘There also is an issue, frankly, that's similar to the strategic nuclear issue which is: Do you ever want to do it? Do you want to legitimize that kind of weaponry?' The article insightfully concluded by saying, ‘Given the newness of the weapons, their potential power and the uncertainty about how they would work, the Pentagon's Joint Staff has issued classified “rules of engagement” that strictly require top-level approval for any cyber-attack'.\nThe DoD's then-classified Information Operations Roadmap, released in October of 2003, provided additional insights into the insider discussions regarding cyber authorities as well as military conceptions of cyber operations. The roadmap maintained five components for information operations but it replaced physical destruction with Computer Network Operations (CNO). It also included several recommendations devoted to CNA and Computer Network Defence (CND). One notable recommendation was that United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM, the parent command for cyber operations at the time) classify CNA capabilities into more refined categories that could allow for differentiated levels of authority to use them. The roadmap proposed three categories of weapons: those that could be allocated to a combatant commander, those pre-allocated to support aspects of specified operational or contingency plans, and those that were not assigned to combatant commanders and therefore required Secretary or Presidential approval. Not only was it remarkable as the first attempt to distinguish between levels of cyber weapons, rather than merely thinking of cyber as a single capability, but it also demonstrated that the authority to use cyber-attack techniques would still be restricted to very high-levels. It highlighted how, even with a more refined understanding of cyber weaponization, there was still a significant reticence to use them.\nThe advancement of cyber operations as a distinct military element itself accelerated in the years that followed. After the 2004 National Military Strategy declared cyberspace a warfighting domain for the first time, the # C. L. ROSS JCS released the first-ever military strategy for cyber operations in 2006. The then-classified National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations presented a far more nuanced and robust understanding of the domain than previous unclassified doctrine or policy statements. It provided an updated definition for cyberspace along with a list of domain characteristics and key features that drove the strategy's development.[78] The only strategic end that has been declassified was the first one, which sought to deter adversaries 'from establishing or employing offensive capabilities against US interests in cyberspace'.[79] It is unclear if 'establishing' referred to preventing the development of cyber capabilities. If so, it would have been a lofty goal to say the least, as the low barrier to entry made it virtually impossible to stop. However, it would have mirrored concepts of nuclear non-proliferation, which seek to prevent nations from even developing nuclear weapons in the first place due to their destructive power. In pursuing deterrence by imposing costs, denying benefits, and 'inducing adversary restraint based on demonstrated US capabilities', the strategy ultimately echoed elements within existing nuclear deterrence theory.[80] Although defence and national security leadership matured their ideas and strategy concerning cyberspace in the early years of the Global War on Terror, it did not become a major personal focus for President George W. Bush until the end of his time in office. However, that changed with a meeting in April 2007. It appears that President Bush approved a covert action request within the first five minutes of what was supposed to be an hour-long meeting.[81] Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), took advantage of the newly-available fifty-five minutes to talk to the president about McConnell's concerns for national cyber defence – a major topic of anxiety for him. McConnell would later talk about cyber threats, specifically an attack against the financial industry or critical infrastructure, as one of the primary threats that kept him up at night.[82] His inclusion of cyber as a new weapon of mass destruction alongside nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the same interview clearly demonstrated how he thought about the threat from cyber operations.[83] McConnell used the time with 78Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Military Strategy of Cyberspace Operations, December 2006. This document is now partially declassified. https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/21419-document-23 79Ibid., 13.\n80Ibid.\n81Details about the meeting's content come primarily from secondary sources. In Playing to the Edge, Hayden provided the only primary source material when he specifically credited DNI McConnell with selling Bush on the 'immediacy of the cyber threat and convinced him to launch the CNCI', 177. Kaplan's Dark Territory includes a more in-depth telling of events based on his interviews of unknown members, 174-178. Clarke's Cyber War provides fewer details than Kaplan but they largely agree with Kaplan's narrative, 114.\n82Mike McConnell, interview by Charlie Rose, The Charlie Rose Show, PBS, 8 January 2009. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Speeches%20and%20Interviews/20090108_interview.pdf 83Ibid.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # the President to highlight many of the previous decade's findings about America's vulnerability to cyber-attacks as well as its potential for strategic impact on national security. To punctuate his point to Bush, McConnell purportedly told the president that if Al Qaeda had been smarter, they would have launched a cyber-attack against a major bank in New York City and corrupted the files, which would have caused more economic damage than the attack on the Twin Towers.[84] The discussion apparently lit a fire under the president and he directed McConnell to quickly produce a solution.[85] When McConnell later told the president that the plan would be expensive, Bush allegedly said that he was willing to spend as much as had been spent on the Manhattan Project to work towards solutions.[86] The result was the then-classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative as outlined in NSPD-54 Cybersecurity Policy. The initiative sought to improve the defence of government systems as well as those critical to national security, national economic security, or public health and safety.[87] While the funding details are not clear, it was reported to include tens of billions of dollars, which demonstrated the administration's level of concern over the issue.[88] The initiative was rebranded by the incoming Obama administration but largely kept the same structure. The growing conceptions regarding both the threats and opportunities of cyber operations eventually led Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to approve the stand-up of a combatant command dedicated to the domain of cyberspace the following year.[89] # Conclusion The historical development of cyber within the United States leading up to the creation of USCYBERCOM demonstrates several recurring themes that shaped national and defence leaders' conceptions about cyber operations. The first theme is that cyber operations were birthed in strategic applications. They were first introduced to disrupt and defeat Soviet nuclear forces and their command and control. Those concepts were later applied against Iraqi leadership in Desert Storm with smashing success. The desire to replicate such a definitive victory in future conflicts spawned two subsequent decades 84Kaplan, Dark Territory, 174.\n85Kaplan's Dark Territory records Bush saying he wanted a solution in thirty days, 175, while Clarke's Cyber War quoted him saying, 'I want a plan, soon, real soon', 114.\n86Kaplan, Dark Territory, 178.\n87National Security Presidential Directive, 54, Cybersecurity Policy, 8 January 2008, 4. https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-54.pdf. This document is now partially declassified.\n88Kaplan's Dark Territory reported the administration requested $18B over five years, 178. Clarke's Cyber War pegged the number at $50B over five years. Others reported $3.6B alone allocated to it in 2011, see Eric Chabrow, 'CNCI Budget Request Set at $3.6 Billion', GovInfoSecurity, 2 February 2010, https://www.govinfosecurity.com/cnci-budget-request-set-at-36-billion-a-2151.\n89Robert Gates, Duty (New York City NY: Alfred A. Knopf 2014), 193-4.\nof evolving thought over how to quickly win wars by using information and computers to cripple adversary leadership and their strategic systems.\nThe second theme is that leaders increasingly feared the potential of a cyber attack against critical infrastructure. The growing interconnectivity of vital data, networks, and infrastructure meant that those elements were becoming progressively more vulnerable to cyber threats. The strategic nature of those targets meant that cyber operations could theoretically have strategic impacts on critical societal and warfighting functions, which dominated senior leaders' thinking about the threat. Early advocates regularly used the doomsday possibility of a ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage.\nThe final theme is that early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives concentrated on nuclear war and high-profile terrorism, and it became easily interwoven with both. Computers and the internet were exciting and novel technologies to the majority of Americans during the early days of cyber, including senior leaders, but few understood much about how either computers or the internet worked. However, they were regularly told that a teenager with a computer bought at RadioShack could now cause disruption on the scale of nuclear weapons. Additionally, most of the cyber-attacks they read about in the news came from mischievous individuals as bolts out of the blue. Cyber operations were thus easily linked in the minds of senior leaders to the leading security issues of the times -- nuclear weapons and high-profile terrorism.\nUntil further information is declassified regarding cyber operations that occurred during the time period, it will be impossible to fully assess how much the rhetoric matched reality. Still, the context within which strategic thought develops influences the direction that it will go. Although obvious when stated, it is a truism that strategists and leaders neglect at their own peril. The context surrounding the development of thought regarding cyberspace in America affected the frameworks, authorities, and operations that leaders applied to the domain, potentially to the benefit and detriment of national security. Fears of a cyber Pearl Harbor enabled advocates to garner attention and resources for cyber issues. However, the focus on catastrophic attacks led to an underappreciation of how a campaign of individually inconsequential events can shape geopolitical contexts towards favourable ends. Early intrusions by computer-savvy teenagers highlighted the insecure nature of networks and facilitated the initial development of cybersecurity. Yet they also created unrealistic expectations in leaders about how easy it would be for future cyber operators to create on-order effects against hard targets. Describing cyber-attacks as moving at the speed of light and capable of reaching anywhere in the networked world helped leaders to understand the potential of cyber operations. But it also downplayed the intense time and work required to locate a desired network, gain access, understand the environment, and then develop capabilities to achieve specific and predictable effects. The true impact or validity of these conceptions can only be fully determined once more information becomes available. However, they serve as a reminder to leaders about the need to continuously examine the assumptions and reasoning from which they are operating -- always seeking to validate or disprove them -- to ensure that their cognitive frameworks best reflect reality as it is.\n## Acknowledgments The author would like to thank C.

Ross\nSchriever Space Scholars, Air Command and Staff College, Montgomery, AL, USA\n# ABSTRACT\nFuturist depictions of cyber-attacks in coming wars often portray them as bolts out of the blue that will cause immense damage to a nation's warfighting capacity and create chaos among its populace by crippling its essential services. However, those depictions are based more on prophecy than they are on historical realities. The historical development of conceptions about cyber operations explains how those themes came to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States. Rather than being self-evident, the themes are a result of the application of early cyber efforts to strategic operations, advocacy that focused on doomsday scenarios to draw attention to cybersecurity problems, and the ease with which cyber threats were tied to the primary strategic narratives of American national security during their development.\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 September 2022; Accepted 18 November 2023\nKEYWORDS Cyber; Pearl Harbor; cybersecurity; information warfare; information operations; cyberspace; future war\n# Introduction\nIn his 2011 book Cyber War, Richard Clarke, the former Special Advisor to the President for Cybersecurity, outlined a fictional depiction of a full-scale cyber war in America. His scenario began with the White House Situation Room receiving a message from the National Security Agency (NSA) about multiple malware targeting critical infrastructure before the desk officer subsequently becomes bombarded with messages about systems failing across the country. Department of Defense networks go offline, gas refineries explode in multiple major cities, chemical plants leak poisonous gas into the environment, aeroplanes collide in mid-air after air traffic control centres lose their air picture, and rail traffic ceased due to trains and subways derailing at key junction points. Within a manner of minutes, national power grids are taken offline and the financial system is locked up by the disappearance of\nCONTACT Cameron L.

Americans panic and looting ensues as a result of the breakdown of essential services in the days that follow, which completely overwhelms the police and emergency services. He concluded by saying that 'A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country'.\nWhile notable for the exceedingly grim nature of his prediction, it is largely consistent with the chorus of prognostications regarding the impact that cyber operations will play in the future. As Andy Greenberg at Wired puts it, 'The threat of cyberwar looms over the future: a new dimension of conflict capable of leapfrogging borders and teleporting the chaos of war to civilians thousands of miles beyond its front'. Fiction literature about the future of war is riddled with these themes. Ghost Fleet, a novel by political scientist and futurist P. W. Singer, details a Chinese surprise attack against the United States that largely succeeds due to crippling cyber-attacks against American weapon systems and infrastructure. Similarly, Admiral James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman's novel 2034 includes cyber-attacks that cause national power blackouts and government computer lockouts, while also disabling fighter aircraft and naval vessels across the globe. The themes are not unique to fictional stories though – indeed, the authors included those elements in the plotlines precisely because they capture the fears of policymakers in the real world. Testifying before Congress in 2011, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta talked about how the next Pearl Harbor-type attack likely could come from a cyber-attack. 'If you have a cyber-attack that brings down our power-grid system, brings down our financial system, brings down our government systems, you could paralyze this country ... And I think that's a real potential'. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, echoed the sentiment and said that the threat from cyber operations 'is increasing in scope and scale, and its impact is difficult to overstate'.\nInterestingly, these images of cyber operations seem to be grounded in prophesy rather than historical realities. While cyber has become associated with the image of a catastrophic surprise attack, the history of cyber-attacks has been dominated by the less dramatic elements of espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Likewise, the strategic state conflicts that have included cyber elements did not include surprise cyber-attacks. Instead, they took place in larger geopolitical conflicts that offered ample warning time for\n1Richard A. Clarke, Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It (New York, NY: Harper Collins 2010), 67.\n2Jason Ryan, 'CIA Director Leon Panetta Warns of Possible Cyber-Pearl Harbor', ABC News, 10 February 2011, https://abcnews.go.com/News/cia-director-leon-panetta-warns-cyber-pearl-harbor/story?id=12888905.\n3Ibid.\n#\nC. L. ROSS\ndefenders. $^{4}$  Moreover, the assumptions about the fragility of modern interconnected societies that underpin these themes have largely gone unquestioned despite the fact that similar assumptions about the effects of strategic bombing proved questionable in the Second World War. $^{5}$  Strategic bombing failed to break German or Japanese will and economies proved far more resilient than air-power proponents believed, yet many readily assume that massive cyber-attacks today would succeed where millions of tons of high explosives could not. The question becomes, how have these themes come to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States?\nUnfortunately, little work has been done to understand the historical development of cyber thinking. In fact, literature on the history of cyber operations in general is rather sparse. Fred Kaplan's Dark Territory is perhaps the most well-known work, but as a journalist writing for a popular audience, it does not provide many details regarding its source material. The Atlantic Council's A Fierce Domain, edited by Jason Healey, is the best scholarly work. It provides a general background but its primary focus is several case studies documenting specific cyber events. USCYBERCOM's historian, Michael Warner, has also written a number of useful articles on the history of cyber operations. However, even fewer authors have explored the intellectual and cultural history of cyber thinking. Thomas Rid's Cyber War Will Not Take Place includes historical case studies and makes an argument that cyber operations should not be considered a form of warfare, but he does not fully trace how contemporaries considered them, how those conceptions changed over time, nor what factors influenced those changes. His Rise of the Machines provides a rich history of the ideas and field of cybernetics, which tangentially relates to cyber operations, but it does not examine the idea of cyber operations directly. Sarah White's recent doctoral thesis titled Subcultural Influences on Military Innovation: The Development of U.S. Military Cyber Doctrine comes closest to documenting the progression of thought, but it more specifically explores the influence of service culture and operational experience on military approaches to new technologies.\nYet understanding that historical development is vitally important. Charting the history of conceptions about cyber operations provides critical insights into how the current images of cyber rose to such prominence in the American psyche. The ideas were not self-evident but instead were formed and framed by several cultural, social, political, and military factors and events. Understanding the evolution of those conceptions is also no mere\n4Jason Healey, 'A Brief History of US Cyber Conflict', in Jason Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain (Washington DC: Cyber Conflict Studies Association 2013), 17.\n5For a great historical study of the conceptual development of strategic bombing and the impact those conceptions had in the employment of bombers in World War II, see Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press 2004).\nintellectual exercise -- ideas influence action, policy, and strategy, and incorrect ideas can lead to disastrous results. Moreover, knowing the assumptions and reasoning that underpinned the early development of strategic thinking can facilitate more thoughtful policy and strategy in the future. Outlining the flow of ideas from previous generations enables leaders and policymakers to better assess their own assumptions and reasoning as they wrestle with current and future challenges.\nIn examining the historical development of American strategic thought regarding cyber operations, three major themes influenced how cyber was conceived leading up to the creation of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009. First, initial cyber capability development in the United States occurred in the context of strategic operations. The primary targets for initial cyber operations, the impact they sought to produce, and the problems they tried to solve all centred around nuclear operations or strategic leadership decision-making. Second, the increasing interconnectivity of critical data and infrastructure meant that cyber operations could theoretically have massive impacts on the economy and national security. Early advocates regularly focused on these doomsday possibilities in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage. Finally, early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives regarding nuclear war and high-profile terrorism. The potential impact and low barrier of entry of cyber operations made it easy for senior leaders to associate cyber with those strategic narratives. These three threads emerge as the most formative themes in the development of conceptions about cyber, and they led senior leaders to view cyber capabilities as strategic weapons capable of impacts on par with weapons of mass destruction.\n## A note on definitions\nProviding clear and unified definitions for cyber and cyberspace is a recurring struggle and theme of the history of military cyber efforts. Definitions for terms like cyberspace, cyber operations, information warfare, command and control warfare, and others have evolved throughout time. As such, it is difficult to use terms consistently throughout the article, particularly because there was significant overlap between the various terms and they were used almost synonymously during certain periods of time. However, the intent is to understand how cyberspace and cyber operations came to be understood as they are today.\nSince 2008, joint doctrine has defined cyberspace as ‘A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet,\n#\nC. L. ROSS\ntelecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'.6 Thus, cyber operations are plainly defined as 'The employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace'.7 While individuals, organizations, and military services have emphasized particular aspects in their use of the term cyber (for example the networks, the information, the electromagnetic spectrum, etc.), I intend the terms 'cyber' and 'cyber operations' to synonymously capture the imprecise ideas that American national security professionals commonly mean when they discuss the terms today, which broadly centre around concepts of computer hacking. Essentially, they refer to operations that disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, along with operations taken to prevent others from doing the same. When military members talk of using 'cyber' to disrupt an integrated air defence system, suggest that the next war will begin with 'cyber', or talk of a 'cyber' officer, they are typically referring to cyber as a distinct military capability that includes using a computer system to achieve some effect on another computer system or its information, while also trying to prevent the same from occurring on one's own systems. It is in that sense that I use the terms cyber and cyber operations.\n# Cyber precursors\nDisrupting an adversary's communications, information warfare, and using the electromagnetic spectrum to achieve objectives are not new phenomena. However, the march towards the modern version of conflict within cyberspace began because of two trends in the latter half of the  $21^{\\text{st}}$  century. First, the exponential growth of electrical computing technology and its proliferation within the security apparatus increasingly presented the possibility of exploitation by adversaries. Second, the movement towards storing and transporting wealth and secrets in digital data, along with the growth of strategic systems reliant on computers and networking, produced growing motivation for adversaries to take advantage of those possibilities. Together, these trends gradually produced and elevated cyber-related issues as concerns for national security.\nAlmost from the very beginning of the digital revolution, analysts identified inherent security issues with the explosion of digital technology in the\n^{6}\nUnited States Air Force, Air Force Doctrine Publications 3-12 - Cyberspace Operations (Washington DC 2023), 6, https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/AFDP_3-12/3-12-AFDP-CYBERSPACE-OPS.pdf.\n^{7}\nDepartment of Defense, United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms (Washington DC: Department of Defense 2019), 233.\n8Michael Warner, 'A Brief History of Cyber Conflict', in Schneider et al.

Thomas Rona, a Boeing advisor to the Secretary of Defense's Office of Net Assessment, wrote a paper in 1976 titled 'Weapon Systems and Information War' that wrestled with the challenges introduced by the information age. He noted that the growing complexity of weapon systems meant that they were increasingly dependent upon external information sources for successful engagements, whether it be intelligence, targeting information, or command and control orders. That dependency created the possibility that weapon systems could be defeated through information denial. Of course, these changes produced both opportunities and vulnerabilities – information warfare could cut both ways. The United States needed to consider how to attack an adversary's information flow as well as how it would protect its own. While his report focused on information warfare predominantly as a means to defeat weapon systems, Rona recognized that there were broader implications and opportunities for strategic warfare.\nWhile Rona looked at information warfare broadly applied to weapons, others focused more specifically on the threat to command and control. As computers became more integrated with the control and employment of force, military members increasingly regarded them as critical assets that required defending as well as potential targets that could be exploited. A 1976 Defense Science Board study on conventional force counters to a Warsaw Pact attack highlighted how disruption of Soviet troop control systems could serve as a critical counterbalance to their numerical superiority. As American awareness subsequently grew regarding Soviet reliance on a tightly controlled and automated system for directing their forces, the military increasingly viewed attacks on the Soviet command and control structure as vital force multipliers. Consequently, the Department of Defense (DoD) began developing a set of doctrinal ideas eventually known as command-and-control warfare (C2W) in 1979 in an effort to negate the numerical advantage of Soviet forces. C2W concepts became highly intertwined with those of information warfare over the next two decades, and both served as the cocoon within which military conceptions of cyber operations initially developed.\nThe increasing digitization also produced greater overlap with signals intelligence techniques. While traditional communications collection relied on intercepting analog signals transmitted on telephone lines or broadcast over the air, digital signals required more robust processing to break out the data and information. The National Security Agency (NSA) and signals\nIt's Col Evan H. Parrott, 'C3CM: Theory, Application, and Process', Research Report, February (Maxwell Air Force Base: Air War College 1983), 14.\nintelligence organizations in the military were on the front lines of this new frontier since they led the effort to discover and collect adversary command and control information. Thus, they were also optimally positioned to be able to manipulate that information or the systems they resided within.\nAs signals intelligence produced greater access into Soviet systems, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought to operationalize them in 1982 through a little-known organization called the Joint Special Studies Group. According to Bruce Berkowitz, the purpose of JSSG was to ‘determine whether vulnerabilities identified from critical node analysis, such as message intercepts, jamming, and signals injection into adversary networks, could be turned into a military or intelligence capability'. The goal was to find ways to affect their automated command and control network or to sow doubts about the integrity of the information in the minds of Soviet leaders. By 1984 though, policymakers, including President Ronald Reagan, began to get concerned about the ability to control the effects of information warfare techniques, especially since they were directed toward strategic Soviet systems and could create considerable problems if they went awry. In the end, while the JSSG was able to model Soviet nuclear communication networks, they never discovered a silver bullet to guarantee disruption of communications, and the program was shut down in 1989 with the end of the Cold War. However, their concepts served as major forerunners to Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA).\nJust as the Joint Chiefs were standing up the JSSG, elements within pop culture began to use hacking-related themes that impacted national security in surprising ways. The 1983 film WarGames starring Matthew Broderick initiated several governmental actions regarding computer security and created enduring conceptions of the cyber threat. The movie details a teenage hacker who almost starts a global nuclear war when he accidentally hacks into a supercomputer at NORAD. In June of 1983, Reagan watched the film while on retreat at Camp David and he proceeded to discuss the plot with members of Congress as well as his national security staff. According to journalist Fred Kaplan, Reagan's inquiries into whether the film's plot could play out in real life led him to discover that the threat of computer intrusion was even worse than he imagined. The subsequent string of events ultimately led to the confidential National Security Decision Directive 145 (NSDD-\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\n145), titled National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security. $^{19}$  It served as the first time that presidential policy addressed what would later become aspects of cyber operations and it originated over concerns about cyber actions leading to nuclear conflict.\nThe President was not the only one concerned about the feasibility of the plot – American media organizations anxiously questioned governmental officials about it following the release of the film. The three major television networks ran a flurry of reports about computer and networking technology using WarGames as a framework for understanding their inherent dangers. Also, much of the reporting discussed it in the context of nuclear war. A four-minute clip from the movie was shown at the opening of congressional hearings on computer security and representatives referenced the film throughout the hearings to help members conceptualize the threat. Ultimately, those hearings led to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984. Not only did the film enable both Presidential and Congressional action, but the movie also popularized the impression that hacking was the realm of anti-establishment teenagers and a potential weapon for global destruction. Those conceptions provided a powerful framing effect for subsequent cyber events.\n# The Morris worm and Desert Storm\nOnly a couple of years later, a real-world event both resonated with and evolved those conceptions. In November 1988, Robert T. Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell graduate student, released a worm onto the NSFNet, a precursor to the internet, from a remotely-accessed computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The worm did not cause any damage to systems or data but within a manner of hours it had infected up to  $10\\%$  of the network.

L. ROSS\nconvey the impact that the Morris worm had on the psyche of both the computer community and the nation writ large. While many researchers understood that networks and computers were vulnerable, the speed with which the virus spread across such extensive networks gave them a queasy feeling that they had experienced a close call. A few simple alterations would have enabled the worm to destroy massive amounts of data or compromise large portions of sensitive research and defence information. The ease and rapidity of its spread led pundits and officials to begin to ask about the vulnerability of other computer networks that business and infrastructure increasingly depended on. If a single individual could achieve such widespread effects, what could an individual do if they targeted systems associated with national security?\nUnsurprisingly, the event helped reinforce the early image of the malicious individual as the primary threat in cyberspace. While numerous news articles noted that the worm served as a giant wake-up call, the threat was commonly framed as one from hackers and terrorists as opposed to nation states or militaries. That image was fortified by Dutch teenagers hacking into 34 American military installation networks between 1990–91, and young British hackers accessing networks at the Air Force's Rome Labs before routing through to a South Korean nuclear institute in 1994. Policymakers increasingly worried about the impact well-resourced and determined individuals could have if teenagers were able to access such a wide swath of computers. Computer security expert Winn Schwartau did little to abate those fears when he testified in congress in 1991 that governmental and commercial systems were essentially defenceless and an 'electronic Pearl Harbor' was waiting to happen. As early as the late 1980s, conceptions about cyber threats as primarily coming from malignant individuals and capable of devastating impact were already front and centre in the national dialogue about cyber.\nJust as Morris was going to trial, President George H. W. Bush ordered the bombardment of Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In a manner of weeks, the United States defeated a battle-hardened\n26Peter J.

The coalition paralyzed Iraq's command and control infrastructure in the first hours of the attack, leaving Hussein and senior leaders blind, deaf, dumb, and deceived. $^{31}$  The Iraqi disorder was juxtaposed against the highly networked and synchronized United States military. Many American defence experts concluded that the resulting information differential proved critical to the subsequent speed and ease with which America and its allies routed Iraqi forces. $^{32}$  As a result, the victory shoved thinking about information warfare into overdrive among the defence community. As military thinkers sought to understand the roots of the success in order to replicate it in the future, many concluded that information warfare was the secret weapon for quick and decisive victories going forward.\nThe DoD quickly directed the services to organize and train for information warfare in then-classified DoD Directive 3600.1 (DODD TS-3600.1), titled Information Warfare and released in December 1992. It served as the first indication that elements of modern-day cyber were entering the official policy of the military. The Department formally defined information warfare as\nthe competition of opposing information systems to include the exploitation, corruption, or destruction of an adversary's information systems through such means as signals intelligence and command and control countermeasures while protecting the integrity of one's own information systems from such attacks. The objective of information warfare is to attain a significant enough information advantage to enable the force overall to predominate and to do so quickly.\nThe directive essentially tied together many of the related concepts the military had been experimenting with in the previous two decades. It combined the signals-intelligence-enabled precursors to cyber operations, which the military created to counter Soviet nuclear command and control, with the broader C2W ideas developed prior to and then used in Desert Storm. And it was all with the intent of replicating the speed and success of the Gulf War in future conflicts. While the directive served as the introduction of information warfare into defence policy, it was only the beginning, as the post-war period spawned a flurry of ideas and thinking about information warfare from which cyber would later emerge.\n31 Alan D.

ROSS\nThe sense of change and evolution presented by the digital revolution and Desert Storm was only magnified by the unexpected end of the Cold War. The pacing threat for the previous four decades suddenly disappeared and America found itself the lone superpower on the world stage. The vacuum created by the dissolution of the USSR was quickly filled by a focus on high-profile terrorism. As the Soviet empire collapsed, the threat of Soviet nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue nations became a palpable fear for national leadership. The rise of high-profile terrorism as the most pressing security issue of the new century had a direct effect on the development of strategic thinking about cyberspace for the next two decades.\n# Terrorism and cyber Pearl Harbors\nPresident William Clinton's administration became the first to systematically deal with the issue of terrorism as it faced several terrorist attacks in the first years of his presidency. However, it was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that proved most impactful on the president and for cyber operations. The bombing moved him personally, and it led him to wonder about the threat terrorists could pose to more strategic or symbolic locations throughout the country. Through a number of subsequent events, he eventually appointed a Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (later known as the Marsh Commission after its lead, John Marsh) to investigate the vulnerability of important facilities to terrorist attacks.\nThe release of the commission's final report in October of 1997 surprised many by focusing primarily on cyber threats as opposed to traditional physical attacks. The commission noted that all critical infrastructure was dependent on unsecure information technology. While the commission did not find evidence of impending cyber-attacks, it did discover widespread capabilities to exploit infrastructure vulnerabilities. Further, because the commission was created primarily to consider terrorist threats, it largely described the threat from cyber as coming from terrorists and criminals vice nation-state actors. The report never explicitly compared cyber to nuclear weapons but, as with much of the contemporaneous literature, cyber threats were mentioned in the same context as terrorists using weapons of mass destruction.\n34George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 (Oxford UK: Oxford University Press 2011), 920.\n35Ibid., 936.\n36Clarke, Cyber War, 106.\n37Critical infrastructure examined in the report included transportation, oil and gas, water, emergency services, government services, banking and finance, electrical power, and telecommunications. See Robert T. Marsh, 'Critical Foundations: Protecting America's Infrastructures', The Report of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 13 October (Washington DC: 1997), 3-4.\n38Ibid., i.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nWhile the possibility of chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists adds a new and frightening dimension to physical attacks, such weapons are difficult to acquire. In contrast ... a personal computer and a telephone connection to an Internet Service Provider anywhere in the world are enough to cause harm'.39 In reality, the cyber threat from terrorists would largely prove non-existent over the next twenty-five years.40 However, the report's focus on the devastation that a cyber-attack could cause to highly-vulnerable critical infrastructure, and its concentration on terrorists as the primary threat actors, further solidified conceptions of cyber-attacks as catastrophic surprise attacks that were launched by malignant individuals.\nThe urgent tone of the report was underscored by several prominent events that occurred within a couple of years of its release. In June 1997, the JCS launched a no-notice exercise known as ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 97 to test the cyber defences of DoD networks and critical infrastructure. The exercise was the brainchild of NSA Director Lt Gen Kenneth Minihan, who was frustrated at how little the DoD accounted for the threats or opportunities cyber presented in his previous years leading Air Force cyber operations. Thirty-five NSA red-team hackers split into two teams—one in the United States and one on a ship in the Pacific. Armed with no inside information, and using only store-bought computers and hacking tools downloaded from the internet, they proceeded to run rampant through networks leaving marker files to prove where they had been. According to Kaplan's interviews, the portion of the exercise devoted to national infrastructure attacks was a tabletop exercise without real-world intrusions. However, the attackers were actually allowed to penetrate defence networks for the other portion. In doing so, they were able to access the National Military Command Center, send false emails, reformat hard drives, alter communications, shut down phone lines, and sow doubt into command and control – much of what C2W and information warfare had envisioned throughout the preceding decade. John Campbell, the Major General in charge of information operations on the Joint Staff, put it bluntly when he said, ‘... frankly it scared the hell out of a lot of folks because the implications of what this team had been able to do were pretty far-reaching’. DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that it had ‘succeeded beyond its planner’s wildest dreams in elevating the awareness of threats to our computer systems’. It shocked DoD Deputy\n39Ibid., x.\n40While terrorists have relied heavily on the internet for recruiting, communications, and fundraising, there have been no major cyber-attacks or intrusions from terrorists; see Healey, Fierce Domain, 64.\n41Kaplan, Dark Territory, 64.\n42Healey, Fierce Domain, 42.\n43Kaplan, Dark Territory, 69-70.\n44John Campbell, 'Lessons from Our Cyber Past, The First Military Cyber Units', in Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain, 56.\n45Warner, 'Cybersecurity', 797.\n#\nC. L. ROSS\nSecretary and previous sceptic John Hamre, who later said that it showed 'This country is wide open to attack electronically ... We didn't really let them take down the power system in the country, but we made them prove they knew how to do it'.46 ELIGIBLE RECEIVER provided a vivid example to policymakers of what the Marsh Commission had discussed only in hypotheticals, and it magnified the threat of information warfare to senior leaders on the Joint Staff.\nWhile the DoD was still processing the lessons learned from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, the Department experienced a series of intrusions in February 1998 dubbed SOLAR SUNRISE that sparked fears of the beginning of a real-world cyber war. Hamre, with the previous exercise fresh on his mind, notified the President early in the intrusions and said that the incident 'might be the first shots of a genuine cyber war, perhaps by Iraq'. At the time, tensions were particularly high over Iraq's lack of cooperation with United Nations inspectors regarding its weapons of mass destruction program. Several intrusions were traced to the Middle East, leading many to believe Iraqi involvement. It proved to be an embarrassing example of the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace, as it turned out to be the work of California teenagers aided by an Israeli mentor. Hamre later called it 'the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date', and it emotionally underlined leaders' previous fears from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER and the Marsh Commission, even though it ultimately had little impact.\nIt was in the environment of these prominent events that the Pearl Harbor analogy gained significant steam as officials tried to grow awareness of cyber threats. In the events that led to the Marsh Commission, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified to Congress, 'There is a present threat ... We have not yet had a terrorist cyber-attack on the infrastructure. But I think that that is just a matter of time. We do not need to wait for the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor before we wake up to the threat and take steps to confront it'. Senator Sam Nunn, who led the Congressional hearings, later said that the two most significant dangers America faced were terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons and a cyber Pearl Harbor. In other hearings,\n46John J.

In a late 1998 press conference, he commented that ‘The threat of an electronic Pearl Harbor or the threat of cyber-terrorism . . . is clearly one that’s getting increasing attention in this building and throughout the government’.53\nDespite the chorus of predictions about cyber doomsday, some cautioned against the comparison. They noted that an attacker would need significant knowledge of the operating systems, hardware, and networks, as well as the interaction between all of those components, to create the systemic effects that experts warned about. The primary threat for that level of attack would more likely arise from a dedicated team of professionals employed by a nation-state. Thus, an attack would likely take place in a specific geopolitical context rather than being a bolt out of the blue.54 Nevertheless, the analogy became very popular and continued to gain steam over the next twenty years in sounding the alarm over cyber threats.\n## Increasing cyber awareness\nThe inclusion of cyber threats in the National Security Strategies (NSS) during this period further reflected the government’s growing acceptance of the role of cyber in security issues. The 1997 NSS was the first to allude to cyber when it commented on technology making transnational threats more potent than before.55 It also included the first NSS comment – albeit a minor one – on the need to protect critical infrastructure from intrusion.56 The next NSS in 1999 indicated how much cyber thought advanced from the events of the intervening years. Defending critical infrastructure from paralyzing attacks was added to the list of vital national interests, alongside protecting the nation’s territory, citizens, allies, and economic well-being.57 In the large portions devoted to infrastructure, it focused heavily on the threats from cyberspace. As with other documents of the era, cyber-attacks were included in the list of technology advancements, along with weapons of mass destruction, that enabled terrorists or rogue nations to pose a greater risk than before. However, the awareness of cyber threats did not solely apply to\n52 David Perera, ‘Stop Saying “Cyber Pearl Harbor”’, *Fierce Government IT*, 13 June 2012, https://web.archive.org/web/20120617204335/http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/stop-saying-cyber-pearl-harbor/2012-06-13.\n53 Ibid.\n54 George Smith, ‘An Electronic Pearl Harbor?

L. ROSS\ninfrastructure. The 1999 NSS was also the first to discuss the importance of information superiority to military readiness and command and control.\nThe inclusion of information superiority in the NSS was a manifestation of the DoD's growing concern about information warfare throughout the period. The ongoing defence dialogue on information warfare adapted to and folded in many of the same insights and ideas that the Marsh Commission, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, and the SOLAR SUNRISE intrusions identified. Other internal studies and exercises only added to the concerns. Recognizing that the growth of cyberspace would profoundly impact national security, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a series of exercises on information warfare in 1996 to help develop a national information warfare strategy. Their report identified that much of national infrastructure (what the Marsh Commission would later include in critical infrastructure) was connected to the internet and attacks on such would take on a strategic aspect. Thus, they framed the challenge as 'strategic information warfare'. The more their participants became aware of information warfare's possibilities in the exercises, the more fearful they became of the impacts it could have. Only a couple of months later, the General Accounting Office warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the problems plaguing the civilian internet were increasingly threatening DoD information systems. They reported that 'The potential for catastrophic damage is great. Organized foreign nationals or terrorists could use \"information warfare\" techniques to disrupt military operations by harming command and control systems, the public switch network, and other systems or networks Defense relies on'. Further, a report from the Defense Science Board Task Force on Information Warfare Defense in November of 1996 stated that cyberspace threats to infrastructure created 'a tunnel of vulnerability previously unrealized in the history of conflict'. The possibilities of information warfare became increasingly dire the more military leaders considered it.\nThe arrival of the new century brought more high-profile cyber issues and they too were accompanied by a continual chorus of fears about cyber destruction. The year 2000 itself created significant concern in the computer community over the potential impacts it would have on how computers\n58Ibid., 12.\n59Roger C. Molander, Andrew S. Riddle and Peter A.

There was widespread concern at the time that power, transportation, banking, and other critical systems would fail at midnight and cause the extensive panic envisioned in the cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios. Several internet worms also garnered significant attention around the same time. ILOVEYOU, Melissa, Code Red, NIMDA, SQL Slammer, and others captured headlines and the awareness of Americans. In February of 2000, a 16-year-old Canadian used a program downloaded off the internet to conduct a distributed-denial-of-service attack against Amazon, CNN, eBay, Yahoo, and others. Not only did it make headlines for simultaneously hitting several big companies, but it led President Clinton to organize the first White House roundtable on cybersecurity. While these public hacks drew a lot of press, none of them was deeply impactful, nor did they directly influence national security issues outside of elevating the prominence of cyber within the national conscious writ large. The most concerning thing about them was the constant drumbeat of articles warning that more dangerous attacks were imminent and that it was only a matter of time before cyber-terrorists brought the nation to its knees.\nA major cyber-espionage case in early 2001 actually did have a significant impact on the DoD, though its effects came in the form of information compromise. A series of intrusions dubbed MOONLIGHT MAZE launched a high-profile, multi-year investigation and provided the first indication of a changing threat environment. The details are still classified but the incursions appeared to have begun in March 1998 and affected hundreds of computers at NASA, the Pentagon, other governmental agencies, private universities, and research labs. SOLAR SUNRISE was a scare, but this event became truly worrying for policymakers. They appeared to be the first major intrusions conducted by a nation-state, they lasted for several years with disturbingly few clues about who was behind them or what they were taking, and the government could not seem to stop them. Evidence suggested Russian actors targeting unclassified sensitive technical research matters, but the sparse details caused discomfort. Two years after the discovery, James Adams, a member of NSA's advisory board, characterized the attack to the Washington Post as ‘the most persistent and serious computer attack against\n#\nC. L. ROSS\nthe United States to date'. He also stated that attacks continued unabated and had triggered the 'largest cyber-intelligence investigation ever'. Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre, ever on the lookout for a cyber conflict, allegedly told congressional colleagues, 'We're in the middle of a cyberwar'.\nUnfortunately, everything in the national security apparatus turned upside down when the fears about a massive terrorist attack against critical American facilities became reality on 11 September of that year. While it neither came via cyber means nor did it cripple America, it did drastically revector the nation's defence as it absorbed the shock of the attacks and gradually funnelled its response into the Global War on Terror. In a continuation of the trends of the previous half-decade, news articles in the weeks following the attacks continued to warn that cyberspace would likely provide the vector for the next big strike. The shock of September  $11^{\\text{th}}$  further cemented a fear of massive surprise attacks from unknown dark forces in the American psyche.\n# Cyber authorities and the first cyber strategies\nAs the United States began both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the concepts for cyber operations as a distinct military capability began to solidify and mature, enabling further development of authorities and strategies for operating in cyberspace. While cyber was increasingly talked about as something distinct from information warfare, the two were still deeply intertwined and often used interchangeably into the 2000s. That began to change in official policy in late 1996 but it took several years for the distinction to fully materialize. In then-classified DoD Directive S-3600.1, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White rechristened information warfare to information operations and, for the first time in official documents, defined computer network attack. However, as cyber gradually emerged from information warfare as a distinct capability, its development and maturation were directly influenced by the conceptions formed over the previous two decades.\nThe Bush Administration's attempts to provide increased clarity on authorities for cyber operations in the run-up to the war shed light on American leadership's conceptions of cyber at that point in time. The Washington Post reported that Bush signed the classified National Security Presidential Directive 16 (NSPD-16) in July of 2002 to provide the first national-level guidance on when and how the United States would launch cyber-attacks against an adversary. Predictably, the article likened the development to\n71Vernon Loeb, 'NSA Adviser Says Cyber-Assaults On Pentagon Persist With Few Clues', The Washington Post, 7 May 2001, https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nsa-adviser-says-cyber-assaults-on-pentagon/docview/409117447/se-2?accountid=4332.\n72We're in the Middle of a Cyberwar', Newsweek, 19 September 1999.\n73Bradley Graham, 'Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare', The Washington Post, 7 February 2003, https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-pr04/readings/week5/bush_guidelines..\nthe formulation of guidelines in the early days of nuclear weapons. However, the article also discussed how the administration and the DoD were still wrestling with some of the aspects of cyber conflict and whether it should be unleashed. According to the article, part of the hesitation to launch attacks stemmed from America's vulnerability to cyber and concerns about establishing a norm that could be used against the United States. Richard Clarke, who had recently resigned from his post as Special Advisor to the President on Cybersecurity, highlighted another concern when he said, ‘There also is an issue, frankly, that's similar to the strategic nuclear issue which is: Do you ever want to do it? Do you want to legitimize that kind of weaponry?' The article insightfully concluded by saying, ‘Given the newness of the weapons, their potential power and the uncertainty about how they would work, the Pentagon's Joint Staff has issued classified “rules of engagement” that strictly require top-level approval for any cyber-attack'.\nThe DoD's then-classified Information Operations Roadmap, released in October of 2003, provided additional insights into the insider discussions regarding cyber authorities as well as military conceptions of cyber operations. The roadmap maintained five components for information operations but it replaced physical destruction with Computer Network Operations (CNO). It also included several recommendations devoted to CNA and Computer Network Defence (CND). One notable recommendation was that United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM, the parent command for cyber operations at the time) classify CNA capabilities into more refined categories that could allow for differentiated levels of authority to use them. The roadmap proposed three categories of weapons: those that could be allocated to a combatant commander, those pre-allocated to support aspects of specified operational or contingency plans, and those that were not assigned to combatant commanders and therefore required Secretary or Presidential approval. Not only was it remarkable as the first attempt to distinguish between levels of cyber weapons, rather than merely thinking of cyber as a single capability, but it also demonstrated that the authority to use cyber-attack techniques would still be restricted to very high-levels. It highlighted how, even with a more refined understanding of cyber weaponization, there was still a significant reticence to use them.\nThe advancement of cyber operations as a distinct military element itself accelerated in the years that followed. After the 2004 National Military Strategy declared cyberspace a warfighting domain for the first time, the\n#\nC. L. ROSS\nJCS released the first-ever military strategy for cyber operations in 2006. The then-classified National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations presented a far more nuanced and robust understanding of the domain than previous unclassified doctrine or policy statements. It provided an updated definition for cyberspace along with a list of domain characteristics and key features that drove the strategy's development. The only strategic end that has been declassified was the first one, which sought to deter adversaries 'from establishing or employing offensive capabilities against US interests in cyberspace'. It is unclear if 'establishing' referred to preventing the development of cyber capabilities. If so, it would have been a lofty goal to say the least, as the low barrier to entry made it virtually impossible to stop. However, it would have mirrored concepts of nuclear non-proliferation, which seek to prevent nations from even developing nuclear weapons in the first place due to their destructive power. In pursuing deterrence by imposing costs, denying benefits, and 'inducing adversary restraint based on demonstrated US capabilities', the strategy ultimately echoed elements within existing nuclear deterrence theory.\nAlthough defence and national security leadership matured their ideas and strategy concerning cyberspace in the early years of the Global War on Terror, it did not become a major personal focus for President George W. Bush until the end of his time in office. However, that changed with a meeting in April 2007. It appears that President Bush approved a covert action request within the first five minutes of what was supposed to be an hour-long meeting. Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), took advantage of the newly-available fifty-five minutes to talk to the president about McConnell's concerns for national cyber defence – a major topic of anxiety for him. McConnell would later talk about cyber threats, specifically an attack against the financial industry or critical infrastructure, as one of the primary threats that kept him up at night. His inclusion of cyber as a new weapon of mass destruction alongside nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the same interview clearly demonstrated how he thought about the threat from cyber operations. McConnell used the time with\n78Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Military Strategy of Cyberspace Operations, December 2006. This document is now partially declassified. https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/21419-document-23\n79Ibid., 13.\n80Ibid.\n81Details about the meeting's content come primarily from secondary sources. In Playing to the Edge, Hayden provided the only primary source material when he specifically credited DNI McConnell with selling Bush on the 'immediacy of the cyber threat and convinced him to launch the CNCI', 177. Kaplan's Dark Territory includes a more in-depth telling of events based on his interviews of unknown members, 174-178. Clarke's Cyber War provides fewer details than Kaplan but they largely agree with Kaplan's narrative, 114.\n82Mike McConnell, interview by Charlie Rose, The Charlie Rose Show, PBS, 8 January 2009. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Speeches%20and%20Interviews/20090108_interview.pdf\n83Ibid.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nthe President to highlight many of the previous decade's findings about America's vulnerability to cyber-attacks as well as its potential for strategic impact on national security. To punctuate his point to Bush, McConnell purportedly told the president that if Al Qaeda had been smarter, they would have launched a cyber-attack against a major bank in New York City and corrupted the files, which would have caused more economic damage than the attack on the Twin Towers.\nThe discussion apparently lit a fire under the president and he directed McConnell to quickly produce a solution. When McConnell later told the president that the plan would be expensive, Bush allegedly said that he was willing to spend as much as had been spent on the Manhattan Project to work towards solutions. The result was the then-classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative as outlined in NSPD-54 Cybersecurity Policy. The initiative sought to improve the defence of government systems as well as those critical to national security, national economic security, or public health and safety. While the funding details are not clear, it was reported to include tens of billions of dollars, which demonstrated the administration's level of concern over the issue. The initiative was rebranded by the incoming Obama administration but largely kept the same structure. The growing conceptions regarding both the threats and opportunities of cyber operations eventually led Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to approve the stand-up of a combatant command dedicated to the domain of cyberspace the following year.\n# Conclusion\nThe historical development of cyber within the United States leading up to the creation of USCYBERCOM demonstrates several recurring themes that shaped national and defence leaders' conceptions about cyber operations. The first theme is that cyber operations were birthed in strategic applications. They were first introduced to disrupt and defeat Soviet nuclear forces and their command and control. Those concepts were later applied against Iraqi leadership in Desert Storm with smashing success. The desire to replicate such a definitive victory in future conflicts spawned two subsequent decades\n84Kaplan, Dark Territory, 174.\n85Kaplan's Dark Territory records Bush saying he wanted a solution in thirty days, 175, while Clarke's Cyber War quoted him saying, 'I want a plan, soon, real soon', 114.\n86Kaplan, Dark Territory, 178.\n87National Security Presidential Directive, 54, Cybersecurity Policy, 8 January 2008, 4. https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-54.pdf.

Knopf 2014), 193-4.\nof evolving thought over how to quickly win wars by using information and computers to cripple adversary leadership and their strategic systems.\nThe second theme is that leaders increasingly feared the potential of a cyber attack against critical infrastructure. The growing interconnectivity of vital data, networks, and infrastructure meant that those elements were becoming progressively more vulnerable to cyber threats. The strategic nature of those targets meant that cyber operations could theoretically have strategic impacts on critical societal and warfighting functions, which dominated senior leaders' thinking about the threat. Early advocates regularly used the doomsday possibility of a ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage.\nThe final theme is that early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives concentrated on nuclear war and high-profile terrorism, and it became easily interwoven with both. Computers and the internet were exciting and novel technologies to the majority of Americans during the early days of cyber, including senior leaders, but few understood much about how either computers or the internet worked. However, they were regularly told that a teenager with a computer bought at RadioShack could now cause disruption on the scale of nuclear weapons. Additionally, most of the cyber-attacks they read about in the news came from mischievous individuals as bolts out of the blue. Cyber operations were thus easily linked in the minds of senior leaders to the leading security issues of the times -- nuclear weapons and high-profile terrorism.\nUntil further information is declassified regarding cyber operations that occurred during the time period, it will be impossible to fully assess how much the rhetoric matched reality. Still, the context within which strategic thought develops influences the direction that it will go. Although obvious when stated, it is a truism that strategists and leaders neglect at their own peril. The context surrounding the development of thought regarding cyberspace in America affected the frameworks, authorities, and operations that leaders applied to the domain, potentially to the benefit and detriment of national security. Fears of a cyber Pearl Harbor enabled advocates to garner attention and resources for cyber issues. However, the focus on catastrophic attacks led to an underappreciation of how a campaign of individually inconsequential events can shape geopolitical contexts towards favourable ends. Early intrusions by computer-savvy teenagers highlighted the insecure nature of networks and facilitated the initial development of cybersecurity. Yet they also created unrealistic expectations in leaders about how easy it would be for future cyber operators to create on-order effects against hard targets. Describing cyber-attacks as moving at the speed of light and capable of reaching anywhere\nin the networked world helped leaders to understand the potential of cyber operations. But it also downplayed the intense time and work required to locate a desired network, gain access, understand the environment, and then develop capabilities to achieve specific and predictable effects. The true impact or validity of these conceptions can only be fully determined once more information becomes available. However, they serve as a reminder to leaders about the need to continuously examine the assumptions and reasoning from which they are operating -- always seeking to validate or disprove them -- to ensure that their cognitive frameworks best reflect reality as it is.\n## Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank C.

Ross Schriever Space Scholars, Air Command and Staff College, Montgomery, AL, USA # ABSTRACT Futurist depictions of cyber-attacks in coming wars often portray them as bolts out of the blue that will cause immense damage to a nation's warfighting capacity and create chaos among its populace by crippling its essential services. However, those depictions are based more on prophecy than they are on historical realities. The historical development of conceptions about cyber operations explains how those themes came to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States. Rather than being self-evident, the themes are a result of the application of early cyber efforts to strategic operations, advocacy that focused on doomsday scenarios to draw attention to cybersecurity problems, and the ease with which cyber threats were tied to the primary strategic narratives of American national security during their development.\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 September 2022; Accepted 18 November 2023 KEYWORDS Cyber; Pearl Harbor; cybersecurity; information warfare; information operations; cyberspace; future war # Introduction In his 2011 book Cyber War, Richard Clarke, the former Special Advisor to the President for Cybersecurity, outlined a fictional depiction of a full-scale cyber war in America. His scenario began with the White House Situation Room receiving a message from the National Security Agency (NSA) about multiple malware targeting critical infrastructure before the desk officer subsequently becomes bombarded with messages about systems failing across the country. Department of Defense networks go offline, gas refineries explode in multiple major cities, chemical plants leak poisonous gas into the environment, aeroplanes collide in mid-air after air traffic control centres lose their air picture, and rail traffic ceased due to trains and subways derailing at key junction points.

Americans panic and looting ensues as a result of the breakdown of essential services in the days that follow, which completely overwhelms the police and emergency services. He concluded by saying that 'A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country'.\nWhile notable for the exceedingly grim nature of his prediction, it is largely consistent with the chorus of prognostications regarding the impact that cyber operations will play in the future. As Andy Greenberg at Wired puts it, 'The threat of cyberwar looms over the future: a new dimension of conflict capable of leapfrogging borders and teleporting the chaos of war to civilians thousands of miles beyond its front'. Fiction literature about the future of war is riddled with these themes. Ghost Fleet, a novel by political scientist and futurist P. W. Singer, details a Chinese surprise attack against the United States that largely succeeds due to crippling cyber-attacks against American weapon systems and infrastructure. Similarly, Admiral James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman's novel 2034 includes cyber-attacks that cause national power blackouts and government computer lockouts, while also disabling fighter aircraft and naval vessels across the globe. The themes are not unique to fictional stories though – indeed, the authors included those elements in the plotlines precisely because they capture the fears of policymakers in the real world. Testifying before Congress in 2011, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta talked about how the next Pearl Harbor-type attack likely could come from a cyber-attack. 'If you have a cyber-attack that brings down our power-grid system, brings down our financial system, brings down our government systems, you could paralyze this country... And I think that's a real potential'. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, echoed the sentiment and said that the threat from cyber operations 'is increasing in scope and scale, and its impact is difficult to overstate'.\nInterestingly, these images of cyber operations seem to be grounded in prophesy rather than historical realities. While cyber has become associated with the image of a catastrophic surprise attack, the history of cyber-attacks has been dominated by the less dramatic elements of espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Likewise, the strategic state conflicts that have included cyber elements did not include surprise cyber-attacks. Instead, they took place in larger geopolitical conflicts that offered ample warning time for 1Richard A. Clarke, Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It (New York, NY: Harper Collins 2010), 67.\n2Jason Ryan, 'CIA Director Leon Panetta Warns of Possible Cyber-Pearl Harbor', ABC News, 10 February 2011, https://abcnews.go.com/News/cia-director-leon-panetta-warns-cyber-pearl-harbor/story?id=12888905.\n3Ibid.\n# C. L. ROSS defenders. Moreover, the assumptions about the fragility of modern interconnected societies that underpin these themes have largely gone unquestioned despite the fact that similar assumptions about the effects of strategic bombing proved questionable in the Second World War. Strategic bombing failed to break German or Japanese will and economies proved far more resilient than air-power proponents believed, yet many readily assume that massive cyber-attacks today would succeed where millions of tons of high explosives could not. The question becomes, how have these themes come to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States?\nUnfortunately, little work has been done to understand the historical development of cyber thinking. In fact, literature on the history of cyber operations in general is rather sparse. Fred Kaplan's Dark Territory is perhaps the most well-known work, but as a journalist writing for a popular audience, it does not provide many details regarding its source material. The Atlantic Council's A Fierce Domain, edited by Jason Healey, is the best scholarly work. It provides a general background but its primary focus is several case studies documenting specific cyber events. USCYBERCOM's historian, Michael Warner, has also written a number of useful articles on the history of cyber operations. However, even fewer authors have explored the intellectual and cultural history of cyber thinking. Thomas Rid's Cyber War Will Not Take Place includes historical case studies and makes an argument that cyber operations should not be considered a form of warfare, but he does not fully trace how contemporaries considered them, how those conceptions changed over time, nor what factors influenced those changes. His Rise of the Machines provides a rich history of the ideas and field of cybernetics, which tangentially relates to cyber operations, but it does not examine the idea of cyber operations directly. Sarah White's recent doctoral thesis titled Subcultural Influences on Military Innovation: The Development of U.S. Military Cyber Doctrine comes closest to documenting the progression of thought, but it more specifically explores the influence of service culture and operational experience on military approaches to new technologies.\nYet understanding that historical development is vitally important. Charting the history of conceptions about cyber operations provides critical insights into how the current images of cyber rose to such prominence in the American psyche. The ideas were not self-evident but instead were formed and framed by several cultural, social, political, and military factors and events. Understanding the evolution of those conceptions is also no mere 4Jason Healey, 'A Brief History of US Cyber Conflict', in Jason Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain (Washington DC: Cyber Conflict Studies Association 2013), 17.\n5For a great historical study of the conceptual development of strategic bombing and the impact those conceptions had in the employment of bombers in World War II, see Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press 2004).\nintellectual exercise -- ideas influence action, policy, and strategy, and incorrect ideas can lead to disastrous results. Moreover, knowing the assumptions and reasoning that underpinned the early development of strategic thinking can facilitate more thoughtful policy and strategy in the future. Outlining the flow of ideas from previous generations enables leaders and policymakers to better assess their own assumptions and reasoning as they wrestle with current and future challenges.\nIn examining the historical development of American strategic thought regarding cyber operations, three major themes influenced how cyber was conceived leading up to the creation of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009. First, initial cyber capability development in the United States occurred in the context of strategic operations. The primary targets for initial cyber operations, the impact they sought to produce, and the problems they tried to solve all centred around nuclear operations or strategic leadership decision-making. Second, the increasing interconnectivity of critical data and infrastructure meant that cyber operations could theoretically have massive impacts on the economy and national security. Early advocates regularly focused on these doomsday possibilities in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage. Finally, early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives regarding nuclear war and high-profile terrorism. The potential impact and low barrier of entry of cyber operations made it easy for senior leaders to associate cyber with those strategic narratives. These three threads emerge as the most formative themes in the development of conceptions about cyber, and they led senior leaders to view cyber capabilities as strategic weapons capable of impacts on par with weapons of mass destruction.\n## A note on definitions Providing clear and unified definitions for cyber and cyberspace is a recurring struggle and theme of the history of military cyber efforts. Definitions for terms like cyberspace, cyber operations, information warfare, command and control warfare, and others have evolved throughout time. As such, it is difficult to use terms consistently throughout the article, particularly because there was significant overlap between the various terms and they were used almost synonymously during certain periods of time. However, the intent is to understand how cyberspace and cyber operations came to be understood as they are today.\nSince 2008, joint doctrine has defined cyberspace as ‘A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, # C. L. ROSS telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'.6 Thus, cyber operations are plainly defined as 'The employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace'.7 While individuals, organizations, and military services have emphasized particular aspects in their use of the term cyber (for example the networks, the information, the electromagnetic spectrum, etc.), I intend the terms 'cyber' and 'cyber operations' to synonymously capture the imprecise ideas that American national security professionals commonly mean when they discuss the terms today, which broadly centre around concepts of computer hacking. Essentially, they refer to operations that disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, along with operations taken to prevent others from doing the same. When military members talk of using 'cyber' to disrupt an integrated air defence system, suggest that the next war will begin with 'cyber', or talk of a 'cyber' officer, they are typically referring to cyber as a distinct military capability that includes using a computer system to achieve some effect on another computer system or its information, while also trying to prevent the same from occurring on one's own systems. It is in that sense that I use the terms cyber and cyber operations.\n# Cyber precursors Disrupting an adversary's communications, information warfare, and using the electromagnetic spectrum to achieve objectives are not new phenomena. However, the march towards the modern version of conflict within cyberspace began because of two trends in the latter half of the $21^{\\text{st}}$ century. First, the exponential growth of electrical computing technology and its proliferation within the security apparatus increasingly presented the possibility of exploitation by adversaries. Second, the movement towards storing and transporting wealth and secrets in digital data, along with the growth of strategic systems reliant on computers and networking, produced growing motivation for adversaries to take advantage of those possibilities. Together, these trends gradually produced and elevated cyber-related issues as concerns for national security.\nAlmost from the very beginning of the digital revolution, analysts identified inherent security issues with the explosion of digital technology in the United States Air Force, Air Force Doctrine Publications 3-12 - Cyberspace Operations (Washington DC 2023), 6, https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/AFDP_3-12/3-12-AFDP-CYBERSPACE-OPS.pdf.\n\nDepartment of Defense, United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms (Washington DC: Department of Defense 2019), 233.\n8Michael Warner, 'A Brief History of Cyber Conflict', in Schneider et al. (ed.), Ten Years In (Newport RI: Naval War College 2020), 15.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # military. Thomas Rona, a Boeing advisor to the Secretary of Defense's Office of Net Assessment, wrote a paper in 1976 titled 'Weapon Systems and Information War' that wrestled with the challenges introduced by the information age. He noted that the growing complexity of weapon systems meant that they were increasingly dependent upon external information sources for successful engagements, whether it be intelligence, targeting information, or command and control orders.[9] That dependency created the possibility that weapon systems could be defeated through information denial. Of course, these changes produced both opportunities and vulnerabilities – information warfare could cut both ways. The United States needed to consider how to attack an adversary's information flow as well as how it would protect its own.[10] While his report focused on information warfare predominantly as a means to defeat weapon systems, Rona recognized that there were broader implications and opportunities for strategic warfare.[11] While Rona looked at information warfare broadly applied to weapons, others focused more specifically on the threat to command and control. As computers became more integrated with the control and employment of force, military members increasingly regarded them as critical assets that required defending as well as potential targets that could be exploited. A 1976 Defense Science Board study on conventional force counters to a Warsaw Pact attack highlighted how disruption of Soviet troop control systems could serve as a critical counterbalance to their numerical superiority.[12] As American awareness subsequently grew regarding Soviet reliance on a tightly controlled and automated system for directing their forces, the military increasingly viewed attacks on the Soviet command and control structure as vital force multipliers. Consequently, the Department of Defense (DoD) began developing a set of doctrinal ideas eventually known as command-and-control warfare (C2W) in 1979 in an effort to negate the numerical advantage of Soviet forces. C2W concepts became highly intertwined with those of information warfare over the next two decades, and both served as the cocoon within which military conceptions of cyber operations initially developed.\nThe increasing digitization also produced greater overlap with signals intelligence techniques. While traditional communications collection relied on intercepting analog signals transmitted on telephone lines or broadcast over the air, digital signals required more robust processing to break out the data and information. The National Security Agency (NSA) and signals It's Col Evan H. Parrott, 'C3CM: Theory, Application, and Process', Research Report, February (Maxwell Air Force Base: Air War College 1983), 14.\nintelligence organizations in the military were on the front lines of this new frontier since they led the effort to discover and collect adversary command and control information. Thus, they were also optimally positioned to be able to manipulate that information or the systems they resided within.\nAs signals intelligence produced greater access into Soviet systems, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought to operationalize them in 1982 through a little-known organization called the Joint Special Studies Group. According to Bruce Berkowitz, the purpose of JSSG was to ‘determine whether vulnerabilities identified from critical node analysis, such as message intercepts, jamming, and signals injection into adversary networks, could be turned into a military or intelligence capability'. The goal was to find ways to affect their automated command and control network or to sow doubts about the integrity of the information in the minds of Soviet leaders. By 1984 though, policymakers, including President Ronald Reagan, began to get concerned about the ability to control the effects of information warfare techniques, especially since they were directed toward strategic Soviet systems and could create considerable problems if they went awry. In the end, while the JSSG was able to model Soviet nuclear communication networks, they never discovered a silver bullet to guarantee disruption of communications, and the program was shut down in 1989 with the end of the Cold War. However, their concepts served as major forerunners to Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA).\nJust as the Joint Chiefs were standing up the JSSG, elements within pop culture began to use hacking-related themes that impacted national security in surprising ways. The 1983 film WarGames starring Matthew Broderick initiated several governmental actions regarding computer security and created enduring conceptions of the cyber threat. The movie details a teenage hacker who almost starts a global nuclear war when he accidentally hacks into a supercomputer at NORAD. In June of 1983, Reagan watched the film while on retreat at Camp David and he proceeded to discuss the plot with members of Congress as well as his national security staff. According to journalist Fred Kaplan, Reagan's inquiries into whether the film's plot could play out in real life led him to discover that the threat of computer intrusion was even worse than he imagined. The subsequent string of events ultimately led to the confidential National Security Decision Directive 145 (NSDD- THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # 145), titled National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security. It served as the first time that presidential policy addressed what would later become aspects of cyber operations and it originated over concerns about cyber actions leading to nuclear conflict.\nThe President was not the only one concerned about the feasibility of the plot – American media organizations anxiously questioned governmental officials about it following the release of the film. The three major television networks ran a flurry of reports about computer and networking technology using WarGames as a framework for understanding their inherent dangers. Also, much of the reporting discussed it in the context of nuclear war.[20] A four-minute clip from the movie was shown at the opening of congressional hearings on computer security and representatives referenced the film throughout the hearings to help members conceptualize the threat.[21] Ultimately, those hearings led to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984.[22] Not only did the film enable both Presidential and Congressional action, but the movie also popularized the impression that hacking was the realm of anti-establishment teenagers and a potential weapon for global destruction.[23] Those conceptions provided a powerful framing effect for subsequent cyber events.\n# The Morris worm and Desert Storm Only a couple of years later, a real-world event both resonated with and evolved those conceptions. In November 1988, Robert T. Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell graduate student, released a worm onto the NSFNet, a precursor to the internet, from a remotely-accessed computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[24] The worm did not cause any damage to systems or data but within a manner of hours it had infected up to $10\\%$ of the network.[25] Its replication and spread clogged the processing power of computers to the point of crashing many of the systems.

L. ROSS convey the impact that the Morris worm had on the psyche of both the computer community and the nation writ large. While many researchers understood that networks and computers were vulnerable, the speed with which the virus spread across such extensive networks gave them a queasy feeling that they had experienced a close call.[26] A few simple alterations would have enabled the worm to destroy massive amounts of data or compromise large portions of sensitive research and defence information.[27] The ease and rapidity of its spread led pundits and officials to begin to ask about the vulnerability of other computer networks that business and infrastructure increasingly depended on. If a single individual could achieve such widespread effects, what could an individual do if they targeted systems associated with national security?\nUnsurprisingly, the event helped reinforce the early image of the malicious individual as the primary threat in cyberspace. While numerous news articles noted that the worm served as a giant wake-up call, the threat was commonly framed as one from hackers and terrorists as opposed to nation states or militaries.[28] That image was fortified by Dutch teenagers hacking into 34 American military installation networks between 1990–91, and young British hackers accessing networks at the Air Force's Rome Labs before routing through to a South Korean nuclear institute in 1994.[29] Policymakers increasingly worried about the impact well-resourced and determined individuals could have if teenagers were able to access such a wide swath of computers. Computer security expert Winn Schwartau did little to abate those fears when he testified in congress in 1991 that governmental and commercial systems were essentially defenceless and an 'electronic Pearl Harbor' was waiting to happen.[30] As early as the late 1980s, conceptions about cyber threats as primarily coming from malignant individuals and capable of devastating impact were already front and centre in the national dialogue about cyber.\nJust as Morris was going to trial, President George H. W. Bush ordered the bombardment of Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In a manner of weeks, the United States defeated a battle-hardened 26Peter J.

The coalition paralyzed Iraq's command and control infrastructure in the first hours of the attack, leaving Hussein and senior leaders blind, deaf, dumb, and deceived. The Iraqi disorder was juxtaposed against the highly networked and synchronized United States military. Many American defence experts concluded that the resulting information differential proved critical to the subsequent speed and ease with which America and its allies routed Iraqi forces. As a result, the victory shoved thinking about information warfare into overdrive among the defence community. As military thinkers sought to understand the roots of the success in order to replicate it in the future, many concluded that information warfare was the secret weapon for quick and decisive victories going forward.\nThe DoD quickly directed the services to organize and train for information warfare in then-classified DoD Directive 3600.1 (DODD TS-3600.1), titled Information Warfare and released in December 1992. It served as the first indication that elements of modern-day cyber were entering the official policy of the military. The Department formally defined information warfare as the competition of opposing information systems to include the exploitation, corruption, or destruction of an adversary's information systems through such means as signals intelligence and command and control countermeasures while protecting the integrity of one's own information systems from such attacks. The objective of information warfare is to attain a significant enough information advantage to enable the force overall to predominate and to do so quickly.[33] The directive essentially tied together many of the related concepts the military had been experimenting with in the previous two decades. It combined the signals-intelligence-enabled precursors to cyber operations, which the military created to counter Soviet nuclear command and control, with the broader C2W ideas developed prior to and then used in Desert Storm. And it was all with the intent of replicating the speed and success of the Gulf War in future conflicts. While the directive served as the introduction of information warfare into defence policy, it was only the beginning, as the post-war period spawned a flurry of ideas and thinking about information warfare from which cyber would later emerge.\n\n# C. L. ROSS The sense of change and evolution presented by the digital revolution and Desert Storm was only magnified by the unexpected end of the Cold War. The pacing threat for the previous four decades suddenly disappeared and America found itself the lone superpower on the world stage.[34] The vacuum created by the dissolution of the USSR was quickly filled by a focus on high-profile terrorism. As the Soviet empire collapsed, the threat of Soviet nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue nations became a palpable fear for national leadership. The rise of high-profile terrorism as the most pressing security issue of the new century had a direct effect on the development of strategic thinking about cyberspace for the next two decades.\n# Terrorism and cyber Pearl Harbors President William Clinton's administration became the first to systematically deal with the issue of terrorism as it faced several terrorist attacks in the first years of his presidency.[35] However, it was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that proved most impactful on the president and for cyber operations. The bombing moved him personally, and it led him to wonder about the threat terrorists could pose to more strategic or symbolic locations throughout the country.[36] Through a number of subsequent events, he eventually appointed a Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (later known as the Marsh Commission after its lead, John Marsh) to investigate the vulnerability of important facilities to terrorist attacks.\nThe release of the commission's final report in October of 1997 surprised many by focusing primarily on cyber threats as opposed to traditional physical attacks. The commission noted that all critical infrastructure was dependent on unsecure information technology.[37] While the commission did not find evidence of impending cyber-attacks, it did discover widespread capabilities to exploit infrastructure vulnerabilities. Further, because the commission was created primarily to consider terrorist threats, it largely described the threat from cyber as coming from terrorists and criminals vice nation-state actors.[38] The report never explicitly compared cyber to nuclear weapons but, as with much of the contemporaneous literature, cyber threats were mentioned in the same context as terrorists using weapons of mass destruction.\n34George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 (Oxford UK: Oxford University Press 2011), 920.\n35Ibid., 936.\n36Clarke, Cyber War, 106.\n37Critical infrastructure examined in the report included transportation, oil and gas, water, emergency services, government services, banking and finance, electrical power, and telecommunications. See Robert T. Marsh, 'Critical Foundations: Protecting America's Infrastructures', The Report of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 13 October (Washington DC: 1997), 3-4.\n38Ibid., i.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # While the possibility of chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists adds a new and frightening dimension to physical attacks, such weapons are difficult to acquire. In contrast... a personal computer and a telephone connection to an Internet Service Provider anywhere in the world are enough to cause harm'.39 In reality, the cyber threat from terrorists would largely prove non-existent over the next twenty-five years.40 However, the report's focus on the devastation that a cyber-attack could cause to highly-vulnerable critical infrastructure, and its concentration on terrorists as the primary threat actors, further solidified conceptions of cyber-attacks as catastrophic surprise attacks that were launched by malignant individuals.\nThe urgent tone of the report was underscored by several prominent events that occurred within a couple of years of its release. In June 1997, the JCS launched a no-notice exercise known as ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 97 to test the cyber defences of DoD networks and critical infrastructure. The exercise was the brainchild of NSA Director Lt Gen Kenneth Minihan, who was frustrated at how little the DoD accounted for the threats or opportunities cyber presented in his previous years leading Air Force cyber operations.[41] Thirty-five NSA red-team hackers split into two teams—one in the United States and one on a ship in the Pacific. Armed with no inside information, and using only store-bought computers and hacking tools downloaded from the internet, they proceeded to run rampant through networks leaving marker files to prove where they had been.[42] According to Kaplan's interviews, the portion of the exercise devoted to national infrastructure attacks was a tabletop exercise without real-world intrusions. However, the attackers were actually allowed to penetrate defence networks for the other portion. In doing so, they were able to access the National Military Command Center, send false emails, reformat hard drives, alter communications, shut down phone lines, and sow doubt into command and control – much of what C2W and information warfare had envisioned throughout the preceding decade.[43] John Campbell, the Major General in charge of information operations on the Joint Staff, put it bluntly when he said, ‘... frankly it scared the hell out of a lot of folks because the implications of what this team had been able to do were pretty far-reaching’.[44] DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that it had ‘succeeded beyond its planner’s wildest dreams in elevating the awareness of threats to our computer systems’.[45] It shocked DoD Deputy 39Ibid., x.\n40While terrorists have relied heavily on the internet for recruiting, communications, and fundraising, there have been no major cyber-attacks or intrusions from terrorists; see Healey, Fierce Domain, 64.\n41Kaplan, Dark Territory, 64.\n42Healey, Fierce Domain, 42.\n43Kaplan, Dark Territory, 69-70.\n44John Campbell, 'Lessons from Our Cyber Past, The First Military Cyber Units', in Healey (ed.), Fierce Domain, 56.\n45Warner, 'Cybersecurity', 797.\n# C. L. ROSS Secretary and previous sceptic John Hamre, who later said that it showed 'This country is wide open to attack electronically... We didn't really let them take down the power system in the country, but we made them prove they knew how to do it'.46 ELIGIBLE RECEIVER provided a vivid example to policymakers of what the Marsh Commission had discussed only in hypotheticals, and it magnified the threat of information warfare to senior leaders on the Joint Staff.\nWhile the DoD was still processing the lessons learned from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, the Department experienced a series of intrusions in February 1998 dubbed SOLAR SUNRISE that sparked fears of the beginning of a real-world cyber war. Hamre, with the previous exercise fresh on his mind, notified the President early in the intrusions and said that the incident 'might be the first shots of a genuine cyber war, perhaps by Iraq'.[47] At the time, tensions were particularly high over Iraq's lack of cooperation with United Nations inspectors regarding its weapons of mass destruction program. Several intrusions were traced to the Middle East, leading many to believe Iraqi involvement. It proved to be an embarrassing example of the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace, as it turned out to be the work of California teenagers aided by an Israeli mentor.[48] Hamre later called it 'the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date', and it emotionally underlined leaders' previous fears from ELIGIBLE RECEIVER and the Marsh Commission, even though it ultimately had little impact.[49] It was in the environment of these prominent events that the Pearl Harbor analogy gained significant steam as officials tried to grow awareness of cyber threats. In the events that led to the Marsh Commission, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified to Congress, 'There is a present threat... We have not yet had a terrorist cyber-attack on the infrastructure. But I think that that is just a matter of time. We do not need to wait for the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor before we wake up to the threat and take steps to confront it'.[50] Senator Sam Nunn, who led the Congressional hearings, later said that the two most significant dangers America faced were terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons and a cyber Pearl Harbor.[51] In other hearings, 46John J. Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense, speech to the Fortune 500 CIO Forum, Aspen, Colorado, 21 July 1998 https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell//library/news/1998/07/t08121998_t072198.\n47Healey, Fierce Domain, 43.\n\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nDespite the chorus of predictions about cyber doomsday, some cautioned against the comparison. They noted that an attacker would need significant knowledge of the operating systems, hardware, and networks, as well as the interaction between all of those components, to create the systemic effects that experts warned about. The primary threat for that level of attack would more likely arise from a dedicated team of professionals employed by a nation-state. Thus, an attack would likely take place in a specific geopolitical context rather than being a bolt out of the blue.54 Nevertheless, the analogy became very popular and continued to gain steam over the next twenty years in sounding the alarm over cyber threats.\n## Increasing cyber awareness The inclusion of cyber threats in the National Security Strategies (NSS) during this period further reflected the government’s growing acceptance of the role of cyber in security issues. The 1997 NSS was the first to allude to cyber when it commented on technology making transnational threats more potent than before.55 It also included the first NSS comment – albeit a minor one – on the need to protect critical infrastructure from intrusion.56 The next NSS in 1999 indicated how much cyber thought advanced from the events of the intervening years. Defending critical infrastructure from paralyzing attacks was added to the list of vital national interests, alongside protecting the nation’s territory, citizens, allies, and economic well-being.57 In the large portions devoted to infrastructure, it focused heavily on the threats from cyberspace. As with other documents of the era, cyber-attacks were included in the list of technology advancements, along with weapons of mass destruction, that enabled terrorists or rogue nations to pose a greater risk than before. However, the awareness of cyber threats did not solely apply to\n\n# C. L. ROSS infrastructure. The 1999 NSS was also the first to discuss the importance of information superiority to military readiness and command and control.[58] The inclusion of information superiority in the NSS was a manifestation of the DoD's growing concern about information warfare throughout the period. The ongoing defence dialogue on information warfare adapted to and folded in many of the same insights and ideas that the Marsh Commission, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, and the SOLAR SUNRISE intrusions identified. Other internal studies and exercises only added to the concerns. Recognizing that the growth of cyberspace would profoundly impact national security, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a series of exercises on information warfare in 1996 to help develop a national information warfare strategy.[59] Their report identified that much of national infrastructure (what the Marsh Commission would later include in critical infrastructure) was connected to the internet and attacks on such would take on a strategic aspect. Thus, they framed the challenge as 'strategic information warfare'.[60] The more their participants became aware of information warfare's possibilities in the exercises, the more fearful they became of the impacts it could have. Only a couple of months later, the General Accounting Office warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the problems plaguing the civilian internet were increasingly threatening DoD information systems. They reported that 'The potential for catastrophic damage is great. Organized foreign nationals or terrorists could use\"information warfare\"techniques to disrupt military operations by harming command and control systems, the public switch network, and other systems or networks Defense relies on'.[61] Further, a report from the Defense Science Board Task Force on Information Warfare Defense in November of 1996 stated that cyberspace threats to infrastructure created 'a tunnel of vulnerability previously unrealized in the history of conflict'.[62] The possibilities of information warfare became increasingly dire the more military leaders considered it.\nThe arrival of the new century brought more high-profile cyber issues and they too were accompanied by a continual chorus of fears about cyber destruction. The year 2000 itself created significant concern in the computer community over the potential impacts it would have on how computers 58Ibid., 12.\n59Roger C. Molander, Andrew S. Riddle and Peter A.

There was widespread concern at the time that power, transportation, banking, and other critical systems would fail at midnight and cause the extensive panic envisioned in the cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios. Several internet worms also garnered significant attention around the same time. ILOVEYOU, Melissa, Code Red, NIMDA, SQL Slammer, and others captured headlines and the awareness of Americans. In February of 2000, a 16-year-old Canadian used a program downloaded off the internet to conduct a distributed-denial-of-service attack against Amazon, CNN, eBay, Yahoo, and others. Not only did it make headlines for simultaneously hitting several big companies, but it led President Clinton to organize the first White House roundtable on cybersecurity. While these public hacks drew a lot of press, none of them was deeply impactful, nor did they directly influence national security issues outside of elevating the prominence of cyber within the national conscious writ large. The most concerning thing about them was the constant drumbeat of articles warning that more dangerous attacks were imminent and that it was only a matter of time before cyber-terrorists brought the nation to its knees.\nA major cyber-espionage case in early 2001 actually did have a significant impact on the DoD, though its effects came in the form of information compromise. A series of intrusions dubbed MOONLIGHT MAZE launched a high-profile, multi-year investigation and provided the first indication of a changing threat environment. The details are still classified but the incursions appeared to have begun in March 1998 and affected hundreds of computers at NASA, the Pentagon, other governmental agencies, private universities, and research labs. SOLAR SUNRISE was a scare, but this event became truly worrying for policymakers. They appeared to be the first major intrusions conducted by a nation-state, they lasted for several years with disturbingly few clues about who was behind them or what they were taking, and the government could not seem to stop them. Evidence suggested Russian actors targeting unclassified sensitive technical research matters, but the sparse details caused discomfort. Two years after the discovery, James Adams, a member of NSA's advisory board, characterized the attack to the Washington Post as ‘the most persistent and serious computer attack against # C. L. ROSS the United States to date'. He also stated that attacks continued unabated and had triggered the 'largest cyber-intelligence investigation ever'. Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre, ever on the lookout for a cyber conflict, allegedly told congressional colleagues, 'We're in the middle of a cyberwar'.\nUnfortunately, everything in the national security apparatus turned upside down when the fears about a massive terrorist attack against critical American facilities became reality on 11 September of that year. While it neither came via cyber means nor did it cripple America, it did drastically revector the nation's defence as it absorbed the shock of the attacks and gradually funnelled its response into the Global War on Terror. In a continuation of the trends of the previous half-decade, news articles in the weeks following the attacks continued to warn that cyberspace would likely provide the vector for the next big strike. The shock of September $11^{\\text{th}}$ further cemented a fear of massive surprise attacks from unknown dark forces in the American psyche.\n# Cyber authorities and the first cyber strategies As the United States began both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the concepts for cyber operations as a distinct military capability began to solidify and mature, enabling further development of authorities and strategies for operating in cyberspace. While cyber was increasingly talked about as something distinct from information warfare, the two were still deeply intertwined and often used interchangeably into the 2000s. That began to change in official policy in late 1996 but it took several years for the distinction to fully materialize. In then-classified DoD Directive S-3600.1, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White rechristened information warfare to information operations and, for the first time in official documents, defined computer network attack. However, as cyber gradually emerged from information warfare as a distinct capability, its development and maturation were directly influenced by the conceptions formed over the previous two decades.\nThe Bush Administration's attempts to provide increased clarity on authorities for cyber operations in the run-up to the war shed light on American leadership's conceptions of cyber at that point in time. The Washington Post reported that Bush signed the classified National Security Presidential Directive 16 (NSPD-16) in July of 2002 to provide the first national-level guidance on when and how the United States would launch cyber-attacks against an adversary.[73] Predictably, the article likened the development to 71Vernon Loeb, 'NSA Adviser Says Cyber-Assaults On Pentagon Persist With Few Clues', The Washington Post, 7 May 2001, https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nsa-adviser-says-cyber-assaults-on-pentagon/docview/409117447/se-2?accountid=4332.\n72We're in the Middle of a Cyberwar', Newsweek, 19 September 1999.\n73Bradley Graham, 'Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare', The Washington Post, 7 February 2003, https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-pr04/readings/week5/bush_guidelines..\nthe formulation of guidelines in the early days of nuclear weapons. However, the article also discussed how the administration and the DoD were still wrestling with some of the aspects of cyber conflict and whether it should be unleashed. According to the article, part of the hesitation to launch attacks stemmed from America's vulnerability to cyber and concerns about establishing a norm that could be used against the United States. Richard Clarke, who had recently resigned from his post as Special Advisor to the President on Cybersecurity, highlighted another concern when he said, ‘There also is an issue, frankly, that's similar to the strategic nuclear issue which is: Do you ever want to do it? Do you want to legitimize that kind of weaponry?' The article insightfully concluded by saying, ‘Given the newness of the weapons, their potential power and the uncertainty about how they would work, the Pentagon's Joint Staff has issued classified “rules of engagement” that strictly require top-level approval for any cyber-attack'.\nThe DoD's then-classified Information Operations Roadmap, released in October of 2003, provided additional insights into the insider discussions regarding cyber authorities as well as military conceptions of cyber operations. The roadmap maintained five components for information operations but it replaced physical destruction with Computer Network Operations (CNO). It also included several recommendations devoted to CNA and Computer Network Defence (CND). One notable recommendation was that United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM, the parent command for cyber operations at the time) classify CNA capabilities into more refined categories that could allow for differentiated levels of authority to use them. The roadmap proposed three categories of weapons: those that could be allocated to a combatant commander, those pre-allocated to support aspects of specified operational or contingency plans, and those that were not assigned to combatant commanders and therefore required Secretary or Presidential approval. Not only was it remarkable as the first attempt to distinguish between levels of cyber weapons, rather than merely thinking of cyber as a single capability, but it also demonstrated that the authority to use cyber-attack techniques would still be restricted to very high-levels. It highlighted how, even with a more refined understanding of cyber weaponization, there was still a significant reticence to use them.\nThe advancement of cyber operations as a distinct military element itself accelerated in the years that followed. After the 2004 National Military Strategy declared cyberspace a warfighting domain for the first time, the # C. L. ROSS JCS released the first-ever military strategy for cyber operations in 2006. The then-classified National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations presented a far more nuanced and robust understanding of the domain than previous unclassified doctrine or policy statements. It provided an updated definition for cyberspace along with a list of domain characteristics and key features that drove the strategy's development.[78] The only strategic end that has been declassified was the first one, which sought to deter adversaries 'from establishing or employing offensive capabilities against US interests in cyberspace'.[79] It is unclear if 'establishing' referred to preventing the development of cyber capabilities. If so, it would have been a lofty goal to say the least, as the low barrier to entry made it virtually impossible to stop. However, it would have mirrored concepts of nuclear non-proliferation, which seek to prevent nations from even developing nuclear weapons in the first place due to their destructive power. In pursuing deterrence by imposing costs, denying benefits, and 'inducing adversary restraint based on demonstrated US capabilities', the strategy ultimately echoed elements within existing nuclear deterrence theory.[80] Although defence and national security leadership matured their ideas and strategy concerning cyberspace in the early years of the Global War on Terror, it did not become a major personal focus for President George W. Bush until the end of his time in office. However, that changed with a meeting in April 2007. It appears that President Bush approved a covert action request within the first five minutes of what was supposed to be an hour-long meeting.[81] Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), took advantage of the newly-available fifty-five minutes to talk to the president about McConnell's concerns for national cyber defence – a major topic of anxiety for him. McConnell would later talk about cyber threats, specifically an attack against the financial industry or critical infrastructure, as one of the primary threats that kept him up at night.[82] His inclusion of cyber as a new weapon of mass destruction alongside nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the same interview clearly demonstrated how he thought about the threat from cyber operations.[83] McConnell used the time with 78Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Military Strategy of Cyberspace Operations, December 2006. This document is now partially declassified. https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/21419-document-23 79Ibid., 13.\n80Ibid.\n81Details about the meeting's content come primarily from secondary sources. In Playing to the Edge, Hayden provided the only primary source material when he specifically credited DNI McConnell with selling Bush on the 'immediacy of the cyber threat and convinced him to launch the CNCI', 177. Kaplan's Dark Territory includes a more in-depth telling of events based on his interviews of unknown members, 174-178. Clarke's Cyber War provides fewer details than Kaplan but they largely agree with Kaplan's narrative, 114.\n82Mike McConnell, interview by Charlie Rose, The Charlie Rose Show, PBS, 8 January 2009. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Speeches%20and%20Interviews/20090108_interview.pdf 83Ibid.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # the President to highlight many of the previous decade's findings about America's vulnerability to cyber-attacks as well as its potential for strategic impact on national security. To punctuate his point to Bush, McConnell purportedly told the president that if Al Qaeda had been smarter, they would have launched a cyber-attack against a major bank in New York City and corrupted the files, which would have caused more economic damage than the attack on the Twin Towers.[84] The discussion apparently lit a fire under the president and he directed McConnell to quickly produce a solution.[85] When McConnell later told the president that the plan would be expensive, Bush allegedly said that he was willing to spend as much as had been spent on the Manhattan Project to work towards solutions.[86] The result was the then-classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative as outlined in NSPD-54 Cybersecurity Policy. The initiative sought to improve the defence of government systems as well as those critical to national security, national economic security, or public health and safety.[87] While the funding details are not clear, it was reported to include tens of billions of dollars, which demonstrated the administration's level of concern over the issue.[88] The initiative was rebranded by the incoming Obama administration but largely kept the same structure. The growing conceptions regarding both the threats and opportunities of cyber operations eventually led Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to approve the stand-up of a combatant command dedicated to the domain of cyberspace the following year.[89] # Conclusion The historical development of cyber within the United States leading up to the creation of USCYBERCOM demonstrates several recurring themes that shaped national and defence leaders' conceptions about cyber operations. The first theme is that cyber operations were birthed in strategic applications. They were first introduced to disrupt and defeat Soviet nuclear forces and their command and control. Those concepts were later applied against Iraqi leadership in Desert Storm with smashing success. The desire to replicate such a definitive victory in future conflicts spawned two subsequent decades 84Kaplan, Dark Territory, 174.\n85Kaplan's Dark Territory records Bush saying he wanted a solution in thirty days, 175, while Clarke's Cyber War quoted him saying, 'I want a plan, soon, real soon', 114.\n86Kaplan, Dark Territory, 178.\n87National Security Presidential Directive, 54, Cybersecurity Policy, 8 January 2008, 4. https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-54.pdf. This document is now partially declassified.\n88Kaplan's Dark Territory reported the administration requested $18B over five years, 178. Clarke's Cyber War pegged the number at $50B over five years. Others reported $3.6B alone allocated to it in 2011, see Eric Chabrow, 'CNCI Budget Request Set at $3.6 Billion', GovInfoSecurity, 2 February 2010, https://www.govinfosecurity.com/cnci-budget-request-set-at-36-billion-a-2151.\n89Robert Gates, Duty (New York City NY: Alfred A. Knopf 2014), 193-4.\nof evolving thought over how to quickly win wars by using information and computers to cripple adversary leadership and their strategic systems.\nThe second theme is that leaders increasingly feared the potential of a cyber attack against critical infrastructure. The growing interconnectivity of vital data, networks, and infrastructure meant that those elements were becoming progressively more vulnerable to cyber threats. The strategic nature of those targets meant that cyber operations could theoretically have strategic impacts on critical societal and warfighting functions, which dominated senior leaders' thinking about the threat. Early advocates regularly used the doomsday possibility of a ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' in an attempt to awaken others to the threat posed by cyber, which created an enduring image of cyber operations as surprise attacks that result in catastrophic damage.\nThe final theme is that early cyber thought developed within broader security narratives concentrated on nuclear war and high-profile terrorism, and it became easily interwoven with both. Computers and the internet were exciting and novel technologies to the majority of Americans during the early days of cyber, including senior leaders, but few understood much about how either computers or the internet worked. However, they were regularly told that a teenager with a computer bought at RadioShack could now cause disruption on the scale of nuclear weapons. Additionally, most of the cyber-attacks they read about in the news came from mischievous individuals as bolts out of the blue. Cyber operations were thus easily linked in the minds of senior leaders to the leading security issues of the times -- nuclear weapons and high-profile terrorism.\nUntil further information is declassified regarding cyber operations that occurred during the time period, it will be impossible to fully assess how much the rhetoric matched reality. Still, the context within which strategic thought develops influences the direction that it will go. Although obvious when stated, it is a truism that strategists and leaders neglect at their own peril. The context surrounding the development of thought regarding cyberspace in America affected the frameworks, authorities, and operations that leaders applied to the domain, potentially to the benefit and detriment of national security. Fears of a cyber Pearl Harbor enabled advocates to garner attention and resources for cyber issues. However, the focus on catastrophic attacks led to an underappreciation of how a campaign of individually inconsequential events can shape geopolitical contexts towards favourable ends. Early intrusions by computer-savvy teenagers highlighted the insecure nature of networks and facilitated the initial development of cybersecurity. Yet they also created unrealistic expectations in leaders about how easy it would be for future cyber operators to create on-order effects against hard targets. Describing cyber-attacks as moving at the speed of light and capable of reaching anywhere in the networked world helped leaders to understand the potential of cyber operations. But it also downplayed the intense time and work required to locate a desired network, gain access, understand the environment, and then develop capabilities to achieve specific and predictable effects. The true impact or validity of these conceptions can only be fully determined once more information becomes available. However, they serve as a reminder to leaders about the need to continuously examine the assumptions and reasoning from which they are operating -- always seeking to validate or disprove them -- to ensure that their cognitive frameworks best reflect reality as it is.\n## Acknowledgments The author would like to thank C.

    "abstract": "Futurist depictions of cyber-attacks in coming wars often portray them as bolts out of the blue that will cause immense damage to a nation's warfighting capacity and create chaos among its populace by crippling its essential services. However, those depictions are based more on prophecy than they are on historical realities. The historical development of conceptions about cyber operations explains how those themes came to dominate national security discussions about cyber in the United States. Rather than being self-evident, the themes are a result of the application of early cyber efforts to strategic operations, advocacy that focused on doomsday scenarios to draw attention to cybersecurity problems, and the ease with which cyber threats were tied to the primary strategic narratives of American national security during their development.
