Helpful in understanding such attribution practice are three commonly recognized dimensions, respectively, from technical, political, and legal perspectives. Compared to confidentially processed attribution, to publicly blame a state should be better substantiated. But as legal deficiencies in the current body of international law, apart from also some technical obstacles, cannot live up to the political desire of the accuser to make public attribution, the ill-substantiation problem becomes prominent. Debates over the \"control test\" and misuse of due diligence principle in cyber scenarios extend the responsibility scope of the territorial state. Lack of essential evidentiary requirements cripples the predictability and falsifiability for bringing up accusation. Inculpability for erroneous attribution invites the accusing state's recklessness. In light of these legal deficiencies, an international norm on responsible state behavior for public attribution could be a promising way forward.\n\nKeywords Ill-Substantiated public attribution  $\\cdot$  Due diligence  $\\cdot$  Evidentiary requirements  $\\cdot$  Erroneous attribution  $\\cdot$  Responsible state behavior\n\nThis chapter is a fully revised and expanded article developed with permission from the author's earlier contribution to a research report on Managing U.S.-China Tensions Over Public Cyber Attribution, published by Carnegie Peaceful Endowment in March 2022.

Yang\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe history for states to publicly attribute malicious cyber operations to an alleged accused is not long.¹ Although being the most frequent user of such policy tool, the US government's debut only came in 2014, when five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were indicted in a district court in the US, for hacking American companies for intellectual property.² A more prominent example is the denunciation made by the Biden Administration in 2021,³ also echoed by some of its allies,⁴ over China's Ministry of State Security for maintaining a network of criminal contract hackers responsible for the Microsoft Exchange Server attack that affected large group of worldwide users.\n\nNo wonder, after a state—either its governmental system or private businesses therein—suffers from malicious cyber operations by a foreign actor, it is tempting to identify and hold publicly accountable whoever it believes is responsible for that misbehavior. With an intention to deter malice and encourage order, such self-help effort can seemingly be of value to an underregulated cyberspace.\n\nWhen cyberspace just began to show its impact on international affairs, it was once a common fear that, with its unique architecture and operational process, \"the Internet is perfect for plausible deniability.\"⁵ The recent tide of public attribution—especially ill-substantiated ones among them—is no panacea against such fear, but rather seems to be a hypercorrection. For the international society, neither direction is satisfactory. The ultimate question to ask should then be: how to strike a balance between these conflicting interests, so that the bad agents in cyberspace cannot easily escape from penalty, while reckless public accusation also comes with a nonnegligible consequence.\n\n¹ To clarify, this Article uses the term \"cyber operation\" to incorporate different categories of cyber activities, including cyberattack which may amount to a use of force or armed attack in the sense of international law, and cyber espionage which refers to the large variety of below the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) activities in cyber \"grey zone,\" and also cyber-criminal activities, which does not trigger state responsibility in the strict and traditional sense, but may be changing in the cyber scenario.\n\nOn another note, this Article focuses on public attribution made by states. Entities other than states can also publicly attribute blame for a cyber operation, but for different aims and subject to different rules, if any. Private corporations, usually cyber security firms, may aim to enhance their influence, cultivate market demands, and ultimately cash out by selling products, services, and solutions on cybersecurity. Media may simply want an eye-catching story and may be easily manipulated by customized feeds of source information provided by enterprises or state organs. Since it falls outside of the purview of international law, the problem with these entities making public attribution merits a separate piece of analysis.\n\n² Dong et al. (2014).

Otherwise, it may incur extra problem, as any accuser naturally tends to point fingers rather recklessly if no effective curb exists. To illustrate, Sect. 14.2 will usher in a widely used analytical framework to dissect cyber public attribution process, point out the ill-substantiation problem, and demonstrate its destabilizing nature. Section 14.3 will focus on three types of legal deficiencies in extant international law that enable and encourage ill-substantiated public attribution. Section 14.4 will then propose the norm on responsible public attribution as a possible way forward.\n\n## The Problem with Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\n\n## Three-Dimension Framework to Interrogate Public Attribution\n\nThe effort of cyber public attribution entails three generally recognized considerations, which stem from technical, political, and legal perspectives, respectively.⁶\n\nFirst, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and restore the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is in large part a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber operation back to a machine or a location. Yet, pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires corroboration from human intelligence as well. It goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law.\n\nAlthough for tech experts like Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of a cyber security firm Crowdstrike, “identifying who is responsible … is now largely a solved problem,”⁷ states’ capabilities to associate an attack with a responsible party through technical means are far from evenly distributed.⁸ Asymmetric pattern of attribution practice can thus be deduced from such technical impurity, as the capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.⁹\n\nSecond, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decision to\n\n⁶ For pioneering work to review the exercise of “matching an offender to an offence … in minimizing uncertainty” on tactical, operational, and strategical levels. See Rid and Buchanan (2015).\n\n⁷ Alperovitch (2018).\n\n⁸ The impurity of cyber capabilities among states, including that to attribute, has been assessed and largely validated by many empirical studies. For one example, see The International Institute for Strategic Studies (2021).\n\n⁹ For chart illustrations covering the period of 2015–2020 verifying this deduction, see Garrett Derian-Toth et al. (2021). Not surprisingly, top five countries that made the most use of public attributions are all from Five Eyes Alliance, and China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been identified as the responsible actors for 75% of all state-sponsored offensive cyber operations.",

As has been righteously noted, this political decision making is “a highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.” The accusing state may be influenced by a complex matrix of political intentions, including, inter alia: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms.\n\nCompatible with this complexity, different forms of public attributions have also been developed for different case scenarios. The US, for example, can make public cyber attribution by indicting foreign criminal, imposing economic sanctions, sending out technical alerts, and issuing official statements or press releases. To sum up, a state's decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.\n\nThird, from a legal perspective, public attribution means imputation by connecting the offense to an offender according to applicable rules, either domestic or international. For purpose of this chapter, domestic imputation—such as indictment against foreign individuals—is left undiscussed; specific focus is put on cases intending to establish state responsibility as per applicable international law. Within this limit, legal attribution also serves as a basis to legitimize future responding measures, such as self-defense or other forms of countermeasures the accusing state may take, depending on the nature and severity of the original malicious cyber operations. Ideally, the international legal system should provide clear guidance regarding rules for attribution. However, the current body of international law is seriously inadequate on this issue, which, as will be explained, is the very root of the problem.\n\nIt's worthy to note that states may still publicly accuse others of conducting unwanted cyber operations regardless of any clear legal basis for doing so. For example, the US officially holds that political attribution in the form of official announcements does not require meeting any legal standards in the strict sense. This well reflects the complexity embedded within public attribution practice as to its diversified form and purpose.",

Conversely, however, public attribution is particularly susceptible to the problem of ill-substantiation, if not the absence of substantiation at all. The fundamental cause is that—to use the language of the three dimensions analytical framework—the political desire to publicly blame adversary state cannot be properly checked and balanced, due to technical impurity and the lack of legal restraints. Under strong political impetus to publicly blame the accused state, the technically capable state seems to enjoy taking advantage of the lawless status quo.\n\nThe term “ill-substantiated public attribution” is thereby specifically coined. It refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assigns responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. This problem lies in moving scale, rather than a simple yes-or-no judgment. As regards this concept, three illustrating points are necessary.\n\nFirst, the appropriate level of substantiation should match the purpose and form of public attribution.¹⁸ Take an extreme case as example. Here, a state is held publicly responsible for carrying out cyber operations that amount to an armed attack,¹⁹ activating the victim state’s right to self-defense. Obviously, such a claim is subject to challenge unless it can be unequivocally supported.²⁰ Another comparable situation occurs when there is a breach of general international legal obligation of non-intervention, and the accusing state aims to establish responsibility that can justify its future countermeasures. The requirement to prove this latter claim should be appropriately downsized.\n\nSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among two opposite camps of states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated.²¹ The US and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can thereby “act reasonably under the circumstances.”²² The most updated result of such contention is reflected in the 2021 report of the UN GGE, when it emphasized again that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful\n\n¹⁸ Some have noted that different purposes of public attribution relate to different levels of evidence. See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, p 558.\n¹⁹ It is a long-debated question as to when does cyber operations fall within the meaning of “armed attack” in the language of Art. 51 of UN Charter. See, e.g., Dev (2015).\n²⁰ Finlay and Payne (2019).\n²¹ China, Russia, et al. (2018).\n²² Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan (2017). Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.",

Solid substantiation brings positive yield, which helps to produce long-term credibility and stability. But it also means cost. The author tends not to go extreme on the requirement of substantiation, paying no attention to the constraint condition of cost. Against this backdrop, the law of diminishing marginal utility instructs that the logical deduction to stop is the point where marginal cost for extra substantiation cannot be covered by the added yield it may bring. As per this logic, the most productive phase in terms of legalization is exactly when the world moves from the lawless status quo to a more disciplined and transparent regime of public attribution.\n\n### Destabilizing Nature of Reckless Accusation\n\nAlthough public attribution per se will not necessarily pose a problem, the ill-substantiated public attribution is unhelpful in securing the political pursuits of the accusing state, as has been previously listed.\n\nPublic attribution is often justified as a policy tool to ease domestic pressure to react against a foreign malicious cyber operation. By telling a falsified or incomplete story, an ill-substantiated—and thus unhealthy—public attribution tends to exaggerate the efficiency and the fierceness of the authority, but seldom with satisfying answer from those crucified. This may breed populism, which will in turn squeeze the policy space.\n\nCritiques on the credibleness of cyber deterrence often builds on the observation that cyber attribution is difficult and manageable from the side of a hidden attacker. Making ill-substantiated public attribution would only worsen this situation, because reckless accusation is insufficient to legitimize possible responding measures from the deterring state, and therefore is a cheap form of signaling in the eyes of a potential adversary. By the same token, naming and shaming are unlikely to work as previously anticipated by the accusing state, because reckless finger-pointing may be interpreted as slandering and defamation.\n\nIn some cases, a state pursues to exert more deterring influence by bringing its ally to form a collective attribution. To clarify, a mere increase in the number of the accusing side is probably useful in making a fuss, but it will not enhance the legitimacy of an attribution. For each claim to stand, the robustness of the legal logic and the completeness of the evidence still play a decisive role.\n\nIll-substantiated public attribution contributes little—if not brings outright detriment—to norm-building, as it relies on the incompleteness of applicable rules. When a state deems itself in an advantageous position in the game of accusing",

The current asymmetrical pattern of ill-substantiated public attribution would thus be trapped in a deadlock at the best, and quite likely reinforce itself. This tendency is structurally destabilizing because, a constantly accusing state may make it normal to point fingers without enough substantiation, while a constantly accused state will grow increasingly resentful and eventually erupt. Ill-substantiated public attribution may increase the risk of a successful false-flag operation that incurs conflict.\n\n## Legal Deficiencies that Enable Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\n\nAs mentioned, international law serves as the basis to impute the accused state in relation to malicious cyber operations. State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law.²⁶ Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution.\n\nThe deficiencies are threefold: (1) international rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios; (2) international legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular; and (3) legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attribution are not clearly defined.\n\n## Attribution Rules\n\nGeneral international law recognizes that attribution rules have been compiled in International Law Commission’s draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), particularly Articles 4 through 11. ARSIWA was adopted by the UN General Assembly,²⁷ and is considered by both courts and commentators to be a fine codification of customary international law.²⁸ Linking state organs’ activity to that state as per ARSIWA proves to be less troublesome. But when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors, to ascribe the agency to a state agent is no easy task. Unfortunately, most of the cyber attributions are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate\n\n²⁶ Art. 2 of ARSIWA.\n\n²⁷ (28 Jan 2002) General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, UN Doc (A/RES/56/83). https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/56/83.\n\n²⁸ Crawford (2013).",

Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.\n\nRegarding the legal standard of the level of control required for attribution to occur, two generally recognized approaches[29] are the \"effective control\" test devised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,[30] and the \"overall control\" test developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Tadic decision.[31] Some argue that the \"overall control\" test should prevail in scenarios of cyber attribution, because the \"effective control\" test is far stricter and thus may function as \"a free pass to state sponsorship of cyberattacks.\"[32]\n\nThis proposal is far from a suitable solution for two reasons.[33] First, both of the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the nonstate actor, so that they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control. Second, the \"overall control\" standard was explicitly confined to \"organized and hierarchically structured groups\" such as military or paramilitary units,[34] while, as a matter of juridical fact, the stricter \"effective control\" test has been upheld in determining attribution concerning the acts of individuals or non-organized groups.\n\nConsidering how difficult it is to persuasively demonstrate that a state is effectively or generally controlling a nonstate entity, an alternative would be to hold states responsible for regulating or preventing unauthorized persons or groups from conducting malicious cyber operations within their jurisdictions. This potentially more qualified candidate of attribution rules is captured by the proposal to extend the application of \"due diligence\" in a cyber scenario. Due diligence is a notion first recognized by the ICJ in Corfu Channel.[35] Academic viewpoints among international lawyers are rather unanimous to import due diligence to cyber context, but are competing to categorize it as a primary rule of international obligation over state conduct,[36] or as a secondary rule to determine violation.[37]\n\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare defines due diligence as a substantive obligation[38]; the United Nations Group of Government Experts (UN GEE) report endorses this approach with similar\n\n[29] Ibid, pp 146–154.\n[30] Case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, the following six commonly recognized elements should be fulfilled: (1) The existence of acts (by a nonstate actor or a third state) contrary to the rights of a victim state; (2) which are conducted from or through the territory of the potentially responsible state (or from or through the territory or cyber infrastructure under its control); (3) which would have been unlawful if conducted by the potentially responsible state; (4) which have serious adverse consequences for the victim state; (5) with respect to which the potentially responsible state has actual or constructive knowledge; and (6) upon which the potentially responsible state can act, but fails to take all feasible measures.⁴⁰\n\nAmong them, the third element on the unlawfulness test deserves a separate note, especially under the backdrop of a recently appeared expansionist view. According to such a view, territorial state is imputable for certain malicious cyber operations, even though they cannot unquestionably be categorized as internationally wrongful acts for lack of clear primary rules in international law. Combatting ransomware is one such example. Traditionally, ransomware attack is understood as cybercrime, attributable only to private bodies. As cybercrime can easily cross multiple borders, to effectively combat ransomware highly depends on international coordination of law enforcement, but the failure of which should not lead to liability of the territorial state.\n\nRecent development has overthrown this legal setting when, since the first half year of 2021, an intensive series of ransomware attacks hit the infrastructure and livelihood business worldwide and especially the US. In particular, President Biden publicly alleged that “Russia has some responsibility to deal with this.”⁴¹ After a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on June 16, 2021, he escalated that rhetoric: “Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory.”⁴² Some commentators have taken an even more proactive stance. They suggested that as a due diligence obligation, Russia is responsible to curb ransomware gangs in its territory, otherwise the US can legitimately adopt countermeasures including sanctions or military cyber operations.⁴³ This signals a disturbing tendency to inappropriately broaden territorial state’s international obligation, for activities that happened inside its border that are harmful to another state, even when those activities would have not been unlawful if conducted by that territorial state.\n\n³⁹ The Group of Governmental Experts, Report on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n\n⁴⁰ See CCDCOE Cyberlaw Wiki, Due diligence. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Due_diligence.\n\n⁴¹ Remarks by President Biden on the Economy (2021).\n\n⁴² Remarks by President Biden in Press Conference (2021).\n\n⁴³ Harding et al. (2021); Goldsmith (2021). Note there are also other viewpoints justifying the US combating ransomware group in Russian territory as “self-help,” instead of as countermeasure as to Russia’s breach of due diligence obligation.

Yang\n\nTurning to the minority approach of due diligence as an attribution rule, the identification of the actual author shifts to that of state territory where those operations originate. According to such “indirect” or “imputed” attribution,[44] a state is held responsible for the cyber malicious operations harming another state rather than for a breach of its due diligence obligation, provided that the act was launched from computer systems located on its territory, and it failed to take feasible measures against the act. As this unorthodox approach seems a bit excessive, it is no wonder the UN GGE specifically pointed out that “the indication that an ICT [information and communications technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from a state’s territory or from its ICT infrastructure may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.”[45]\n\nIn light of these contending and confusing viewpoints, misusing and abusing “due diligence” to forge a legal logic to back up public attribution claims could facilitate ill-substantiation. It is thus important to reiterate the following points. First, “due diligence,” if imported to the cyber scenario, should be better understood as setting an obligation for a state rather than serving as a way to attribute. Second, the actual occurrence of a harmful cyber incident, which would have been unlawful if conducted by a potentially responsible state, is a prerequisite for the injured state to claim a due diligence violation. Third, even if state responsibility is successfully established along the legal path of due diligence, the responding measures that the accusing state might legitimately take should proportionately reflect the fact that the accused state did not conduct the malicious activities but, less harmfully, failed to address them with all feasible measures.\n\n## Evidentiary Requirements[46]\n\nGeneral international law has not yet developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence. Key evidentiary issues such as burden and standard of proof are normally evaluated on an ad hoc basis. For cyber disputes, such ambiguity can be interpreted as a loophole that allows states to carry out malicious cyber operations hoping for no consequence; or it can also be interpreted as an opportunity that allows states to sometimes make public attributions “reasonably under the circumstances,”[47] sometimes rather recklessly.\n\n[44] Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, p 91.\n[45] Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n[46] Some commentator deems the evidentiary requirement in legal argument on cyber issues as a deadlock problem, which has no solution, so long as one sticks to an interventionist approach to impose international law on cyber operations. See d'Aspremont (2016).\n[47] Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan BJ, op. cit. 22, p 177. Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.",

It is generally recognized that in \"a bilateral dispute over state responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant state.\"48 As a mechanism specifically tailored for cyber attribution, some proposed a shift of the burden of proof scheme, referred to as a \"virtual control\" test.49 The main argument behind this idea is that in cyber disputes, the territorial state for the alleged misbehavior has better access to the knowledge necessary to verify certain facts. By this mechanism, a prima facie responsibility would be established for the territorial state, unless it can provide evidence showing otherwise. It is not hard to imagine that this would probably cause more trouble than it intends to solve.50\n\nRegarding the standard of proof, a generally observed practice is that evidentiary standards should vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. Established ICJ cases also emphasized the importance to keep standard of proof transparent in the judgments.[51] Through a comparative assessment of international litigation, one can identify a few recognizable levels of hierarchy on standards of proof, largely borrowed from the domestic legal system of common law countries.[52]\n\nAs the highest level of requirement of standard of proof, \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" has its root in criminal cases and embodies the value of presumption of innocence. It requires a full chain of evidence, weighing together heavily toward one direction that forms a virtually indisputable claim. In international juridical forum, such standard is usually mandatory to substantiate a guilty verdict, as is made clear in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court regarding international criminal liability.[53] The ICJ held in a few of its cases that, \"claims against a state involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive...same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\"[54] Because a cyberattack amounts to an international crime with exceptional gravity, to substantiate its attribution should meet \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement.\n\nIn some cases, a preponderance of evidence is sufficient to support a legal claim. This lower level of requirement for the standard of proof concerns mainly the balance of probabilities of the two sides, which will favor the party with a more likely than not argument. In this regard, judges have vast discretionary power.

As self-defense is a legitimate exception against prohibition of using force, to substantiate a self-defense case—in normal or cyber scenario—should also adopt the “clear and convincing” standard.⁵⁷ In other regular cases, the amount of certainty the ICJ generally requires seems also to be clear and convincing evidence by parties.⁵⁸ To prove a cyber attribution regarding use of force, the “clear and convincing” standard is applicable, since “reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.”⁵⁹\n\nTo sum up, the international legal practice, mainly reflected by the ICJ’s case law, so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation.⁶⁰ Based on this premise, the adequate default level of evidence for cyber public attribution should better be set around “clear and convincing” standard, with a sliding scale from “preponderance evidence” up to “proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Exactly which standard prevails should match the severity of the claim on a case-by-case basis. One potential choice is to argue that cyber attribution for self-defense requires “clear and convincing” standard, while, for lower countermeasure level, the preponderance standard would suffice. However, this should not become a strict legal test, due to the complexity of real-life cases.\n\nApart from the complex standard of proof debate, a safer bottom line for the evidentiary requirement could be drawn from general principle of procedural law: in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking.⁶¹ Especially in cyber attribution cases, this can be a proper guideline to counterbalance a convenient excuse of the accusing state to justify its selective disclosure of limited material in the name of prevention of divulging intelligence secrets. It is an important mechanism to bolster an attribution’s credibility by providing sufficient evidence to allow the accused state and other potential stakeholders to confirm or debunk.⁶²\n\n⁵⁵ The Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Saldavor/Honduras), ICJ Judgment of 11 September 1992, para. 248; Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Pateh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore), ICJ Judgment of 23 May 2008, para. 86.\n\n⁵⁶ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, while most cyber public attribution cases will not ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and nature of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, “Even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.”[63] In the sense of facilitating customary law on evidentiary requirement, the formation of opinio juris may take some time, but it will never happen if the world is stuck to its current awkward status. The necessity and urgency are especially true for supporters of the “instant” international customary law.[64]\n\nAnother opposing viewpoint is that it is hard to reconcile the evidentiary requirement on cyber attribution on one hand with the necessity to make a timely attribution on the other.[65] This dilemma indeed exists. It should be subject to careful evaluation in a context-specific approach. Again, challenges in collecting and exhibiting evidence should not excuse evidence-less accusations.\n\n## Erroneous Attribution\n\nIf a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous—or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations—what legal consequences would the accusing state face? Underdevelopment of this legal issue will provide extra room for ill-substantiated public attribution, because no foreseeable punishment exists for irresponsible or erroneous allegations. However, current international law on this issue is tricky,[66] not to mention that technical hurdles against a confident attribution in cyber brings extra complexity to this problem.\n\nTo begin with, it is safe to infer that, once the attribution proves to be based on false facts, the international wrongfulness of the subsequent self-defense or countermeasure adopted by the accusing state cannot be unquestionably eliminated. In other words, the accusing state may be held responsible for taking unjustified steps against the accused state. As a counterargument, the accusing state may propose that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith. Could claims of “reasonableness” and “honesty” exonerate its false judgment?\n\n[63] Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 571–572.\n[64] Bin Cheng first put forward the notion of \"instant\" international customary law in a discussion on outer space law.

Yang\n\nPositive view is echoed by some scholarly papers$^{67}$ as well as official statements.$^{68}$ For example, Tallinn Manuel 2.0 explicitly asserts:\n\nthe exercise of the right of self-defense... is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made *ex ante*, not *ex post facto*. Their reasonableness will be assessed based upon the information available at the time they were made, not in light of information that subsequently becomes available.$^{69}$\n\nOther commentators opine that with good faith or not, wrongful attribution in the first place will nonetheless make subsequent measures the fruit of a poisonous tree. The ILC holds such view in its commentary to Article 49(1) of ARSIWA.$^{70}$ If, during an *ex post* examination, the attribution tends to be wrongful because of errors in *ex ante* factual assessment, the mistaken state may be responsible whether its agents had acted in good faith or not.$^{71}$\n\nLast but not least, what if the accusing state makes a public attribution that later proves wrong, but it does not take, concrete measures? Although the accused state does not suffer from the responding measures, but the harm to its fame and reputation has been inflicted. Under such circumstances, should the accusing state be held partially responsible for the false attribution, sometimes intentionally? Would belittlement of this question encourage even more ill-substantiated public attribution? This issue deserves more international discussion.\n\n## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution\n\nAgainst the challenges posed by ill-substantiated public attribution, tentative solutions should be sought as per the three dimensions analytical framework, with due consideration paid to technical, political, and legal dimensions, respectively. Contrary proposals have been made to establish a centralized international attribution mechanism,$^{72}$ and to keep the current system of decentralized public–private attributions working.$^{73}$ As this paper particularly takes the perspective of legal lens, an international norm on responsible state’s behavior in public attribution is thus proposed as a possible way forward.\n\nIn this regard, UN GGE has provided a sound basis by repeatedly emphasizing in its final reports that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts\n\n$^{67}$ Sklerov (2009).\n\n$^{68}$ The White House (2012).\n\n$^{69}$ Schmitt (2017b).\n\n$^{70}$ ARSIWA, Commentaries, art. 49(3).\n\n$^{71}$ Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 97–109.\n\n$^{72}$ Shany and Schmitt (2020).\n\n$^{73}$ Eichensehr (2019).",

Vis-à-vis the legal deficiencies previously identified, and bearing in mind the law of diminishing marginal utility, a norm on responsible public attribution should embody the following points.\n\n### Starting with an Out-of-The-Box Thought\n\nPrivate consultation before making cyber attribution public does not involve an ill-substantiation problem, as it will be confined in a confidential environment. If this becomes a mandatory preliminary step, improvement could be expected, because such procedural mechanism has proved to be useful in cutting down interstate disputes in other fields of international law. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a noticeable example. According to the relevant WTO rules, disputes are initiated through a formal request for consultations, whereby the complaining member invites the member whose measures are being challenged to discuss the disputed matter in order to resolve it without recourse to further litigation. Such consultation is mandatory, confidential, and with a time limit. If a similar mechanism exists in cyber conflict, the accusing state has a great chance to first consult privately with the accused state, channeling its interest demands without forcing the latter into an awkward position.\n\n### On Attribution Criteria\n\nState should refrain from removing key elements from due diligence rule to expand the coverage of another state's responsibility scope. Against the urgent need to cope with seriously damaging cybercrimes as ransomware, it may be too rash to argue straightforward for the existence of due diligence obligation to counter, in spite of no primary rule on such behavior. To better balance the position of the disputing states, and to better meet the challenge from ransomware and the like, it may be desirable to envisage a burden to investigate assumed by the accused state, provided that the accusing state can support its claim with satisfied evidence.",

It is recommended that private channels be used to demonstrate early evidence. In this way, the accusing state is able to send a credible signal about its awareness and knowledge of the malicious operation, while the accused state has enough policy space—and face—to maneuver.\n\n### On Legal Consequence\n\nIt should be clear that the international wrongfulness of the responding measures taken by the accusing state cannot be justified by attribution wrongfully made on the basis of error in factual assessment. More ideally, states should act with good faith not making unsolidified accusations.\n\nA combined norm on attribution rule, evidentiary requirement, and legal consequence of erroneous attribution could be termed as. (1) A state cannot be held internationally legally responsible solely for an ICT activity launched or otherwise originates from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. (2) A state should substantiate its public attribution with adequate level evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a “clear and convincing” case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. (3) A state should refrain from taking responding measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making erroneous or falsified attribution.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStrictly, the attribution under international law is but one of the two indispensable components in determining internationally wrongful acts, the other being the breach of an international obligation. A thorough discussion of attribution cannot do without addressing primary rules on cyber operations, either. This has been shown in previous analysis regarding due diligence. But still, the attribution discussion bears meaning, especially when it relates to some important legal deficiencies.\n\nRecent development is featured by the states beginning to favor public attribution as a policy tool.

Helpful in understanding such attribution practice are three commonly recognized dimensions, respectively, from technical, political, and legal perspectives. Compared to confidentially processed attribution, to publicly blame a state should be better substantiated. But as legal deficiencies in the current body of international law, apart from also some technical obstacles, cannot live up to the political desire of the accuser to make public attribution, the ill-substantiation problem becomes prominent. Debates over the \"control test\" and misuse of due diligence principle in cyber scenarios extend the responsibility scope of the territorial state. Lack of essential evidentiary requirements cripples the predictability and falsifiability for bringing up accusation. Inculpability for erroneous attribution invites the accusing state's recklessness. In light of these legal deficiencies, an international norm on responsible state behavior for public attribution could be a promising way forward.\nKeywords Ill-Substantiated public attribution  $\\cdot$  Due diligence  $\\cdot$  Evidentiary requirements  $\\cdot$  Erroneous attribution  $\\cdot$  Responsible state behavior\nThis chapter is a fully revised and expanded article developed with permission from the author's earlier contribution to a research report on Managing U.S.-China Tensions Over Public Cyber Attribution, published by Carnegie Peaceful Endowment in March 2022.

Yang\n# Introduction\nThe history for states to publicly attribute malicious cyber operations to an alleged accused is not long.¹ Although being the most frequent user of such policy tool, the US government's debut only came in 2014, when five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were indicted in a district court in the US, for hacking American companies for intellectual property.² A more prominent example is the denunciation made by the Biden Administration in 2021,³ also echoed by some of its allies,⁴ over China's Ministry of State Security for maintaining a network of criminal contract hackers responsible for the Microsoft Exchange Server attack that affected large group of worldwide users.\nNo wonder, after a state—either its governmental system or private businesses therein—suffers from malicious cyber operations by a foreign actor, it is tempting to identify and hold publicly accountable whoever it believes is responsible for that misbehavior. With an intention to deter malice and encourage order, such self-help effort can seemingly be of value to an underregulated cyberspace.\nWhen cyberspace just began to show its impact on international affairs, it was once a common fear that, with its unique architecture and operational process, \"the Internet is perfect for plausible deniability.\"⁵ The recent tide of public attribution—especially ill-substantiated ones among them—is no panacea against such fear, but rather seems to be a hypercorrection. For the international society, neither direction is satisfactory. The ultimate question to ask should then be: how to strike a balance between these conflicting interests, so that the bad agents in cyberspace cannot easily escape from penalty, while reckless public accusation also comes with a nonnegligible consequence.\n¹ To clarify, this Article uses the term \"cyber operation\" to incorporate different categories of cyber activities, including cyberattack which may amount to a use of force or armed attack in the sense of international law, and cyber espionage which refers to the large variety of below the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) activities in cyber \"grey zone,\" and also cyber-criminal activities, which does not trigger state responsibility in the strict and traditional sense, but may be changing in the cyber scenario.\nOn another note, this Article focuses on public attribution made by states. Entities other than states can also publicly attribute blame for a cyber operation, but for different aims and subject to different rules, if any. Private corporations, usually cyber security firms, may aim to enhance their influence, cultivate market demands, and ultimately cash out by selling products, services, and solutions on cybersecurity. Media may simply want an eye-catching story and may be easily manipulated by customized feeds of source information provided by enterprises or state organs. Since it falls outside of the purview of international law, the problem with these entities making public attribution merits a separate piece of analysis.\n² Dong et al. (2014). Some commentator coined this as \"attribution by indictment,\" see Keitner (2019).\n³ The White House (2021).\n⁴ Among them are the EU, NATO, and UK. See, e.g., Council of the EU (2021, UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, National Cyber Security Centre, and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP (2021), NATO (2021).\n⁵ Brenner (2009).\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\nFor the latter part of the query, this article would propose that public attribution requires a timely calibration especially from the legal viewpoint. Otherwise, it may incur extra problem, as any accuser naturally tends to point fingers rather recklessly if no effective curb exists. To illustrate, Sect. 14.2 will usher in a widely used analytical framework to dissect cyber public attribution process, point out the ill-substantiation problem, and demonstrate its destabilizing nature. Section 14.3 will focus on three types of legal deficiencies in extant international law that enable and encourage ill-substantiated public attribution. Section 14.4 will then propose the norm on responsible public attribution as a possible way forward.\n## The Problem with Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\n## Three-Dimension Framework to Interrogate Public Attribution\nThe effort of cyber public attribution entails three generally recognized considerations, which stem from technical, political, and legal perspectives, respectively.⁶\nFirst, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and restore the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is in large part a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber operation back to a machine or a location. Yet, pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires corroboration from human intelligence as well. It goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law.\nAlthough for tech experts like Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of a cyber security firm Crowdstrike, “identifying who is responsible … is now largely a solved problem,”⁷ states’ capabilities to associate an attack with a responsible party through technical means are far from evenly distributed.⁸ Asymmetric pattern of attribution practice can thus be deduced from such technical impurity, as the capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.⁹\nSecond, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decision to\n⁶ For pioneering work to review the exercise of “matching an offender to an offence … in minimizing uncertainty” on tactical, operational, and strategical levels. See Rid and Buchanan (2015).\n⁷ Alperovitch (2018).\n⁸ The impurity of cyber capabilities among states, including that to attribute, has been assessed and largely validated by many empirical studies. For one example, see The International Institute for Strategic Studies (2021).\n⁹ For chart illustrations covering the period of 2015–2020 verifying this deduction, see Garrett Derian-Toth et al. (2021). Not surprisingly, top five countries that made the most use of public attributions are all from Five Eyes Alliance, and China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been identified as the responsible actors for 75% of all state-sponsored offensive cyber operations.\nmake, such as whether, when and in what form to publicly hold the actor accountable, or whether to call for coordinated actions from allies. As has been righteously noted, this political decision making is “a highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.” The accusing state may be influenced by a complex matrix of political intentions, including, inter alia: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms.\nCompatible with this complexity, different forms of public attributions have also been developed for different case scenarios. The US, for example, can make public cyber attribution by indicting foreign criminal, imposing economic sanctions, sending out technical alerts, and issuing official statements or press releases. To sum up, a state's decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.\nThird, from a legal perspective, public attribution means imputation by connecting the offense to an offender according to applicable rules, either domestic or international. For purpose of this chapter, domestic imputation—such as indictment against foreign individuals—is left undiscussed; specific focus is put on cases intending to establish state responsibility as per applicable international law. Within this limit, legal attribution also serves as a basis to legitimize future responding measures, such as self-defense or other forms of countermeasures the accusing state may take, depending on the nature and severity of the original malicious cyber operations. Ideally, the international legal system should provide clear guidance regarding rules for attribution. However, the current body of international law is seriously inadequate on this issue, which, as will be explained, is the very root of the problem.\nIt's worthy to note that states may still publicly accuse others of conducting unwanted cyber operations regardless of any clear legal basis for doing so. For example, the US officially holds that political attribution in the form of official announcements does not require meeting any legal standards in the strict sense. This well reflects the complexity embedded within public attribution practice as to its diversified form and purpose.\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\n## Substantiation as the Problem\nCompared to attribution that is confidentially processed and privately communicated, it is only logical that public attribution should be better supported. Conversely, however, public attribution is particularly susceptible to the problem of ill-substantiation, if not the absence of substantiation at all. The fundamental cause is that—to use the language of the three dimensions analytical framework—the political desire to publicly blame adversary state cannot be properly checked and balanced, due to technical impurity and the lack of legal restraints. Under strong political impetus to publicly blame the accused state, the technically capable state seems to enjoy taking advantage of the lawless status quo.\nThe term “ill-substantiated public attribution” is thereby specifically coined. It refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assigns responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. This problem lies in moving scale, rather than a simple yes-or-no judgment. As regards this concept, three illustrating points are necessary.\nFirst, the appropriate level of substantiation should match the purpose and form of public attribution.¹⁸ Take an extreme case as example. Here, a state is held publicly responsible for carrying out cyber operations that amount to an armed attack,¹⁹ activating the victim state’s right to self-defense. Obviously, such a claim is subject to challenge unless it can be unequivocally supported.²⁰ Another comparable situation occurs when there is a breach of general international legal obligation of non-intervention, and the accusing state aims to establish responsibility that can justify its future countermeasures. The requirement to prove this latter claim should be appropriately downsized.\nSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among two opposite camps of states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated.²¹ The US and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can thereby “act reasonably under the circumstances.”²² The most updated result of such contention is reflected in the 2021 report of the UN GGE, when it emphasized again that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful\n¹⁸ Some have noted that different purposes of public attribution relate to different levels of evidence. See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, p 558.\n¹⁹ It is a long-debated question as to when does cyber operations fall within the meaning of “armed attack” in the language of Art. 51 of UN Charter. See, e.g., Dev (2015).\n²⁰ Finlay and Payne (2019).\n²¹ China, Russia, et al. (2018).\n²² Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan (2017). Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\nacts brought against states should be substantiated.” The connotation that only verified accusation stands is clear, but the \"how\" question remains untouched.\nThird, ill-substantiated public attribution problem should be addressed in marginal sense rather than in average or absolute sense. Solid substantiation brings positive yield, which helps to produce long-term credibility and stability. But it also means cost. The author tends not to go extreme on the requirement of substantiation, paying no attention to the constraint condition of cost. Against this backdrop, the law of diminishing marginal utility instructs that the logical deduction to stop is the point where marginal cost for extra substantiation cannot be covered by the added yield it may bring. As per this logic, the most productive phase in terms of legalization is exactly when the world moves from the lawless status quo to a more disciplined and transparent regime of public attribution.\n### Destabilizing Nature of Reckless Accusation\nAlthough public attribution per se will not necessarily pose a problem, the ill-substantiated public attribution is unhelpful in securing the political pursuits of the accusing state, as has been previously listed.\nPublic attribution is often justified as a policy tool to ease domestic pressure to react against a foreign malicious cyber operation. By telling a falsified or incomplete story, an ill-substantiated—and thus unhealthy—public attribution tends to exaggerate the efficiency and the fierceness of the authority, but seldom with satisfying answer from those crucified. This may breed populism, which will in turn squeeze the policy space.\nCritiques on the credibleness of cyber deterrence often builds on the observation that cyber attribution is difficult and manageable from the side of a hidden attacker. Making ill-substantiated public attribution would only worsen this situation, because reckless accusation is insufficient to legitimize possible responding measures from the deterring state, and therefore is a cheap form of signaling in the eyes of a potential adversary. By the same token, naming and shaming are unlikely to work as previously anticipated by the accusing state, because reckless finger-pointing may be interpreted as slandering and defamation.\nIn some cases, a state pursues to exert more deterring influence by bringing its ally to form a collective attribution. To clarify, a mere increase in the number of the accusing side is probably useful in making a fuss, but it will not enhance the legitimacy of an attribution. For each claim to stand, the robustness of the legal logic and the completeness of the evidence still play a decisive role.\nIll-substantiated public attribution contributes little—if not brings outright detriment—to norm-building, as it relies on the incompleteness of applicable rules. When a state deems itself in an advantageous position in the game of accusing\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\n287\nversus accused, it will not have enough impetus to push forward a more elaborate set of rules governing cyber attribution. The current asymmetrical pattern of ill-substantiated public attribution would thus be trapped in a deadlock at the best, and quite likely reinforce itself. This tendency is structurally destabilizing because, a constantly accusing state may make it normal to point fingers without enough substantiation, while a constantly accused state will grow increasingly resentful and eventually erupt. Ill-substantiated public attribution may increase the risk of a successful false-flag operation that incurs conflict.\n## Legal Deficiencies that Enable Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\nAs mentioned, international law serves as the basis to impute the accused state in relation to malicious cyber operations. State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law.²⁶ Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution.\nThe deficiencies are threefold: (1) international rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios; (2) international legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular; and (3) legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attribution are not clearly defined.\n## Attribution Rules\nGeneral international law recognizes that attribution rules have been compiled in International Law Commission’s draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), particularly Articles 4 through 11. ARSIWA was adopted by the UN General Assembly,²⁷ and is considered by both courts and commentators to be a fine codification of customary international law.²⁸ Linking state organs’ activity to that state as per ARSIWA proves to be less troublesome. But when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors, to ascribe the agency to a state agent is no easy task. Unfortunately, most of the cyber attributions are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate\n²⁶ Art. 2 of ARSIWA.\n²⁷ (28 Jan 2002) General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, UN Doc (A/RES/56/83). https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/56/83.\n²⁸ Crawford (2013).\nF. Yang\nactor's behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial. Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.\nRegarding the legal standard of the level of control required for attribution to occur, two generally recognized approaches[29] are the \"effective control\" test devised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,[30] and the \"overall control\" test developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Tadic decision.[31] Some argue that the \"overall control\" test should prevail in scenarios of cyber attribution, because the \"effective control\" test is far stricter and thus may function as \"a free pass to state sponsorship of cyberattacks.\"[32]\nThis proposal is far from a suitable solution for two reasons.[33] First, both of the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the nonstate actor, so that they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control. Second, the \"overall control\" standard was explicitly confined to \"organized and hierarchically structured groups\" such as military or paramilitary units,[34] while, as a matter of juridical fact, the stricter \"effective control\" test has been upheld in determining attribution concerning the acts of individuals or non-organized groups.\nConsidering how difficult it is to persuasively demonstrate that a state is effectively or generally controlling a nonstate entity, an alternative would be to hold states responsible for regulating or preventing unauthorized persons or groups from conducting malicious cyber operations within their jurisdictions. This potentially more qualified candidate of attribution rules is captured by the proposal to extend the application of \"due diligence\" in a cyber scenario. Due diligence is a notion first recognized by the ICJ in Corfu Channel.[35] Academic viewpoints among international lawyers are rather unanimous to import due diligence to cyber context, but are competing to categorize it as a primary rule of international obligation over state conduct,[36] or as a secondary rule to determine violation.[37]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare defines due diligence as a substantive obligation[38]; the United Nations Group of Government Experts (UN GEE) report endorses this approach with similar\n[29] Ibid, pp 146–154.\n[30] Case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA), Merits, (27 Jun 1986) ICJ Report.\n[31] Prosecutor v. Tadic, Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 Oct 1995) (ICTY-94-1-AR72).\n[32] Shackleford and Andres (2010).\n[33] Lahmann (2020).\n[34] Prosecutor v. Tadic, paras. 131, 137.\n[35] The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Merits, ICJ Report, 1949.\n[36] Shackelford et al. (2016), Jensen and Watts (2021).\n[37] Mackenzie and Scott (2021), Chircop (2018).\n[38] Schmitt (2017a), Rule 6. The rule reads: \"State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other states.\"\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\nwording.³⁹ Per this understanding, the original task of attributing malicious cyber operations to a territorial state no longer requires an answer. A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, the following six commonly recognized elements should be fulfilled: (1) The existence of acts (by a nonstate actor or a third state) contrary to the rights of a victim state; (2) which are conducted from or through the territory of the potentially responsible state (or from or through the territory or cyber infrastructure under its control); (3) which would have been unlawful if conducted by the potentially responsible state; (4) which have serious adverse consequences for the victim state; (5) with respect to which the potentially responsible state has actual or constructive knowledge; and (6) upon which the potentially responsible state can act, but fails to take all feasible measures.⁴⁰\nAmong them, the third element on the unlawfulness test deserves a separate note, especially under the backdrop of a recently appeared expansionist view. According to such a view, territorial state is imputable for certain malicious cyber operations, even though they cannot unquestionably be categorized as internationally wrongful acts for lack of clear primary rules in international law. Combatting ransomware is one such example. Traditionally, ransomware attack is understood as cybercrime, attributable only to private bodies. As cybercrime can easily cross multiple borders, to effectively combat ransomware highly depends on international coordination of law enforcement, but the failure of which should not lead to liability of the territorial state.\nRecent development has overthrown this legal setting when, since the first half year of 2021, an intensive series of ransomware attacks hit the infrastructure and livelihood business worldwide and especially the US. In particular, President Biden publicly alleged that “Russia has some responsibility to deal with this.”⁴¹ After a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on June 16, 2021, he escalated that rhetoric: “Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory.”⁴² Some commentators have taken an even more proactive stance. They suggested that as a due diligence obligation, Russia is responsible to curb ransomware gangs in its territory, otherwise the US can legitimately adopt countermeasures including sanctions or military cyber operations.⁴³ This signals a disturbing tendency to inappropriately broaden territorial state’s international obligation, for activities that happened inside its border that are harmful to another state, even when those activities would have not been unlawful if conducted by that territorial state.\n³⁹ The Group of Governmental Experts, Report on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n⁴⁰ See CCDCOE Cyberlaw Wiki, Due diligence. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Due_diligence.\n⁴¹ Remarks by President Biden on the Economy (2021).\n⁴² Remarks by President Biden in Press Conference (2021).\n⁴³ Harding et al. (2021); Goldsmith (2021). Note there are also other viewpoints justifying the US combating ransomware group in Russian territory as “self-help,” instead of as countermeasure as to Russia’s breach of due diligence obligation. See Corn (2021).\nF. Yang\nTurning to the minority approach of due diligence as an attribution rule, the identification of the actual author shifts to that of state territory where those operations originate. According to such “indirect” or “imputed” attribution,[44] a state is held responsible for the cyber malicious operations harming another state rather than for a breach of its due diligence obligation, provided that the act was launched from computer systems located on its territory, and it failed to take feasible measures against the act. As this unorthodox approach seems a bit excessive, it is no wonder the UN GGE specifically pointed out that “the indication that an ICT [information and communications technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from a state’s territory or from its ICT infrastructure may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.”[45]\nIn light of these contending and confusing viewpoints, misusing and abusing “due diligence” to forge a legal logic to back up public attribution claims could facilitate ill-substantiation. It is thus important to reiterate the following points. First, “due diligence,” if imported to the cyber scenario, should be better understood as setting an obligation for a state rather than serving as a way to attribute. Second, the actual occurrence of a harmful cyber incident, which would have been unlawful if conducted by a potentially responsible state, is a prerequisite for the injured state to claim a due diligence violation. Third, even if state responsibility is successfully established along the legal path of due diligence, the responding measures that the accusing state might legitimately take should proportionately reflect the fact that the accused state did not conduct the malicious activities but, less harmfully, failed to address them with all feasible measures.\n## Evidentiary Requirements[46]\nGeneral international law has not yet developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence. Key evidentiary issues such as burden and standard of proof are normally evaluated on an ad hoc basis. For cyber disputes, such ambiguity can be interpreted as a loophole that allows states to carry out malicious cyber operations hoping for no consequence; or it can also be interpreted as an opportunity that allows states to sometimes make public attributions “reasonably under the circumstances,”[47] sometimes rather recklessly.\n[44] Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, p 91.\n[45] Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n[46] Some commentator deems the evidentiary requirement in legal argument on cyber issues as a deadlock problem, which has no solution, so long as one sticks to an interventionist approach to impose international law on cyber operations. See d'Aspremont (2016).\n[47] Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan BJ, op. cit. 22, p 177. Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\nOf those two evidentiary issues, burden of proof is less controversial. It is generally recognized that in \"a bilateral dispute over state responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant state.\"48 As a mechanism specifically tailored for cyber attribution, some proposed a shift of the burden of proof scheme, referred to as a \"virtual control\" test.49 The main argument behind this idea is that in cyber disputes, the territorial state for the alleged misbehavior has better access to the knowledge necessary to verify certain facts. By this mechanism, a prima facie responsibility would be established for the territorial state, unless it can provide evidence showing otherwise. It is not hard to imagine that this would probably cause more trouble than it intends to solve.50\nRegarding the standard of proof, a generally observed practice is that evidentiary standards should vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. Established ICJ cases also emphasized the importance to keep standard of proof transparent in the judgments.[51] Through a comparative assessment of international litigation, one can identify a few recognizable levels of hierarchy on standards of proof, largely borrowed from the domestic legal system of common law countries.[52]\nAs the highest level of requirement of standard of proof, \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" has its root in criminal cases and embodies the value of presumption of innocence. It requires a full chain of evidence, weighing together heavily toward one direction that forms a virtually indisputable claim. In international juridical forum, such standard is usually mandatory to substantiate a guilty verdict, as is made clear in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court regarding international criminal liability.[53] The ICJ held in a few of its cases that, \"claims against a state involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive...same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\"[54] Because a cyberattack amounts to an international crime with exceptional gravity, to substantiate its attribution should meet \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement.\nIn some cases, a preponderance of evidence is sufficient to support a legal claim. This lower level of requirement for the standard of proof concerns mainly the balance of probabilities of the two sides, which will favor the party with a more likely than not argument. In this regard, judges have vast discretionary power. As a result, extant\n48 ARSIWA, Commentaries, Chapter V, p 8.\n49 Margulies (2015).\n50 Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 93–97.\n51 Oil Platforms (Iran v. U. S.), ICJ Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para. 33.\n52 Green (2009).\n53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Article 66(3).\n54 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2007, p. 90, para. 209.\nF. Yang\ncases that adopt \"preponderance standard\" exclusively address territory issues, which rarely involve state responsibility.⁵⁵\nWith some room for debate, the ICJ cases and state practices support the “clear and convincing” standard for cases on use of force.⁵⁶ This requirement for the standard of proof lies in between preponderance and beyond-reasonable-doubt standard. As self-defense is a legitimate exception against prohibition of using force, to substantiate a self-defense case—in normal or cyber scenario—should also adopt the “clear and convincing” standard.⁵⁷ In other regular cases, the amount of certainty the ICJ generally requires seems also to be clear and convincing evidence by parties.⁵⁸ To prove a cyber attribution regarding use of force, the “clear and convincing” standard is applicable, since “reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.”⁵⁹\nTo sum up, the international legal practice, mainly reflected by the ICJ’s case law, so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation.⁶⁰ Based on this premise, the adequate default level of evidence for cyber public attribution should better be set around “clear and convincing” standard, with a sliding scale from “preponderance evidence” up to “proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Exactly which standard prevails should match the severity of the claim on a case-by-case basis. One potential choice is to argue that cyber attribution for self-defense requires “clear and convincing” standard, while, for lower countermeasure level, the preponderance standard would suffice. However, this should not become a strict legal test, due to the complexity of real-life cases.\nApart from the complex standard of proof debate, a safer bottom line for the evidentiary requirement could be drawn from general principle of procedural law: in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking.⁶¹ Especially in cyber attribution cases, this can be a proper guideline to counterbalance a convenient excuse of the accusing state to justify its selective disclosure of limited material in the name of prevention of divulging intelligence secrets. It is an important mechanism to bolster an attribution’s credibility by providing sufficient evidence to allow the accused state and other potential stakeholders to confirm or debunk.⁶²\n⁵⁵ The Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Saldavor/Honduras), ICJ Judgment of 11 September 1992, para. 248; Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Pateh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore), ICJ Judgment of 23 May 2008, para. 86.\n⁵⁶ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, while most cyber public attribution cases will not ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and nature of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, “Even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.”[63] In the sense of facilitating customary law on evidentiary requirement, the formation of opinio juris may take some time, but it will never happen if the world is stuck to its current awkward status. The necessity and urgency are especially true for supporters of the “instant” international customary law.[64]\nAnother opposing viewpoint is that it is hard to reconcile the evidentiary requirement on cyber attribution on one hand with the necessity to make a timely attribution on the other.[65] This dilemma indeed exists. It should be subject to careful evaluation in a context-specific approach. Again, challenges in collecting and exhibiting evidence should not excuse evidence-less accusations.\n## Erroneous Attribution\nIf a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous—or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations—what legal consequences would the accusing state face? Underdevelopment of this legal issue will provide extra room for ill-substantiated public attribution, because no foreseeable punishment exists for irresponsible or erroneous allegations. However, current international law on this issue is tricky,[66] not to mention that technical hurdles against a confident attribution in cyber brings extra complexity to this problem.\nTo begin with, it is safe to infer that, once the attribution proves to be based on false facts, the international wrongfulness of the subsequent self-defense or countermeasure adopted by the accusing state cannot be unquestionably eliminated. In other words, the accusing state may be held responsible for taking unjustified steps against the accused state. As a counterargument, the accusing state may propose that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith. Could claims of “reasonableness” and “honesty” exonerate its false judgment?\n[63] Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 571–572.\n[64] Bin Cheng first put forward the notion of \"instant\" international customary law in a discussion on outer space law. See Bin Cheng, United Nations Resolutions on Outer Space: ‘Instant’ International Customary Law? In: Bin Cheng (1997).\n[65] Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 32.\n[66] Milanovic (2020).\nF. Yang\nPositive view is echoed by some scholarly papers$^{67}$ as well as official statements.$^{68}$ For example, Tallinn Manuel 2.0 explicitly asserts:\nthe exercise of the right of self-defense... is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made *ex ante*, not *ex post facto*. Their reasonableness will be assessed based upon the information available at the time they were made, not in light of information that subsequently becomes available.$^{69}$\nOther commentators opine that with good faith or not, wrongful attribution in the first place will nonetheless make subsequent measures the fruit of a poisonous tree. The ILC holds such view in its commentary to Article 49(1) of ARSIWA.$^{70}$ If, during an *ex post* examination, the attribution tends to be wrongful because of errors in *ex ante* factual assessment, the mistaken state may be responsible whether its agents had acted in good faith or not.$^{71}$\nLast but not least, what if the accusing state makes a public attribution that later proves wrong, but it does not take, concrete measures? Although the accused state does not suffer from the responding measures, but the harm to its fame and reputation has been inflicted. Under such circumstances, should the accusing state be held partially responsible for the false attribution, sometimes intentionally? Would belittlement of this question encourage even more ill-substantiated public attribution? This issue deserves more international discussion.\n## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution\nAgainst the challenges posed by ill-substantiated public attribution, tentative solutions should be sought as per the three dimensions analytical framework, with due consideration paid to technical, political, and legal dimensions, respectively. Contrary proposals have been made to establish a centralized international attribution mechanism,$^{72}$ and to keep the current system of decentralized public–private attributions working.$^{73}$ As this paper particularly takes the perspective of legal lens, an international norm on responsible state’s behavior in public attribution is thus proposed as a possible way forward.\nIn this regard, UN GGE has provided a sound basis by repeatedly emphasizing in its final reports that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts\n$^{67}$ Sklerov (2009).\n$^{68}$ The White House (2012).\n$^{69}$ Schmitt (2017b).\n$^{70}$ ARSIWA, Commentaries, art. 49(3).\n$^{71}$ Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 97–109.\n$^{72}$ Shany and Schmitt (2020).\n$^{73}$ Eichensehr (2019).\nbrought against states should be substantiated.” Righteous in its nature though, this norm only points out the need for accusations to be substantiated but fails to elaborate how. Vis-à-vis the legal deficiencies previously identified, and bearing in mind the law of diminishing marginal utility, a norm on responsible public attribution should embody the following points.\n### Starting with an Out-of-The-Box Thought\nPrivate consultation before making cyber attribution public does not involve an ill-substantiation problem, as it will be confined in a confidential environment. If this becomes a mandatory preliminary step, improvement could be expected, because such procedural mechanism has proved to be useful in cutting down interstate disputes in other fields of international law. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a noticeable example. According to the relevant WTO rules, disputes are initiated through a formal request for consultations, whereby the complaining member invites the member whose measures are being challenged to discuss the disputed matter in order to resolve it without recourse to further litigation. Such consultation is mandatory, confidential, and with a time limit. If a similar mechanism exists in cyber conflict, the accusing state has a great chance to first consult privately with the accused state, channeling its interest demands without forcing the latter into an awkward position.\n### On Attribution Criteria\nState should refrain from removing key elements from due diligence rule to expand the coverage of another state's responsibility scope. Against the urgent need to cope with seriously damaging cybercrimes as ransomware, it may be too rash to argue straightforward for the existence of due diligence obligation to counter, in spite of no primary rule on such behavior. To better balance the position of the disputing states, and to better meet the challenge from ransomware and the like, it may be desirable to envisage a burden to investigate assumed by the accused state, provided that the accusing state can support its claim with satisfied evidence.\nOn Evidentiary Requirement\nThe standards of proof should be set in principle by the “clear and convincing” test, and shall increase as the seriousness of the accusation enhances. It is recommended that private channels be used to demonstrate early evidence. In this way, the accusing state is able to send a credible signal about its awareness and knowledge of the malicious operation, while the accused state has enough policy space—and face—to maneuver.\n### On Legal Consequence\nIt should be clear that the international wrongfulness of the responding measures taken by the accusing state cannot be justified by attribution wrongfully made on the basis of error in factual assessment. More ideally, states should act with good faith not making unsolidified accusations.\nA combined norm on attribution rule, evidentiary requirement, and legal consequence of erroneous attribution could be termed as. (1) A state cannot be held internationally legally responsible solely for an ICT activity launched or otherwise originates from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. (2) A state should substantiate its public attribution with adequate level evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a “clear and convincing” case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. (3) A state should refrain from taking responding measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making erroneous or falsified attribution.\n## Conclusion\nStrictly, the attribution under international law is but one of the two indispensable components in determining internationally wrongful acts, the other being the breach of an international obligation. A thorough discussion of attribution cannot do without addressing primary rules on cyber operations, either. This has been shown in previous analysis regarding due diligence. But still, the attribution discussion bears meaning, especially when it relates to some important legal deficiencies.\nRecent development is featured by the states beginning to favor public attribution as a policy tool. France consistently holds a cautious attitude toward public attribution, when it views naming an enemy, especially if it is a sovereign state, as a political act that requires highest level of decision. When France officially\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\nattributed a cyberattack for the first time, $^{78}$  in July 2021, it represents \"a subtle shift in the implementation of its attribution strategy.\" $^{79}$  China, the most frequent receiver of cyber public attributions, also made its first practice in 2021 through a private cyber security firm, claiming Indian source malicious cyber operations have been trying to infiltrate into sensitive zones within China's cyber domain. $^{80}$\nAgainst this backdrop, the expected marginal benefit from substantiated claims would greatly outweigh the marginal cost to substantiate the claim according to a set of commonly acceptable codes of conduct. A norm on responsible public attribution may be just on time to save the world from a chaotic blame game.\nAcknowledgements The author would extend the deepest appreciation to George Perkovich, Ariel Levite, Jon Bateman, Scott Collard, June Lee from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to Chuanying Lu, Manshu Xu from Shanghai Institute for International Studies, and to Yan Li from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, for their insightful critiques on earlier drafts of this Article.",

Helpful in understanding such attribution practice are three commonly recognized dimensions, respectively, from technical, political, and legal perspectives. Compared to confidentially processed attribution, to publicly blame a state should be better substantiated. But as legal deficiencies in the current body of international law, apart from also some technical obstacles, cannot live up to the political desire of the accuser to make public attribution, the ill-substantiation problem becomes prominent. Debates over the \"control test\" and misuse of due diligence principle in cyber scenarios extend the responsibility scope of the territorial state. Lack of essential evidentiary requirements cripples the predictability and falsifiability for bringing up accusation. Inculpability for erroneous attribution invites the accusing state's recklessness. In light of these legal deficiencies, an international norm on responsible state behavior for public attribution could be a promising way forward.\nKeywords Ill-Substantiated public attribution  $\\cdot$  Due diligence  $\\cdot$  Evidentiary requirements  $\\cdot$  Erroneous attribution  $\\cdot$  Responsible state behavior\nThis chapter is a fully revised and expanded article developed with permission from the author's earlier contribution to a research report on Managing U.S.-China Tensions Over Public Cyber Attribution, published by Carnegie Peaceful Endowment in March 2022.

Yang\n# Introduction\nThe history for states to publicly attribute malicious cyber operations to an alleged accused is not long. Although being the most frequent user of such policy tool, the US government's debut only came in 2014, when five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were indicted in a district court in the US, for hacking American companies for intellectual property. A more prominent example is the denunciation made by the Biden Administration in 2021, also echoed by some of its allies, over China's Ministry of State Security for maintaining a network of criminal contract hackers responsible for the Microsoft Exchange Server attack that affected large group of worldwide users.\nNo wonder, after a state—either its governmental system or private businesses therein—suffers from malicious cyber operations by a foreign actor, it is tempting to identify and hold publicly accountable whoever it believes is responsible for that misbehavior. With an intention to deter malice and encourage order, such self-help effort can seemingly be of value to an underregulated cyberspace.\nWhen cyberspace just began to show its impact on international affairs, it was once a common fear that, with its unique architecture and operational process, \"the Internet is perfect for plausible deniability.\" The recent tide of public attribution—especially ill-substantiated ones among them—is no panacea against such fear, but rather seems to be a hypercorrection. For the international society, neither direction is satisfactory. The ultimate question to ask should then be: how to strike a balance between these conflicting interests, so that the bad agents in cyberspace cannot easily escape from penalty, while reckless public accusation also comes with a nonnegligible consequence.\n To clarify, this Article uses the term \"cyber operation\" to incorporate different categories of cyber activities, including cyberattack which may amount to a use of force or armed attack in the sense of international law, and cyber espionage which refers to the large variety of below the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) activities in cyber \"grey zone,\" and also cyber-criminal activities, which does not trigger state responsibility in the strict and traditional sense, but may be changing in the cyber scenario.\nOn another note, this Article focuses on public attribution made by states. Entities other than states can also publicly attribute blame for a cyber operation, but for different aims and subject to different rules, if any. Private corporations, usually cyber security firms, may aim to enhance their influence, cultivate market demands, and ultimately cash out by selling products, services, and solutions on cybersecurity. Media may simply want an eye-catching story and may be easily manipulated by customized feeds of source information provided by enterprises or state organs. Since it falls outside of the purview of international law, the problem with these entities making public attribution merits a separate piece of analysis.\n Dong et al. (2014). Some commentator coined this as \"attribution by indictment,\" see Keitner (2019).\n The White House (2021).\n Among them are the EU, NATO, and UK. See, e.g., Council of the EU (2021, UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, National Cyber Security Centre, and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP (2021), NATO (2021).\n Brenner (2009).\n\nFor the latter part of the query, this article would propose that public attribution requires a timely calibration especially from the legal viewpoint. Otherwise, it may incur extra problem, as any accuser naturally tends to point fingers rather recklessly if no effective curb exists. To illustrate, Sect. 14.2 will usher in a widely used analytical framework to dissect cyber public attribution process, point out the ill-substantiation problem, and demonstrate its destabilizing nature. Section 14.3 will focus on three types of legal deficiencies in extant international law that enable and encourage ill-substantiated public attribution. Section 14.4 will then propose the norm on responsible public attribution as a possible way forward.\n## The Problem with Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\n## Three-Dimension Framework to Interrogate Public Attribution\nThe effort of cyber public attribution entails three generally recognized considerations, which stem from technical, political, and legal perspectives, respectively.\nFirst, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and restore the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is in large part a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber operation back to a machine or a location. Yet, pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires corroboration from human intelligence as well. It goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law.\nAlthough for tech experts like Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of a cyber security firm Crowdstrike, “identifying who is responsible … is now largely a solved problem,” states’ capabilities to associate an attack with a responsible party through technical means are far from evenly distributed. Asymmetric pattern of attribution practice can thus be deduced from such technical impurity, as the capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.\nSecond, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decision to\n For pioneering work to review the exercise of “matching an offender to an offence … in minimizing uncertainty” on tactical, operational, and strategical levels. See Rid and Buchanan (2015).\n Alperovitch (2018).\n The impurity of cyber capabilities among states, including that to attribute, has been assessed and largely validated by many empirical studies. For one example, see The International Institute for Strategic Studies (2021).\n For chart illustrations covering the period of 2015–2020 verifying this deduction, see Garrett Derian-Toth et al. (2021). Not surprisingly, top five countries that made the most use of public attributions are all from Five Eyes Alliance, and China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been identified as the responsible actors for 75% of all state-sponsored offensive cyber operations.\nmake, such as whether, when and in what form to publicly hold the actor accountable, or whether to call for coordinated actions from allies. As has been righteously noted, this political decision making is “a highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.” The accusing state may be influenced by a complex matrix of political intentions, including, inter alia: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms.\nCompatible with this complexity, different forms of public attributions have also been developed for different case scenarios. The US, for example, can make public cyber attribution by indicting foreign criminal, imposing economic sanctions, sending out technical alerts, and issuing official statements or press releases. To sum up, a state's decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.\nThird, from a legal perspective, public attribution means imputation by connecting the offense to an offender according to applicable rules, either domestic or international. For purpose of this chapter, domestic imputation—such as indictment against foreign individuals—is left undiscussed; specific focus is put on cases intending to establish state responsibility as per applicable international law. Within this limit, legal attribution also serves as a basis to legitimize future responding measures, such as self-defense or other forms of countermeasures the accusing state may take, depending on the nature and severity of the original malicious cyber operations. Ideally, the international legal system should provide clear guidance regarding rules for attribution. However, the current body of international law is seriously inadequate on this issue, which, as will be explained, is the very root of the problem.\nIt's worthy to note that states may still publicly accuse others of conducting unwanted cyber operations regardless of any clear legal basis for doing so. For example, the US officially holds that political attribution in the form of official announcements does not require meeting any legal standards in the strict sense. This well reflects the complexity embedded within public attribution practice as to its diversified form and purpose.\n\n## Substantiation as the Problem\nCompared to attribution that is confidentially processed and privately communicated, it is only logical that public attribution should be better supported. Conversely, however, public attribution is particularly susceptible to the problem of ill-substantiation, if not the absence of substantiation at all. The fundamental cause is that—to use the language of the three dimensions analytical framework—the political desire to publicly blame adversary state cannot be properly checked and balanced, due to technical impurity and the lack of legal restraints. Under strong political impetus to publicly blame the accused state, the technically capable state seems to enjoy taking advantage of the lawless status quo.\nThe term “ill-substantiated public attribution” is thereby specifically coined. It refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assigns responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. This problem lies in moving scale, rather than a simple yes-or-no judgment. As regards this concept, three illustrating points are necessary.\nFirst, the appropriate level of substantiation should match the purpose and form of public attribution. Take an extreme case as example. Here, a state is held publicly responsible for carrying out cyber operations that amount to an armed attack, activating the victim state’s right to self-defense. Obviously, such a claim is subject to challenge unless it can be unequivocally supported. Another comparable situation occurs when there is a breach of general international legal obligation of non-intervention, and the accusing state aims to establish responsibility that can justify its future countermeasures. The requirement to prove this latter claim should be appropriately downsized.\nSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among two opposite camps of states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated. The US and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can thereby “act reasonably under the circumstances.” The most updated result of such contention is reflected in the 2021 report of the UN GGE, when it emphasized again that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful\n Some have noted that different purposes of public attribution relate to different levels of evidence. See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, p 558.\n It is a long-debated question as to when does cyber operations fall within the meaning of “armed attack” in the language of Art. 51 of UN Charter. See, e.g., Dev (2015).\n Finlay and Payne (2019).\n China, Russia, et al. (2018).\n Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan (2017). Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\nacts brought against states should be substantiated.” The connotation that only verified accusation stands is clear, but the \"how\" question remains untouched.\nThird, ill-substantiated public attribution problem should be addressed in marginal sense rather than in average or absolute sense. Solid substantiation brings positive yield, which helps to produce long-term credibility and stability. But it also means cost. The author tends not to go extreme on the requirement of substantiation, paying no attention to the constraint condition of cost. Against this backdrop, the law of diminishing marginal utility instructs that the logical deduction to stop is the point where marginal cost for extra substantiation cannot be covered by the added yield it may bring. As per this logic, the most productive phase in terms of legalization is exactly when the world moves from the lawless status quo to a more disciplined and transparent regime of public attribution.\n### Destabilizing Nature of Reckless Accusation\nAlthough public attribution per se will not necessarily pose a problem, the ill-substantiated public attribution is unhelpful in securing the political pursuits of the accusing state, as has been previously listed.\nPublic attribution is often justified as a policy tool to ease domestic pressure to react against a foreign malicious cyber operation. By telling a falsified or incomplete story, an ill-substantiated—and thus unhealthy—public attribution tends to exaggerate the efficiency and the fierceness of the authority, but seldom with satisfying answer from those crucified. This may breed populism, which will in turn squeeze the policy space.\nCritiques on the credibleness of cyber deterrence often builds on the observation that cyber attribution is difficult and manageable from the side of a hidden attacker. Making ill-substantiated public attribution would only worsen this situation, because reckless accusation is insufficient to legitimize possible responding measures from the deterring state, and therefore is a cheap form of signaling in the eyes of a potential adversary. By the same token, naming and shaming are unlikely to work as previously anticipated by the accusing state, because reckless finger-pointing may be interpreted as slandering and defamation.\nIn some cases, a state pursues to exert more deterring influence by bringing its ally to form a collective attribution. To clarify, a mere increase in the number of the accusing side is probably useful in making a fuss, but it will not enhance the legitimacy of an attribution. For each claim to stand, the robustness of the legal logic and the completeness of the evidence still play a decisive role.\nIll-substantiated public attribution contributes little—if not brings outright detriment—to norm-building, as it relies on the incompleteness of applicable rules. When a state deems itself in an advantageous position in the game of accusing\n\n## Legal Deficiencies that Enable Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\nAs mentioned, international law serves as the basis to impute the accused state in relation to malicious cyber operations. State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law. Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution.\nThe deficiencies are threefold: (1) international rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios; (2) international legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular; and (3) legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attribution are not clearly defined.\n## Attribution Rules\nGeneral international law recognizes that attribution rules have been compiled in International Law Commission’s draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), particularly Articles 4 through 11. ARSIWA was adopted by the UN General Assembly, and is considered by both courts and commentators to be a fine codification of customary international law. Linking state organs’ activity to that state as per ARSIWA proves to be less troublesome. But when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors, to ascribe the agency to a state agent is no easy task. Unfortunately, most of the cyber attributions are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate\n Art. 2 of ARSIWA.\n (28 Jan 2002) General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, UN Doc (A/RES/56/83). https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/56/83.\n Crawford (2013).\nF. Yang\nactor's behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial. Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.\nRegarding the legal standard of the level of control required for attribution to occur, two generally recognized approaches[29] are the \"effective control\" test devised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,[30] and the \"overall control\" test developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Tadic decision.[31] Some argue that the \"overall control\" test should prevail in scenarios of cyber attribution, because the \"effective control\" test is far stricter and thus may function as \"a free pass to state sponsorship of cyberattacks.\"[32]\nThis proposal is far from a suitable solution for two reasons.[33] First, both of the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the nonstate actor, so that they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control. Second, the \"overall control\" standard was explicitly confined to \"organized and hierarchically structured groups\" such as military or paramilitary units,[34] while, as a matter of juridical fact, the stricter \"effective control\" test has been upheld in determining attribution concerning the acts of individuals or non-organized groups.\nConsidering how difficult it is to persuasively demonstrate that a state is effectively or generally controlling a nonstate entity, an alternative would be to hold states responsible for regulating or preventing unauthorized persons or groups from conducting malicious cyber operations within their jurisdictions. This potentially more qualified candidate of attribution rules is captured by the proposal to extend the application of \"due diligence\" in a cyber scenario. Due diligence is a notion first recognized by the ICJ in Corfu Channel.[35] Academic viewpoints among international lawyers are rather unanimous to import due diligence to cyber context, but are competing to categorize it as a primary rule of international obligation over state conduct,[36] or as a secondary rule to determine violation.[37]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare defines due diligence as a substantive obligation[38]; the United Nations Group of Government Experts (UN GEE) report endorses this approach with similar\n[29] Ibid, pp 146–154.\n[30] Case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA), Merits, (27 Jun 1986) ICJ Report.\n[31] Prosecutor v. Tadic, Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 Oct 1995) (ICTY-94-1-AR72).\n[32] Shackleford and Andres (2010).\n[33] Lahmann (2020).\n[34] Prosecutor v. Tadic, paras. 131, 137.\n[35] The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Merits, ICJ Report, 1949.\n[36] Shackelford et al. (2016), Jensen and Watts (2021).\n[37] Mackenzie and Scott (2021), Chircop (2018).\n[38] Schmitt (2017a), Rule 6. The rule reads: \"State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other states.\"\n\nwording. Per this understanding, the original task of attributing malicious cyber operations to a territorial state no longer requires an answer. A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, the following six commonly recognized elements should be fulfilled: (1) The existence of acts (by a nonstate actor or a third state) contrary to the rights of a victim state; (2) which are conducted from or through the territory of the potentially responsible state (or from or through the territory or cyber infrastructure under its control); (3) which would have been unlawful if conducted by the potentially responsible state; (4) which have serious adverse consequences for the victim state; (5) with respect to which the potentially responsible state has actual or constructive knowledge; and (6) upon which the potentially responsible state can act, but fails to take all feasible measures.\nAmong them, the third element on the unlawfulness test deserves a separate note, especially under the backdrop of a recently appeared expansionist view. According to such a view, territorial state is imputable for certain malicious cyber operations, even though they cannot unquestionably be categorized as internationally wrongful acts for lack of clear primary rules in international law. Combatting ransomware is one such example. Traditionally, ransomware attack is understood as cybercrime, attributable only to private bodies. As cybercrime can easily cross multiple borders, to effectively combat ransomware highly depends on international coordination of law enforcement, but the failure of which should not lead to liability of the territorial state.\nRecent development has overthrown this legal setting when, since the first half year of 2021, an intensive series of ransomware attacks hit the infrastructure and livelihood business worldwide and especially the US. In particular, President Biden publicly alleged that “Russia has some responsibility to deal with this.” After a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on June 16, 2021, he escalated that rhetoric: “Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory.” Some commentators have taken an even more proactive stance. They suggested that as a due diligence obligation, Russia is responsible to curb ransomware gangs in its territory, otherwise the US can legitimately adopt countermeasures including sanctions or military cyber operations. This signals a disturbing tendency to inappropriately broaden territorial state’s international obligation, for activities that happened inside its border that are harmful to another state, even when those activities would have not been unlawful if conducted by that territorial state.\n The Group of Governmental Experts, Report on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n See CCDCOE Cyberlaw Wiki, Due diligence. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Due_diligence.\n Remarks by President Biden on the Economy (2021).\n Remarks by President Biden in Press Conference (2021).\n Harding et al. (2021); Goldsmith (2021). Note there are also other viewpoints justifying the US combating ransomware group in Russian territory as “self-help,” instead of as countermeasure as to Russia’s breach of due diligence obligation. See Corn (2021).\nF. Yang\nTurning to the minority approach of due diligence as an attribution rule, the identification of the actual author shifts to that of state territory where those operations originate. According to such “indirect” or “imputed” attribution,[44] a state is held responsible for the cyber malicious operations harming another state rather than for a breach of its due diligence obligation, provided that the act was launched from computer systems located on its territory, and it failed to take feasible measures against the act. As this unorthodox approach seems a bit excessive, it is no wonder the UN GGE specifically pointed out that “the indication that an ICT [information and communications technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from a state’s territory or from its ICT infrastructure may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.”[45]\nIn light of these contending and confusing viewpoints, misusing and abusing “due diligence” to forge a legal logic to back up public attribution claims could facilitate ill-substantiation. It is thus important to reiterate the following points. First, “due diligence,” if imported to the cyber scenario, should be better understood as setting an obligation for a state rather than serving as a way to attribute. Second, the actual occurrence of a harmful cyber incident, which would have been unlawful if conducted by a potentially responsible state, is a prerequisite for the injured state to claim a due diligence violation. Third, even if state responsibility is successfully established along the legal path of due diligence, the responding measures that the accusing state might legitimately take should proportionately reflect the fact that the accused state did not conduct the malicious activities but, less harmfully, failed to address them with all feasible measures.\n## Evidentiary Requirements[46]\nGeneral international law has not yet developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence. Key evidentiary issues such as burden and standard of proof are normally evaluated on an ad hoc basis. For cyber disputes, such ambiguity can be interpreted as a loophole that allows states to carry out malicious cyber operations hoping for no consequence; or it can also be interpreted as an opportunity that allows states to sometimes make public attributions “reasonably under the circumstances,”[47] sometimes rather recklessly.\n[44] Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, p 91.\n[45] Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n[46] Some commentator deems the evidentiary requirement in legal argument on cyber issues as a deadlock problem, which has no solution, so long as one sticks to an interventionist approach to impose international law on cyber operations. See d'Aspremont (2016).\n[47] Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan BJ, op. cit. 22, p 177. Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\n\nOf those two evidentiary issues, burden of proof is less controversial. It is generally recognized that in \"a bilateral dispute over state responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant state.\"48 As a mechanism specifically tailored for cyber attribution, some proposed a shift of the burden of proof scheme, referred to as a \"virtual control\" test.49 The main argument behind this idea is that in cyber disputes, the territorial state for the alleged misbehavior has better access to the knowledge necessary to verify certain facts. By this mechanism, a prima facie responsibility would be established for the territorial state, unless it can provide evidence showing otherwise. It is not hard to imagine that this would probably cause more trouble than it intends to solve.50\nRegarding the standard of proof, a generally observed practice is that evidentiary standards should vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. Established ICJ cases also emphasized the importance to keep standard of proof transparent in the judgments.[51] Through a comparative assessment of international litigation, one can identify a few recognizable levels of hierarchy on standards of proof, largely borrowed from the domestic legal system of common law countries.[52]\nAs the highest level of requirement of standard of proof, \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" has its root in criminal cases and embodies the value of presumption of innocence. It requires a full chain of evidence, weighing together heavily toward one direction that forms a virtually indisputable claim. In international juridical forum, such standard is usually mandatory to substantiate a guilty verdict, as is made clear in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court regarding international criminal liability.[53] The ICJ held in a few of its cases that, \"claims against a state involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive...same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\"[54] Because a cyberattack amounts to an international crime with exceptional gravity, to substantiate its attribution should meet \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement.\nIn some cases, a preponderance of evidence is sufficient to support a legal claim. This lower level of requirement for the standard of proof concerns mainly the balance of probabilities of the two sides, which will favor the party with a more likely than not argument. In this regard, judges have vast discretionary power. As a result, extant\n\nF. Yang\ncases that adopt \"preponderance standard\" exclusively address territory issues, which rarely involve state responsibility.\nWith some room for debate, the ICJ cases and state practices support the “clear and convincing” standard for cases on use of force. This requirement for the standard of proof lies in between preponderance and beyond-reasonable-doubt standard. As self-defense is a legitimate exception against prohibition of using force, to substantiate a self-defense case—in normal or cyber scenario—should also adopt the “clear and convincing” standard. In other regular cases, the amount of certainty the ICJ generally requires seems also to be clear and convincing evidence by parties. To prove a cyber attribution regarding use of force, the “clear and convincing” standard is applicable, since “reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.”\nTo sum up, the international legal practice, mainly reflected by the ICJ’s case law, so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation. Based on this premise, the adequate default level of evidence for cyber public attribution should better be set around “clear and convincing” standard, with a sliding scale from “preponderance evidence” up to “proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Exactly which standard prevails should match the severity of the claim on a case-by-case basis. One potential choice is to argue that cyber attribution for self-defense requires “clear and convincing” standard, while, for lower countermeasure level, the preponderance standard would suffice. However, this should not become a strict legal test, due to the complexity of real-life cases.\nApart from the complex standard of proof debate, a safer bottom line for the evidentiary requirement could be drawn from general principle of procedural law: in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking. Especially in cyber attribution cases, this can be a proper guideline to counterbalance a convenient excuse of the accusing state to justify its selective disclosure of limited material in the name of prevention of divulging intelligence secrets. It is an important mechanism to bolster an attribution’s credibility by providing sufficient evidence to allow the accused state and other potential stakeholders to confirm or debunk.\n The Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Saldavor/Honduras), ICJ Judgment of 11 September 1992, para. 248; Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Pateh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore), ICJ Judgment of 23 May 2008, para. 86.\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Uganda), ICJ Judgment of 2005, ICJ Reports (2005), paras. 72, 91, 136.\n O’Connell (2002); Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 559–562.\n Teitelbaum (2007).\n See Schmitt (2011).\n Brunner et al. (2019).\n Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 576–586.\n Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 28.\n\nSome may disfavor the above discussion on setting an evidentiary standard. They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, while most cyber public attribution cases will not ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and nature of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, “Even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.”[63] In the sense of facilitating customary law on evidentiary requirement, the formation of opinio juris may take some time, but it will never happen if the world is stuck to its current awkward status. The necessity and urgency are especially true for supporters of the “instant” international customary law.[64]\nAnother opposing viewpoint is that it is hard to reconcile the evidentiary requirement on cyber attribution on one hand with the necessity to make a timely attribution on the other.[65] This dilemma indeed exists. It should be subject to careful evaluation in a context-specific approach. Again, challenges in collecting and exhibiting evidence should not excuse evidence-less accusations.\n## Erroneous Attribution\nIf a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous—or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations—what legal consequences would the accusing state face? Underdevelopment of this legal issue will provide extra room for ill-substantiated public attribution, because no foreseeable punishment exists for irresponsible or erroneous allegations. However, current international law on this issue is tricky,[66] not to mention that technical hurdles against a confident attribution in cyber brings extra complexity to this problem.\nTo begin with, it is safe to infer that, once the attribution proves to be based on false facts, the international wrongfulness of the subsequent self-defense or countermeasure adopted by the accusing state cannot be unquestionably eliminated. In other words, the accusing state may be held responsible for taking unjustified steps against the accused state. As a counterargument, the accusing state may propose that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith. Could claims of “reasonableness” and “honesty” exonerate its false judgment?\n[63] Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 571–572.\n[64] Bin Cheng first put forward the notion of \"instant\" international customary law in a discussion on outer space law. See Bin Cheng, United Nations Resolutions on Outer Space: ‘Instant’ International Customary Law? In: Bin Cheng (1997).\n[65] Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 32.\n[66] Milanovic (2020).\nF. Yang\nPositive view is echoed by some scholarly papers$^{67}$ as well as official statements.$^{68}$ For example, Tallinn Manuel 2.0 explicitly asserts:\nthe exercise of the right of self-defense... is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made *ex ante*, not *ex post facto*. Their reasonableness will be assessed based upon the information available at the time they were made, not in light of information that subsequently becomes available.$^{69}$\nOther commentators opine that with good faith or not, wrongful attribution in the first place will nonetheless make subsequent measures the fruit of a poisonous tree. The ILC holds such view in its commentary to Article 49(1) of ARSIWA.$^{70}$ If, during an *ex post* examination, the attribution tends to be wrongful because of errors in *ex ante* factual assessment, the mistaken state may be responsible whether its agents had acted in good faith or not.$^{71}$\nLast but not least, what if the accusing state makes a public attribution that later proves wrong, but it does not take, concrete measures? Although the accused state does not suffer from the responding measures, but the harm to its fame and reputation has been inflicted. Under such circumstances, should the accusing state be held partially responsible for the false attribution, sometimes intentionally? Would belittlement of this question encourage even more ill-substantiated public attribution? This issue deserves more international discussion.\n## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution\nAgainst the challenges posed by ill-substantiated public attribution, tentative solutions should be sought as per the three dimensions analytical framework, with due consideration paid to technical, political, and legal dimensions, respectively. Contrary proposals have been made to establish a centralized international attribution mechanism,$^{72}$ and to keep the current system of decentralized public–private attributions working.$^{73}$ As this paper particularly takes the perspective of legal lens, an international norm on responsible state’s behavior in public attribution is thus proposed as a possible way forward.\nIn this regard, UN GGE has provided a sound basis by repeatedly emphasizing in its final reports that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts\n$^{67}$ Sklerov (2009).\n$^{68}$ The White House (2012).\n$^{69}$ Schmitt (2017b).\n$^{70}$ ARSIWA, Commentaries, art. 49(3).\n$^{71}$ Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 97–109.\n$^{72}$ Shany and Schmitt (2020).\n$^{73}$ Eichensehr (2019).\nbrought against states should be substantiated.” Righteous in its nature though, this norm only points out the need for accusations to be substantiated but fails to elaborate how. Vis-à-vis the legal deficiencies previously identified, and bearing in mind the law of diminishing marginal utility, a norm on responsible public attribution should embody the following points.\n### Starting with an Out-of-The-Box Thought\nPrivate consultation before making cyber attribution public does not involve an ill-substantiation problem, as it will be confined in a confidential environment. If this becomes a mandatory preliminary step, improvement could be expected, because such procedural mechanism has proved to be useful in cutting down interstate disputes in other fields of international law. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a noticeable example. According to the relevant WTO rules, disputes are initiated through a formal request for consultations, whereby the complaining member invites the member whose measures are being challenged to discuss the disputed matter in order to resolve it without recourse to further litigation. Such consultation is mandatory, confidential, and with a time limit. If a similar mechanism exists in cyber conflict, the accusing state has a great chance to first consult privately with the accused state, channeling its interest demands without forcing the latter into an awkward position.\n### On Attribution Criteria\nState should refrain from removing key elements from due diligence rule to expand the coverage of another state's responsibility scope. Against the urgent need to cope with seriously damaging cybercrimes as ransomware, it may be too rash to argue straightforward for the existence of due diligence obligation to counter, in spite of no primary rule on such behavior. To better balance the position of the disputing states, and to better meet the challenge from ransomware and the like, it may be desirable to envisage a burden to investigate assumed by the accused state, provided that the accusing state can support its claim with satisfied evidence.\nOn Evidentiary Requirement\nThe standards of proof should be set in principle by the “clear and convincing” test, and shall increase as the seriousness of the accusation enhances. It is recommended that private channels be used to demonstrate early evidence. In this way, the accusing state is able to send a credible signal about its awareness and knowledge of the malicious operation, while the accused state has enough policy space—and face—to maneuver.\n### On Legal Consequence\nIt should be clear that the international wrongfulness of the responding measures taken by the accusing state cannot be justified by attribution wrongfully made on the basis of error in factual assessment. More ideally, states should act with good faith not making unsolidified accusations.\nA combined norm on attribution rule, evidentiary requirement, and legal consequence of erroneous attribution could be termed as. (1) A state cannot be held internationally legally responsible solely for an ICT activity launched or otherwise originates from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. (2) A state should substantiate its public attribution with adequate level evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a “clear and convincing” case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. (3) A state should refrain from taking responding measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making erroneous or falsified attribution.\n## Conclusion\nStrictly, the attribution under international law is but one of the two indispensable components in determining internationally wrongful acts, the other being the breach of an international obligation. A thorough discussion of attribution cannot do without addressing primary rules on cyber operations, either. This has been shown in previous analysis regarding due diligence. But still, the attribution discussion bears meaning, especially when it relates to some important legal deficiencies.\nRecent development is featured by the states beginning to favor public attribution as a policy tool. France consistently holds a cautious attitude toward public attribution, when it views naming an enemy, especially if it is a sovereign state, as a political act that requires highest level of decision. When France officially\n\nattributed a cyberattack for the first time, $^{78}$  in July 2021, it represents \"a subtle shift in the implementation of its attribution strategy.\" $^{79}$  China, the most frequent receiver of cyber public attributions, also made its first practice in 2021 through a private cyber security firm, claiming Indian source malicious cyber operations have been trying to infiltrate into sensitive zones within China's cyber domain. $^{80}$\nAgainst this backdrop, the expected marginal benefit from substantiated claims would greatly outweigh the marginal cost to substantiate the claim according to a set of commonly acceptable codes of conduct. A norm on responsible public attribution may be just on time to save the world from a chaotic blame game.\nAcknowledgements The author would extend the deepest appreciation to George Perkovich, Ariel Levite, Jon Bateman, Scott Collard, June Lee from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to Chuanying Lu, Manshu Xu from Shanghai Institute for International Studies, and to Yan Li from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, for their insightful critiques on earlier drafts of this Article.",

Yang\n# Introduction\nThe history for states to publicly attribute malicious cyber operations to an alleged accused is not long. Although being the most frequent user of such policy tool, the US government's debut only came in 2014, when five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were indicted in a district court in the US, for hacking American companies for intellectual property. A more prominent example is the denunciation made by the Biden Administration in 2021, also echoed by some of its allies, over China's Ministry of State Security for maintaining a network of criminal contract hackers responsible for the Microsoft Exchange Server attack that affected large group of worldwide users.\nNo wonder, after a state—either its governmental system or private businesses therein—suffers from malicious cyber operations by a foreign actor, it is tempting to identify and hold publicly accountable whoever it believes is responsible for that misbehavior. With an intention to deter malice and encourage order, such self-help effort can seemingly be of value to an underregulated cyberspace.\nWhen cyberspace just began to show its impact on international affairs, it was once a common fear that, with its unique architecture and operational process, \"the Internet is perfect for plausible deniability.\" The recent tide of public attribution—especially ill-substantiated ones among them—is no panacea against such fear, but rather seems to be a hypercorrection. For the international society, neither direction is satisfactory. The ultimate question to ask should then be: how to strike a balance between these conflicting interests, so that the bad agents in cyberspace cannot easily escape from penalty, while reckless public accusation also comes with a nonnegligible consequence.\n To clarify, this Article uses the term \"cyber operation\" to incorporate different categories of cyber activities, including cyberattack which may amount to a use of force or armed attack in the sense of international law, and cyber espionage which refers to the large variety of below the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) activities in cyber \"grey zone,\" and also cyber-criminal activities, which does not trigger state responsibility in the strict and traditional sense, but may be changing in the cyber scenario.\nOn another note, this Article focuses on public attribution made by states. Entities other than states can also publicly attribute blame for a cyber operation, but for different aims and subject to different rules, if any. Private corporations, usually cyber security firms, may aim to enhance their influence, cultivate market demands, and ultimately cash out by selling products, services, and solutions on cybersecurity. Media may simply want an eye-catching story and may be easily manipulated by customized feeds of source information provided by enterprises or state organs. Since it falls outside of the purview of international law, the problem with these entities making public attribution merits a separate piece of analysis.\n Dong et al. (2014). Some commentator coined this as \"attribution by indictment,\" see Keitner (2019).\n The White House (2021).\n Among them are the EU, NATO, and UK. See, e.g., Council of the EU (2021, UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, National Cyber Security Centre, and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP (2021), NATO (2021).\n Brenner (2009).\n\nFor the latter part of the query, this article would propose that public attribution requires a timely calibration especially from the legal viewpoint. Otherwise, it may incur extra problem, as any accuser naturally tends to point fingers rather recklessly if no effective curb exists. To illustrate, Sect. 14.2 will usher in a widely used analytical framework to dissect cyber public attribution process, point out the ill-substantiation problem, and demonstrate its destabilizing nature. Section 14.3 will focus on three types of legal deficiencies in extant international law that enable and encourage ill-substantiated public attribution. Section 14.4 will then propose the norm on responsible public attribution as a possible way forward.\n## The Problem with Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\n## Three-Dimension Framework to Interrogate Public Attribution\nThe effort of cyber public attribution entails three generally recognized considerations, which stem from technical, political, and legal perspectives, respectively.\nFirst, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and restore the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is in large part a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber operation back to a machine or a location. Yet, pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires corroboration from human intelligence as well. It goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law.\nAlthough for tech experts like Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of a cyber security firm Crowdstrike, “identifying who is responsible … is now largely a solved problem,” states’ capabilities to associate an attack with a responsible party through technical means are far from evenly distributed. Asymmetric pattern of attribution practice can thus be deduced from such technical impurity, as the capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.\nSecond, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decision to\n For pioneering work to review the exercise of “matching an offender to an offence … in minimizing uncertainty” on tactical, operational, and strategical levels. See Rid and Buchanan (2015).\n Alperovitch (2018).\n The impurity of cyber capabilities among states, including that to attribute, has been assessed and largely validated by many empirical studies. For one example, see The International Institute for Strategic Studies (2021).\n For chart illustrations covering the period of 2015–2020 verifying this deduction, see Garrett Derian-Toth et al. (2021). Not surprisingly, top five countries that made the most use of public attributions are all from Five Eyes Alliance, and China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been identified as the responsible actors for 75% of all state-sponsored offensive cyber operations.\nmake, such as whether, when and in what form to publicly hold the actor accountable, or whether to call for coordinated actions from allies. As has been righteously noted, this political decision making is “a highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.” The accusing state may be influenced by a complex matrix of political intentions, including, inter alia: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms.\nCompatible with this complexity, different forms of public attributions have also been developed for different case scenarios. The US, for example, can make public cyber attribution by indicting foreign criminal, imposing economic sanctions, sending out technical alerts, and issuing official statements or press releases. To sum up, a state's decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.\nThird, from a legal perspective, public attribution means imputation by connecting the offense to an offender according to applicable rules, either domestic or international. For purpose of this chapter, domestic imputation—such as indictment against foreign individuals—is left undiscussed; specific focus is put on cases intending to establish state responsibility as per applicable international law. Within this limit, legal attribution also serves as a basis to legitimize future responding measures, such as self-defense or other forms of countermeasures the accusing state may take, depending on the nature and severity of the original malicious cyber operations. Ideally, the international legal system should provide clear guidance regarding rules for attribution. However, the current body of international law is seriously inadequate on this issue, which, as will be explained, is the very root of the problem.\nIt's worthy to note that states may still publicly accuse others of conducting unwanted cyber operations regardless of any clear legal basis for doing so. For example, the US officially holds that political attribution in the form of official announcements does not require meeting any legal standards in the strict sense. This well reflects the complexity embedded within public attribution practice as to its diversified form and purpose.\n\n## Substantiation as the Problem\nCompared to attribution that is confidentially processed and privately communicated, it is only logical that public attribution should be better supported. Conversely, however, public attribution is particularly susceptible to the problem of ill-substantiation, if not the absence of substantiation at all. The fundamental cause is that—to use the language of the three dimensions analytical framework—the political desire to publicly blame adversary state cannot be properly checked and balanced, due to technical impurity and the lack of legal restraints. Under strong political impetus to publicly blame the accused state, the technically capable state seems to enjoy taking advantage of the lawless status quo.\nThe term “ill-substantiated public attribution” is thereby specifically coined. It refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assigns responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. This problem lies in moving scale, rather than a simple yes-or-no judgment. As regards this concept, three illustrating points are necessary.\nFirst, the appropriate level of substantiation should match the purpose and form of public attribution. Take an extreme case as example. Here, a state is held publicly responsible for carrying out cyber operations that amount to an armed attack, activating the victim state’s right to self-defense. Obviously, such a claim is subject to challenge unless it can be unequivocally supported. Another comparable situation occurs when there is a breach of general international legal obligation of non-intervention, and the accusing state aims to establish responsibility that can justify its future countermeasures. The requirement to prove this latter claim should be appropriately downsized.\nSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among two opposite camps of states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated. The US and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can thereby “act reasonably under the circumstances.” The most updated result of such contention is reflected in the 2021 report of the UN GGE, when it emphasized again that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful\n Some have noted that different purposes of public attribution relate to different levels of evidence. See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, p 558.\n It is a long-debated question as to when does cyber operations fall within the meaning of “armed attack” in the language of Art. 51 of UN Charter. See, e.g., Dev (2015).\n Finlay and Payne (2019).\n China, Russia, et al. (2018).\n Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan (2017). Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\nacts brought against states should be substantiated.” The connotation that only verified accusation stands is clear, but the \"how\" question remains untouched.\nThird, ill-substantiated public attribution problem should be addressed in marginal sense rather than in average or absolute sense. Solid substantiation brings positive yield, which helps to produce long-term credibility and stability. But it also means cost. The author tends not to go extreme on the requirement of substantiation, paying no attention to the constraint condition of cost. Against this backdrop, the law of diminishing marginal utility instructs that the logical deduction to stop is the point where marginal cost for extra substantiation cannot be covered by the added yield it may bring. As per this logic, the most productive phase in terms of legalization is exactly when the world moves from the lawless status quo to a more disciplined and transparent regime of public attribution.\n### Destabilizing Nature of Reckless Accusation\nAlthough public attribution per se will not necessarily pose a problem, the ill-substantiated public attribution is unhelpful in securing the political pursuits of the accusing state, as has been previously listed.\nPublic attribution is often justified as a policy tool to ease domestic pressure to react against a foreign malicious cyber operation. By telling a falsified or incomplete story, an ill-substantiated—and thus unhealthy—public attribution tends to exaggerate the efficiency and the fierceness of the authority, but seldom with satisfying answer from those crucified. This may breed populism, which will in turn squeeze the policy space.\nCritiques on the credibleness of cyber deterrence often builds on the observation that cyber attribution is difficult and manageable from the side of a hidden attacker. Making ill-substantiated public attribution would only worsen this situation, because reckless accusation is insufficient to legitimize possible responding measures from the deterring state, and therefore is a cheap form of signaling in the eyes of a potential adversary. By the same token, naming and shaming are unlikely to work as previously anticipated by the accusing state, because reckless finger-pointing may be interpreted as slandering and defamation.\nIn some cases, a state pursues to exert more deterring influence by bringing its ally to form a collective attribution. To clarify, a mere increase in the number of the accusing side is probably useful in making a fuss, but it will not enhance the legitimacy of an attribution. For each claim to stand, the robustness of the legal logic and the completeness of the evidence still play a decisive role.\nIll-substantiated public attribution contributes little—if not brings outright detriment—to norm-building, as it relies on the incompleteness of applicable rules. When a state deems itself in an advantageous position in the game of accusing\n\n## Legal Deficiencies that Enable Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\nAs mentioned, international law serves as the basis to impute the accused state in relation to malicious cyber operations. State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law. Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution.\nThe deficiencies are threefold: (1) international rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios; (2) international legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular; and (3) legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attribution are not clearly defined.\n## Attribution Rules\nGeneral international law recognizes that attribution rules have been compiled in International Law Commission’s draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), particularly Articles 4 through 11. ARSIWA was adopted by the UN General Assembly, and is considered by both courts and commentators to be a fine codification of customary international law. Linking state organs’ activity to that state as per ARSIWA proves to be less troublesome. But when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors, to ascribe the agency to a state agent is no easy task. Unfortunately, most of the cyber attributions are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate\n Art. 2 of ARSIWA.\n (28 Jan 2002) General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, UN Doc (A/RES/56/83). https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/56/83.\n Crawford (2013).\nF. Yang\nactor's behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial. Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.\nRegarding the legal standard of the level of control required for attribution to occur, two generally recognized approaches[29] are the \"effective control\" test devised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,[30] and the \"overall control\" test developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Tadic decision.[31] Some argue that the \"overall control\" test should prevail in scenarios of cyber attribution, because the \"effective control\" test is far stricter and thus may function as \"a free pass to state sponsorship of cyberattacks.\"[32]\nThis proposal is far from a suitable solution for two reasons.[33] First, both of the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the nonstate actor, so that they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control. Second, the \"overall control\" standard was explicitly confined to \"organized and hierarchically structured groups\" such as military or paramilitary units,[34] while, as a matter of juridical fact, the stricter \"effective control\" test has been upheld in determining attribution concerning the acts of individuals or non-organized groups.\nConsidering how difficult it is to persuasively demonstrate that a state is effectively or generally controlling a nonstate entity, an alternative would be to hold states responsible for regulating or preventing unauthorized persons or groups from conducting malicious cyber operations within their jurisdictions. This potentially more qualified candidate of attribution rules is captured by the proposal to extend the application of \"due diligence\" in a cyber scenario. Due diligence is a notion first recognized by the ICJ in Corfu Channel.[35] Academic viewpoints among international lawyers are rather unanimous to import due diligence to cyber context, but are competing to categorize it as a primary rule of international obligation over state conduct,[36] or as a secondary rule to determine violation.[37]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare defines due diligence as a substantive obligation[38]; the United Nations Group of Government Experts (UN GEE) report endorses this approach with similar\n[29] Ibid, pp 146–154.\n[30] Case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA), Merits, (27 Jun 1986) ICJ Report.\n[31] Prosecutor v. Tadic, Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 Oct 1995) (ICTY-94-1-AR72).\n[32] Shackleford and Andres (2010).\n[33] Lahmann (2020).\n[34] Prosecutor v. Tadic, paras. 131, 137.\n[35] The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Merits, ICJ Report, 1949.\n[36] Shackelford et al. (2016), Jensen and Watts (2021).\n[37] Mackenzie and Scott (2021), Chircop (2018).\n[38] Schmitt (2017a), Rule 6. The rule reads: \"State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other states.\"\n\nwording. Per this understanding, the original task of attributing malicious cyber operations to a territorial state no longer requires an answer. A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, the following six commonly recognized elements should be fulfilled: (1) The existence of acts (by a nonstate actor or a third state) contrary to the rights of a victim state; (2) which are conducted from or through the territory of the potentially responsible state (or from or through the territory or cyber infrastructure under its control); (3) which would have been unlawful if conducted by the potentially responsible state; (4) which have serious adverse consequences for the victim state; (5) with respect to which the potentially responsible state has actual or constructive knowledge; and (6) upon which the potentially responsible state can act, but fails to take all feasible measures.\nAmong them, the third element on the unlawfulness test deserves a separate note, especially under the backdrop of a recently appeared expansionist view. According to such a view, territorial state is imputable for certain malicious cyber operations, even though they cannot unquestionably be categorized as internationally wrongful acts for lack of clear primary rules in international law. Combatting ransomware is one such example. Traditionally, ransomware attack is understood as cybercrime, attributable only to private bodies. As cybercrime can easily cross multiple borders, to effectively combat ransomware highly depends on international coordination of law enforcement, but the failure of which should not lead to liability of the territorial state.\nRecent development has overthrown this legal setting when, since the first half year of 2021, an intensive series of ransomware attacks hit the infrastructure and livelihood business worldwide and especially the US. In particular, President Biden publicly alleged that “Russia has some responsibility to deal with this.” After a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on June 16, 2021, he escalated that rhetoric: “Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory.” Some commentators have taken an even more proactive stance. They suggested that as a due diligence obligation, Russia is responsible to curb ransomware gangs in its territory, otherwise the US can legitimately adopt countermeasures including sanctions or military cyber operations. This signals a disturbing tendency to inappropriately broaden territorial state’s international obligation, for activities that happened inside its border that are harmful to another state, even when those activities would have not been unlawful if conducted by that territorial state.\n The Group of Governmental Experts, Report on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n See CCDCOE Cyberlaw Wiki, Due diligence. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Due_diligence.\n Remarks by President Biden on the Economy (2021).\n Remarks by President Biden in Press Conference (2021).\n Harding et al. (2021); Goldsmith (2021). Note there are also other viewpoints justifying the US combating ransomware group in Russian territory as “self-help,” instead of as countermeasure as to Russia’s breach of due diligence obligation. See Corn (2021).\nF. Yang\nTurning to the minority approach of due diligence as an attribution rule, the identification of the actual author shifts to that of state territory where those operations originate. According to such “indirect” or “imputed” attribution,[44] a state is held responsible for the cyber malicious operations harming another state rather than for a breach of its due diligence obligation, provided that the act was launched from computer systems located on its territory, and it failed to take feasible measures against the act. As this unorthodox approach seems a bit excessive, it is no wonder the UN GGE specifically pointed out that “the indication that an ICT [information and communications technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from a state’s territory or from its ICT infrastructure may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.”[45]\nIn light of these contending and confusing viewpoints, misusing and abusing “due diligence” to forge a legal logic to back up public attribution claims could facilitate ill-substantiation. It is thus important to reiterate the following points. First, “due diligence,” if imported to the cyber scenario, should be better understood as setting an obligation for a state rather than serving as a way to attribute. Second, the actual occurrence of a harmful cyber incident, which would have been unlawful if conducted by a potentially responsible state, is a prerequisite for the injured state to claim a due diligence violation. Third, even if state responsibility is successfully established along the legal path of due diligence, the responding measures that the accusing state might legitimately take should proportionately reflect the fact that the accused state did not conduct the malicious activities but, less harmfully, failed to address them with all feasible measures.\n## Evidentiary Requirements[46]\nGeneral international law has not yet developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence. Key evidentiary issues such as burden and standard of proof are normally evaluated on an ad hoc basis. For cyber disputes, such ambiguity can be interpreted as a loophole that allows states to carry out malicious cyber operations hoping for no consequence; or it can also be interpreted as an opportunity that allows states to sometimes make public attributions “reasonably under the circumstances,”[47] sometimes rather recklessly.\n[44] Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, p 91.\n[45] Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n[46] Some commentator deems the evidentiary requirement in legal argument on cyber issues as a deadlock problem, which has no solution, so long as one sticks to an interventionist approach to impose international law on cyber operations. See d'Aspremont (2016).\n[47] Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan BJ, op. cit. 22, p 177. Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\n\nOf those two evidentiary issues, burden of proof is less controversial. It is generally recognized that in \"a bilateral dispute over state responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant state.\"48 As a mechanism specifically tailored for cyber attribution, some proposed a shift of the burden of proof scheme, referred to as a \"virtual control\" test.49 The main argument behind this idea is that in cyber disputes, the territorial state for the alleged misbehavior has better access to the knowledge necessary to verify certain facts. By this mechanism, a prima facie responsibility would be established for the territorial state, unless it can provide evidence showing otherwise. It is not hard to imagine that this would probably cause more trouble than it intends to solve.50\nRegarding the standard of proof, a generally observed practice is that evidentiary standards should vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. Established ICJ cases also emphasized the importance to keep standard of proof transparent in the judgments.[51] Through a comparative assessment of international litigation, one can identify a few recognizable levels of hierarchy on standards of proof, largely borrowed from the domestic legal system of common law countries.[52]\nAs the highest level of requirement of standard of proof, \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" has its root in criminal cases and embodies the value of presumption of innocence. It requires a full chain of evidence, weighing together heavily toward one direction that forms a virtually indisputable claim. In international juridical forum, such standard is usually mandatory to substantiate a guilty verdict, as is made clear in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court regarding international criminal liability.[53] The ICJ held in a few of its cases that, \"claims against a state involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive...same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\"[54] Because a cyberattack amounts to an international crime with exceptional gravity, to substantiate its attribution should meet \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement.\nIn some cases, a preponderance of evidence is sufficient to support a legal claim. This lower level of requirement for the standard of proof concerns mainly the balance of probabilities of the two sides, which will favor the party with a more likely than not argument. In this regard, judges have vast discretionary power. As a result, extant\n\nF. Yang\ncases that adopt \"preponderance standard\" exclusively address territory issues, which rarely involve state responsibility.\nWith some room for debate, the ICJ cases and state practices support the “clear and convincing” standard for cases on use of force. This requirement for the standard of proof lies in between preponderance and beyond-reasonable-doubt standard. As self-defense is a legitimate exception against prohibition of using force, to substantiate a self-defense case—in normal or cyber scenario—should also adopt the “clear and convincing” standard. In other regular cases, the amount of certainty the ICJ generally requires seems also to be clear and convincing evidence by parties. To prove a cyber attribution regarding use of force, the “clear and convincing” standard is applicable, since “reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.”\nTo sum up, the international legal practice, mainly reflected by the ICJ’s case law, so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation. Based on this premise, the adequate default level of evidence for cyber public attribution should better be set around “clear and convincing” standard, with a sliding scale from “preponderance evidence” up to “proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Exactly which standard prevails should match the severity of the claim on a case-by-case basis. One potential choice is to argue that cyber attribution for self-defense requires “clear and convincing” standard, while, for lower countermeasure level, the preponderance standard would suffice. However, this should not become a strict legal test, due to the complexity of real-life cases.\nApart from the complex standard of proof debate, a safer bottom line for the evidentiary requirement could be drawn from general principle of procedural law: in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking. Especially in cyber attribution cases, this can be a proper guideline to counterbalance a convenient excuse of the accusing state to justify its selective disclosure of limited material in the name of prevention of divulging intelligence secrets. It is an important mechanism to bolster an attribution’s credibility by providing sufficient evidence to allow the accused state and other potential stakeholders to confirm or debunk.\n The Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Saldavor/Honduras), ICJ Judgment of 11 September 1992, para. 248; Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Pateh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore), ICJ Judgment of 23 May 2008, para. 86.\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, while most cyber public attribution cases will not ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and nature of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, “Even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.”[63] In the sense of facilitating customary law on evidentiary requirement, the formation of opinio juris may take some time, but it will never happen if the world is stuck to its current awkward status. The necessity and urgency are especially true for supporters of the “instant” international customary law.[64]\nAnother opposing viewpoint is that it is hard to reconcile the evidentiary requirement on cyber attribution on one hand with the necessity to make a timely attribution on the other.[65] This dilemma indeed exists. It should be subject to careful evaluation in a context-specific approach. Again, challenges in collecting and exhibiting evidence should not excuse evidence-less accusations.\n## Erroneous Attribution\nIf a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous—or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations—what legal consequences would the accusing state face? Underdevelopment of this legal issue will provide extra room for ill-substantiated public attribution, because no foreseeable punishment exists for irresponsible or erroneous allegations. However, current international law on this issue is tricky,[66] not to mention that technical hurdles against a confident attribution in cyber brings extra complexity to this problem.\nTo begin with, it is safe to infer that, once the attribution proves to be based on false facts, the international wrongfulness of the subsequent self-defense or countermeasure adopted by the accusing state cannot be unquestionably eliminated. In other words, the accusing state may be held responsible for taking unjustified steps against the accused state. As a counterargument, the accusing state may propose that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith. Could claims of “reasonableness” and “honesty” exonerate its false judgment?\n[63] Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 571–572.\n[64] Bin Cheng first put forward the notion of \"instant\" international customary law in a discussion on outer space law. See Bin Cheng, United Nations Resolutions on Outer Space: ‘Instant’ International Customary Law? In: Bin Cheng (1997).\n[65] Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 32.\n[66] Milanovic (2020).\nF. Yang\nPositive view is echoed by some scholarly papers$^{67}$ as well as official statements.$^{68}$ For example, Tallinn Manuel 2.0 explicitly asserts:\nthe exercise of the right of self-defense... is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made *ex ante*, not *ex post facto*. Their reasonableness will be assessed based upon the information available at the time they were made, not in light of information that subsequently becomes available.$^{69}$\nOther commentators opine that with good faith or not, wrongful attribution in the first place will nonetheless make subsequent measures the fruit of a poisonous tree. The ILC holds such view in its commentary to Article 49(1) of ARSIWA.$^{70}$ If, during an *ex post* examination, the attribution tends to be wrongful because of errors in *ex ante* factual assessment, the mistaken state may be responsible whether its agents had acted in good faith or not.$^{71}$\nLast but not least, what if the accusing state makes a public attribution that later proves wrong, but it does not take, concrete measures? Although the accused state does not suffer from the responding measures, but the harm to its fame and reputation has been inflicted. Under such circumstances, should the accusing state be held partially responsible for the false attribution, sometimes intentionally? Would belittlement of this question encourage even more ill-substantiated public attribution? This issue deserves more international discussion.\n## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution\nAgainst the challenges posed by ill-substantiated public attribution, tentative solutions should be sought as per the three dimensions analytical framework, with due consideration paid to technical, political, and legal dimensions, respectively. Contrary proposals have been made to establish a centralized international attribution mechanism,$^{72}$ and to keep the current system of decentralized public–private attributions working.$^{73}$ As this paper particularly takes the perspective of legal lens, an international norm on responsible state’s behavior in public attribution is thus proposed as a possible way forward.\nIn this regard, UN GGE has provided a sound basis by repeatedly emphasizing in its final reports that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts\n$^{67}$ Sklerov (2009).\n$^{68}$ The White House (2012).\n$^{69}$ Schmitt (2017b).\n$^{70}$ ARSIWA, Commentaries, art. 49(3).\n$^{71}$ Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 97–109.\n$^{72}$ Shany and Schmitt (2020).\n$^{73}$ Eichensehr (2019).\nbrought against states should be substantiated.” Righteous in its nature though, this norm only points out the need for accusations to be substantiated but fails to elaborate how. Vis-à-vis the legal deficiencies previously identified, and bearing in mind the law of diminishing marginal utility, a norm on responsible public attribution should embody the following points.\n### Starting with an Out-of-The-Box Thought\nPrivate consultation before making cyber attribution public does not involve an ill-substantiation problem, as it will be confined in a confidential environment. If this becomes a mandatory preliminary step, improvement could be expected, because such procedural mechanism has proved to be useful in cutting down interstate disputes in other fields of international law. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a noticeable example. According to the relevant WTO rules, disputes are initiated through a formal request for consultations, whereby the complaining member invites the member whose measures are being challenged to discuss the disputed matter in order to resolve it without recourse to further litigation. Such consultation is mandatory, confidential, and with a time limit. If a similar mechanism exists in cyber conflict, the accusing state has a great chance to first consult privately with the accused state, channeling its interest demands without forcing the latter into an awkward position.\n### On Attribution Criteria\nState should refrain from removing key elements from due diligence rule to expand the coverage of another state's responsibility scope. Against the urgent need to cope with seriously damaging cybercrimes as ransomware, it may be too rash to argue straightforward for the existence of due diligence obligation to counter, in spite of no primary rule on such behavior. To better balance the position of the disputing states, and to better meet the challenge from ransomware and the like, it may be desirable to envisage a burden to investigate assumed by the accused state, provided that the accusing state can support its claim with satisfied evidence.\nOn Evidentiary Requirement\nThe standards of proof should be set in principle by the “clear and convincing” test, and shall increase as the seriousness of the accusation enhances. It is recommended that private channels be used to demonstrate early evidence. In this way, the accusing state is able to send a credible signal about its awareness and knowledge of the malicious operation, while the accused state has enough policy space—and face—to maneuver.\n### On Legal Consequence\nIt should be clear that the international wrongfulness of the responding measures taken by the accusing state cannot be justified by attribution wrongfully made on the basis of error in factual assessment. More ideally, states should act with good faith not making unsolidified accusations.\nA combined norm on attribution rule, evidentiary requirement, and legal consequence of erroneous attribution could be termed as. (1) A state cannot be held internationally legally responsible solely for an ICT activity launched or otherwise originates from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. (2) A state should substantiate its public attribution with adequate level evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a “clear and convincing” case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. (3) A state should refrain from taking responding measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making erroneous or falsified attribution.\n## Conclusion\nStrictly, the attribution under international law is but one of the two indispensable components in determining internationally wrongful acts, the other being the breach of an international obligation. A thorough discussion of attribution cannot do without addressing primary rules on cyber operations, either. This has been shown in previous analysis regarding due diligence. But still, the attribution discussion bears meaning, especially when it relates to some important legal deficiencies.\nRecent development is featured by the states beginning to favor public attribution as a policy tool. France consistently holds a cautious attitude toward public attribution, when it views naming an enemy, especially if it is a sovereign state, as a political act that requires highest level of decision. When France officially\n\nattributed a cyberattack for the first time, $^{78}$  in July 2021, it represents \"a subtle shift in the implementation of its attribution strategy.\" $^{79}$  China, the most frequent receiver of cyber public attributions, also made its first practice in 2021 through a private cyber security firm, claiming Indian source malicious cyber operations have been trying to infiltrate into sensitive zones within China's cyber domain. $^{80}$\nAgainst this backdrop, the expected marginal benefit from substantiated claims would greatly outweigh the marginal cost to substantiate the claim according to a set of commonly acceptable codes of conduct. A norm on responsible public attribution may be just on time to save the world from a chaotic blame game.\nAcknowledgements The author would extend the deepest appreciation to George Perkovich, Ariel Levite, Jon Bateman, Scott Collard, June Lee from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to Chuanying Lu, Manshu Xu from Shanghai Institute for International Studies, and to Yan Li from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, for their insightful critiques on earlier drafts of this Article.",

Helpful in understanding such attribution practice are three commonly recognized dimensions, respectively, from technical, political, and legal perspectives. Compared to confidentially processed attribution, to publicly blame a state should be better substantiated. But as legal deficiencies in the current body of international law, apart from also some technical obstacles, cannot live up to the political desire of the accuser to make public attribution, the ill-substantiation problem becomes prominent. Debates over the \"control test\" and misuse of due diligence principle in cyber scenarios extend the responsibility scope of the territorial state. Lack of essential evidentiary requirements cripples the predictability and falsifiability for bringing up accusation. Inculpability for erroneous attribution invites the accusing state's recklessness. In light of these legal deficiencies, an international norm on responsible state behavior for public attribution could be a promising way forward.\nKeywords Ill-Substantiated public attribution  $\\cdot$  Due diligence  $\\cdot$  Evidentiary requirements  $\\cdot$  Erroneous attribution  $\\cdot$  Responsible state behavior\nThis chapter is a fully revised and expanded article developed with permission from the author's earlier contribution to a research report on Managing U.S.-China Tensions Over Public Cyber Attribution, published by Carnegie Peaceful Endowment in March 2022.

Yang\n# Introduction\nThe history for states to publicly attribute malicious cyber operations to an alleged accused is not long. Although being the most frequent user of such policy tool, the US government's debut only came in 2014, when five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were indicted in a district court in the US, for hacking American companies for intellectual property. A more prominent example is the denunciation made by the Biden Administration in 2021, also echoed by some of its allies, over China's Ministry of State Security for maintaining a network of criminal contract hackers responsible for the Microsoft Exchange Server attack that affected large group of worldwide users.\nNo wonder, after a state—either its governmental system or private businesses therein—suffers from malicious cyber operations by a foreign actor, it is tempting to identify and hold publicly accountable whoever it believes is responsible for that misbehavior. With an intention to deter malice and encourage order, such self-help effort can seemingly be of value to an underregulated cyberspace.\nWhen cyberspace just began to show its impact on international affairs, it was once a common fear that, with its unique architecture and operational process, \"the Internet is perfect for plausible deniability.\" The recent tide of public attribution—especially ill-substantiated ones among them—is no panacea against such fear, but rather seems to be a hypercorrection. For the international society, neither direction is satisfactory. The ultimate question to ask should then be: how to strike a balance between these conflicting interests, so that the bad agents in cyberspace cannot easily escape from penalty, while reckless public accusation also comes with a nonnegligible consequence.\n To clarify, this Article uses the term \"cyber operation\" to incorporate different categories of cyber activities, including cyberattack which may amount to a use of force or armed attack in the sense of international law, and cyber espionage which refers to the large variety of below the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) activities in cyber \"grey zone,\" and also cyber-criminal activities, which does not trigger state responsibility in the strict and traditional sense, but may be changing in the cyber scenario.\nOn another note, this Article focuses on public attribution made by states. Entities other than states can also publicly attribute blame for a cyber operation, but for different aims and subject to different rules, if any. Private corporations, usually cyber security firms, may aim to enhance their influence, cultivate market demands, and ultimately cash out by selling products, services, and solutions on cybersecurity. Media may simply want an eye-catching story and may be easily manipulated by customized feeds of source information provided by enterprises or state organs. Since it falls outside of the purview of international law, the problem with these entities making public attribution merits a separate piece of analysis.\n Dong et al. (2014). Some commentator coined this as \"attribution by indictment,\" see Keitner (2019).\n The White House (2021).\n Among them are the EU, NATO, and UK. See, e.g., Council of the EU (2021, UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, National Cyber Security Centre, and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP (2021), NATO (2021).\n Brenner (2009).\n\nFor the latter part of the query, this article would propose that public attribution requires a timely calibration especially from the legal viewpoint. Otherwise, it may incur extra problem, as any accuser naturally tends to point fingers rather recklessly if no effective curb exists. To illustrate, Sect. 14.2 will usher in a widely used analytical framework to dissect cyber public attribution process, point out the ill-substantiation problem, and demonstrate its destabilizing nature. Section 14.3 will focus on three types of legal deficiencies in extant international law that enable and encourage ill-substantiated public attribution. Section 14.4 will then propose the norm on responsible public attribution as a possible way forward.\n## The Problem with Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\n## Three-Dimension Framework to Interrogate Public Attribution\nThe effort of cyber public attribution entails three generally recognized considerations, which stem from technical, political, and legal perspectives, respectively.\nFirst, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and restore the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is in large part a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber operation back to a machine or a location. Yet, pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires corroboration from human intelligence as well. It goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law.\nAlthough for tech experts like Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of a cyber security firm Crowdstrike, “identifying who is responsible … is now largely a solved problem,” states’ capabilities to associate an attack with a responsible party through technical means are far from evenly distributed. Asymmetric pattern of attribution practice can thus be deduced from such technical impurity, as the capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.\nSecond, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decision to\n For pioneering work to review the exercise of “matching an offender to an offence … in minimizing uncertainty” on tactical, operational, and strategical levels. See Rid and Buchanan (2015).\n Alperovitch (2018).\n The impurity of cyber capabilities among states, including that to attribute, has been assessed and largely validated by many empirical studies. For one example, see The International Institute for Strategic Studies (2021).\n For chart illustrations covering the period of 2015–2020 verifying this deduction, see Garrett Derian-Toth et al. (2021). Not surprisingly, top five countries that made the most use of public attributions are all from Five Eyes Alliance, and China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been identified as the responsible actors for 75% of all state-sponsored offensive cyber operations.\nmake, such as whether, when and in what form to publicly hold the actor accountable, or whether to call for coordinated actions from allies. As has been righteously noted, this political decision making is “a highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.” The accusing state may be influenced by a complex matrix of political intentions, including, inter alia: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms.\nCompatible with this complexity, different forms of public attributions have also been developed for different case scenarios. The US, for example, can make public cyber attribution by indicting foreign criminal, imposing economic sanctions, sending out technical alerts, and issuing official statements or press releases. To sum up, a state's decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.\nThird, from a legal perspective, public attribution means imputation by connecting the offense to an offender according to applicable rules, either domestic or international. For purpose of this chapter, domestic imputation—such as indictment against foreign individuals—is left undiscussed; specific focus is put on cases intending to establish state responsibility as per applicable international law. Within this limit, legal attribution also serves as a basis to legitimize future responding measures, such as self-defense or other forms of countermeasures the accusing state may take, depending on the nature and severity of the original malicious cyber operations. Ideally, the international legal system should provide clear guidance regarding rules for attribution. However, the current body of international law is seriously inadequate on this issue, which, as will be explained, is the very root of the problem.\nIt's worthy to note that states may still publicly accuse others of conducting unwanted cyber operations regardless of any clear legal basis for doing so. For example, the US officially holds that political attribution in the form of official announcements does not require meeting any legal standards in the strict sense. This well reflects the complexity embedded within public attribution practice as to its diversified form and purpose.\n\n## Substantiation as the Problem\nCompared to attribution that is confidentially processed and privately communicated, it is only logical that public attribution should be better supported. Conversely, however, public attribution is particularly susceptible to the problem of ill-substantiation, if not the absence of substantiation at all. The fundamental cause is that—to use the language of the three dimensions analytical framework—the political desire to publicly blame adversary state cannot be properly checked and balanced, due to technical impurity and the lack of legal restraints. Under strong political impetus to publicly blame the accused state, the technically capable state seems to enjoy taking advantage of the lawless status quo.\nThe term “ill-substantiated public attribution” is thereby specifically coined. It refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assigns responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. This problem lies in moving scale, rather than a simple yes-or-no judgment. As regards this concept, three illustrating points are necessary.\nFirst, the appropriate level of substantiation should match the purpose and form of public attribution. Take an extreme case as example. Here, a state is held publicly responsible for carrying out cyber operations that amount to an armed attack, activating the victim state’s right to self-defense. Obviously, such a claim is subject to challenge unless it can be unequivocally supported. Another comparable situation occurs when there is a breach of general international legal obligation of non-intervention, and the accusing state aims to establish responsibility that can justify its future countermeasures. The requirement to prove this latter claim should be appropriately downsized.\nSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among two opposite camps of states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated. The US and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can thereby “act reasonably under the circumstances.” The most updated result of such contention is reflected in the 2021 report of the UN GGE, when it emphasized again that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful\n Some have noted that different purposes of public attribution relate to different levels of evidence. See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, p 558.\n It is a long-debated question as to when does cyber operations fall within the meaning of “armed attack” in the language of Art. 51 of UN Charter. See, e.g., Dev (2015).\n Finlay and Payne (2019).\n China, Russia, et al. (2018).\n Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan (2017). Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\nacts brought against states should be substantiated.” The connotation that only verified accusation stands is clear, but the \"how\" question remains untouched.\nThird, ill-substantiated public attribution problem should be addressed in marginal sense rather than in average or absolute sense. Solid substantiation brings positive yield, which helps to produce long-term credibility and stability. But it also means cost. The author tends not to go extreme on the requirement of substantiation, paying no attention to the constraint condition of cost. Against this backdrop, the law of diminishing marginal utility instructs that the logical deduction to stop is the point where marginal cost for extra substantiation cannot be covered by the added yield it may bring. As per this logic, the most productive phase in terms of legalization is exactly when the world moves from the lawless status quo to a more disciplined and transparent regime of public attribution.\n### Destabilizing Nature of Reckless Accusation\nAlthough public attribution per se will not necessarily pose a problem, the ill-substantiated public attribution is unhelpful in securing the political pursuits of the accusing state, as has been previously listed.\nPublic attribution is often justified as a policy tool to ease domestic pressure to react against a foreign malicious cyber operation. By telling a falsified or incomplete story, an ill-substantiated—and thus unhealthy—public attribution tends to exaggerate the efficiency and the fierceness of the authority, but seldom with satisfying answer from those crucified. This may breed populism, which will in turn squeeze the policy space.\nCritiques on the credibleness of cyber deterrence often builds on the observation that cyber attribution is difficult and manageable from the side of a hidden attacker. Making ill-substantiated public attribution would only worsen this situation, because reckless accusation is insufficient to legitimize possible responding measures from the deterring state, and therefore is a cheap form of signaling in the eyes of a potential adversary. By the same token, naming and shaming are unlikely to work as previously anticipated by the accusing state, because reckless finger-pointing may be interpreted as slandering and defamation.\nIn some cases, a state pursues to exert more deterring influence by bringing its ally to form a collective attribution. To clarify, a mere increase in the number of the accusing side is probably useful in making a fuss, but it will not enhance the legitimacy of an attribution. For each claim to stand, the robustness of the legal logic and the completeness of the evidence still play a decisive role.\nIll-substantiated public attribution contributes little—if not brings outright detriment—to norm-building, as it relies on the incompleteness of applicable rules. When a state deems itself in an advantageous position in the game of accusing\n\n## Legal Deficiencies that Enable Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\nAs mentioned, international law serves as the basis to impute the accused state in relation to malicious cyber operations. State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law. Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution.\nThe deficiencies are threefold: (1) international rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios; (2) international legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular; and (3) legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attribution are not clearly defined.\n## Attribution Rules\nGeneral international law recognizes that attribution rules have been compiled in International Law Commission’s draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), particularly Articles 4 through 11. ARSIWA was adopted by the UN General Assembly, and is considered by both courts and commentators to be a fine codification of customary international law. Linking state organs’ activity to that state as per ARSIWA proves to be less troublesome. But when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors, to ascribe the agency to a state agent is no easy task. Unfortunately, most of the cyber attributions are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate\n Art. 2 of ARSIWA.\n (28 Jan 2002) General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, UN Doc (A/RES/56/83). https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/56/83.\n Crawford (2013).\nF. Yang\nactor's behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial. Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.\nRegarding the legal standard of the level of control required for attribution to occur, two generally recognized approaches[29] are the \"effective control\" test devised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,[30] and the \"overall control\" test developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Tadic decision.[31] Some argue that the \"overall control\" test should prevail in scenarios of cyber attribution, because the \"effective control\" test is far stricter and thus may function as \"a free pass to state sponsorship of cyberattacks.\"[32]\nThis proposal is far from a suitable solution for two reasons.[33] First, both of the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the nonstate actor, so that they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control. Second, the \"overall control\" standard was explicitly confined to \"organized and hierarchically structured groups\" such as military or paramilitary units,[34] while, as a matter of juridical fact, the stricter \"effective control\" test has been upheld in determining attribution concerning the acts of individuals or non-organized groups.\nConsidering how difficult it is to persuasively demonstrate that a state is effectively or generally controlling a nonstate entity, an alternative would be to hold states responsible for regulating or preventing unauthorized persons or groups from conducting malicious cyber operations within their jurisdictions. This potentially more qualified candidate of attribution rules is captured by the proposal to extend the application of \"due diligence\" in a cyber scenario. Due diligence is a notion first recognized by the ICJ in Corfu Channel.[35] Academic viewpoints among international lawyers are rather unanimous to import due diligence to cyber context, but are competing to categorize it as a primary rule of international obligation over state conduct,[36] or as a secondary rule to determine violation.[37]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare defines due diligence as a substantive obligation[38]; the United Nations Group of Government Experts (UN GEE) report endorses this approach with similar\n[29] Ibid, pp 146–154.\n[30] Case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA), Merits, (27 Jun 1986) ICJ Report.\n[31] Prosecutor v.

Tadic, paras. 131, 137.\n[35] The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Merits, ICJ Report, 1949.\n[36] Shackelford et al. (2016), Jensen and Watts (2021).\n[37] Mackenzie and Scott (2021), Chircop (2018).\n[38] Schmitt (2017a), Rule 6. The rule reads: \"State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other states.\"\n\nwording. Per this understanding, the original task of attributing malicious cyber operations to a territorial state no longer requires an answer. A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, the following six commonly recognized elements should be fulfilled: (1) The existence of acts (by a nonstate actor or a third state) contrary to the rights of a victim state; (2) which are conducted from or through the territory of the potentially responsible state (or from or through the territory or cyber infrastructure under its control); (3) which would have been unlawful if conducted by the potentially responsible state; (4) which have serious adverse consequences for the victim state; (5) with respect to which the potentially responsible state has actual or constructive knowledge; and (6) upon which the potentially responsible state can act, but fails to take all feasible measures.\nAmong them, the third element on the unlawfulness test deserves a separate note, especially under the backdrop of a recently appeared expansionist view. According to such a view, territorial state is imputable for certain malicious cyber operations, even though they cannot unquestionably be categorized as internationally wrongful acts for lack of clear primary rules in international law. Combatting ransomware is one such example. Traditionally, ransomware attack is understood as cybercrime, attributable only to private bodies. As cybercrime can easily cross multiple borders, to effectively combat ransomware highly depends on international coordination of law enforcement, but the failure of which should not lead to liability of the territorial state.\nRecent development has overthrown this legal setting when, since the first half year of 2021, an intensive series of ransomware attacks hit the infrastructure and livelihood business worldwide and especially the US. In particular, President Biden publicly alleged that “Russia has some responsibility to deal with this.” After a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on June 16, 2021, he escalated that rhetoric: “Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory.” Some commentators have taken an even more proactive stance. They suggested that as a due diligence obligation, Russia is responsible to curb ransomware gangs in its territory, otherwise the US can legitimately adopt countermeasures including sanctions or military cyber operations. This signals a disturbing tendency to inappropriately broaden territorial state’s international obligation, for activities that happened inside its border that are harmful to another state, even when those activities would have not been unlawful if conducted by that territorial state.\n The Group of Governmental Experts, Report on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n See CCDCOE Cyberlaw Wiki, Due diligence. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Due_diligence.\n Remarks by President Biden on the Economy (2021).\n Remarks by President Biden in Press Conference (2021).\n Harding et al. (2021); Goldsmith (2021). Note there are also other viewpoints justifying the US combating ransomware group in Russian territory as “self-help,” instead of as countermeasure as to Russia’s breach of due diligence obligation. See Corn (2021).\nF. Yang\nTurning to the minority approach of due diligence as an attribution rule, the identification of the actual author shifts to that of state territory where those operations originate. According to such “indirect” or “imputed” attribution,[44] a state is held responsible for the cyber malicious operations harming another state rather than for a breach of its due diligence obligation, provided that the act was launched from computer systems located on its territory, and it failed to take feasible measures against the act. As this unorthodox approach seems a bit excessive, it is no wonder the UN GGE specifically pointed out that “the indication that an ICT [information and communications technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from a state’s territory or from its ICT infrastructure may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.”[45]\nIn light of these contending and confusing viewpoints, misusing and abusing “due diligence” to forge a legal logic to back up public attribution claims could facilitate ill-substantiation. It is thus important to reiterate the following points. First, “due diligence,” if imported to the cyber scenario, should be better understood as setting an obligation for a state rather than serving as a way to attribute. Second, the actual occurrence of a harmful cyber incident, which would have been unlawful if conducted by a potentially responsible state, is a prerequisite for the injured state to claim a due diligence violation. Third, even if state responsibility is successfully established along the legal path of due diligence, the responding measures that the accusing state might legitimately take should proportionately reflect the fact that the accused state did not conduct the malicious activities but, less harmfully, failed to address them with all feasible measures.\n## Evidentiary Requirements[46]\nGeneral international law has not yet developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence. Key evidentiary issues such as burden and standard of proof are normally evaluated on an ad hoc basis. For cyber disputes, such ambiguity can be interpreted as a loophole that allows states to carry out malicious cyber operations hoping for no consequence; or it can also be interpreted as an opportunity that allows states to sometimes make public attributions “reasonably under the circumstances,”[47] sometimes rather recklessly.\n[44] Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, p 91.\n[45] Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n[46] Some commentator deems the evidentiary requirement in legal argument on cyber issues as a deadlock problem, which has no solution, so long as one sticks to an interventionist approach to impose international law on cyber operations. See d'Aspremont (2016).\n[47] Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan BJ, op. cit. 22, p 177. Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\n\nOf those two evidentiary issues, burden of proof is less controversial. It is generally recognized that in \"a bilateral dispute over state responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant state.\"48 As a mechanism specifically tailored for cyber attribution, some proposed a shift of the burden of proof scheme, referred to as a \"virtual control\" test.49 The main argument behind this idea is that in cyber disputes, the territorial state for the alleged misbehavior has better access to the knowledge necessary to verify certain facts. By this mechanism, a prima facie responsibility would be established for the territorial state, unless it can provide evidence showing otherwise. It is not hard to imagine that this would probably cause more trouble than it intends to solve.50\nRegarding the standard of proof, a generally observed practice is that evidentiary standards should vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. Established ICJ cases also emphasized the importance to keep standard of proof transparent in the judgments.[51] Through a comparative assessment of international litigation, one can identify a few recognizable levels of hierarchy on standards of proof, largely borrowed from the domestic legal system of common law countries.[52]\nAs the highest level of requirement of standard of proof, \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" has its root in criminal cases and embodies the value of presumption of innocence. It requires a full chain of evidence, weighing together heavily toward one direction that forms a virtually indisputable claim. In international juridical forum, such standard is usually mandatory to substantiate a guilty verdict, as is made clear in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court regarding international criminal liability.[53] The ICJ held in a few of its cases that, \"claims against a state involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive...same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\"[54] Because a cyberattack amounts to an international crime with exceptional gravity, to substantiate its attribution should meet \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement.\nIn some cases, a preponderance of evidence is sufficient to support a legal claim. This lower level of requirement for the standard of proof concerns mainly the balance of probabilities of the two sides, which will favor the party with a more likely than not argument. In this regard, judges have vast discretionary power. As a result, extant\n\nF. Yang\ncases that adopt \"preponderance standard\" exclusively address territory issues, which rarely involve state responsibility.\nWith some room for debate, the ICJ cases and state practices support the “clear and convincing” standard for cases on use of force. This requirement for the standard of proof lies in between preponderance and beyond-reasonable-doubt standard. As self-defense is a legitimate exception against prohibition of using force, to substantiate a self-defense case—in normal or cyber scenario—should also adopt the “clear and convincing” standard. In other regular cases, the amount of certainty the ICJ generally requires seems also to be clear and convincing evidence by parties. To prove a cyber attribution regarding use of force, the “clear and convincing” standard is applicable, since “reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.”\nTo sum up, the international legal practice, mainly reflected by the ICJ’s case law, so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation. Based on this premise, the adequate default level of evidence for cyber public attribution should better be set around “clear and convincing” standard, with a sliding scale from “preponderance evidence” up to “proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Exactly which standard prevails should match the severity of the claim on a case-by-case basis. One potential choice is to argue that cyber attribution for self-defense requires “clear and convincing” standard, while, for lower countermeasure level, the preponderance standard would suffice. However, this should not become a strict legal test, due to the complexity of real-life cases.\nApart from the complex standard of proof debate, a safer bottom line for the evidentiary requirement could be drawn from general principle of procedural law: in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking. Especially in cyber attribution cases, this can be a proper guideline to counterbalance a convenient excuse of the accusing state to justify its selective disclosure of limited material in the name of prevention of divulging intelligence secrets. It is an important mechanism to bolster an attribution’s credibility by providing sufficient evidence to allow the accused state and other potential stakeholders to confirm or debunk.\n The Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Saldavor/Honduras), ICJ Judgment of 11 September 1992, para. 248; Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Pateh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore), ICJ Judgment of 23 May 2008, para. 86.\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Uganda), ICJ Judgment of 2005, ICJ Reports (2005), paras. 72, 91, 136.\n O’Connell (2002); Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 559–562.\n Teitelbaum (2007).\n See Schmitt (2011).\n Brunner et al. (2019).\n Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 576–586.\n Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 28.\n\nSome may disfavor the above discussion on setting an evidentiary standard. They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, while most cyber public attribution cases will not ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and nature of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, “Even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.”[63] In the sense of facilitating customary law on evidentiary requirement, the formation of opinio juris may take some time, but it will never happen if the world is stuck to its current awkward status. The necessity and urgency are especially true for supporters of the “instant” international customary law.[64]\nAnother opposing viewpoint is that it is hard to reconcile the evidentiary requirement on cyber attribution on one hand with the necessity to make a timely attribution on the other.[65] This dilemma indeed exists. It should be subject to careful evaluation in a context-specific approach. Again, challenges in collecting and exhibiting evidence should not excuse evidence-less accusations.\n## Erroneous Attribution\nIf a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous—or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations—what legal consequences would the accusing state face? Underdevelopment of this legal issue will provide extra room for ill-substantiated public attribution, because no foreseeable punishment exists for irresponsible or erroneous allegations. However, current international law on this issue is tricky,[66] not to mention that technical hurdles against a confident attribution in cyber brings extra complexity to this problem.\nTo begin with, it is safe to infer that, once the attribution proves to be based on false facts, the international wrongfulness of the subsequent self-defense or countermeasure adopted by the accusing state cannot be unquestionably eliminated. In other words, the accusing state may be held responsible for taking unjustified steps against the accused state. As a counterargument, the accusing state may propose that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith. Could claims of “reasonableness” and “honesty” exonerate its false judgment?\n[63] Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 571–572.\n[64] Bin Cheng first put forward the notion of \"instant\" international customary law in a discussion on outer space law. See Bin Cheng, United Nations Resolutions on Outer Space: ‘Instant’ International Customary Law? In: Bin Cheng (1997).\n[65] Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 32.\n[66] Milanovic (2020).\nF. Yang\nPositive view is echoed by some scholarly papers$^{67}$ as well as official statements.$^{68}$ For example, Tallinn Manuel 2.0 explicitly asserts:\nthe exercise of the right of self-defense... is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made *ex ante*, not *ex post facto*. Their reasonableness will be assessed based upon the information available at the time they were made, not in light of information that subsequently becomes available.$^{69}$\nOther commentators opine that with good faith or not, wrongful attribution in the first place will nonetheless make subsequent measures the fruit of a poisonous tree. The ILC holds such view in its commentary to Article 49(1) of ARSIWA.$^{70}$ If, during an *ex post* examination, the attribution tends to be wrongful because of errors in *ex ante* factual assessment, the mistaken state may be responsible whether its agents had acted in good faith or not.$^{71}$\nLast but not least, what if the accusing state makes a public attribution that later proves wrong, but it does not take, concrete measures? Although the accused state does not suffer from the responding measures, but the harm to its fame and reputation has been inflicted. Under such circumstances, should the accusing state be held partially responsible for the false attribution, sometimes intentionally? Would belittlement of this question encourage even more ill-substantiated public attribution? This issue deserves more international discussion.\n## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution\nAgainst the challenges posed by ill-substantiated public attribution, tentative solutions should be sought as per the three dimensions analytical framework, with due consideration paid to technical, political, and legal dimensions, respectively. Contrary proposals have been made to establish a centralized international attribution mechanism,$^{72}$ and to keep the current system of decentralized public–private attributions working.$^{73}$ As this paper particularly takes the perspective of legal lens, an international norm on responsible state’s behavior in public attribution is thus proposed as a possible way forward.\nIn this regard, UN GGE has provided a sound basis by repeatedly emphasizing in its final reports that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts\n$^{67}$ Sklerov (2009).\n$^{68}$ The White House (2012).\n$^{69}$ Schmitt (2017b).\n$^{70}$ ARSIWA, Commentaries, art. 49(3).\n$^{71}$ Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 97–109.\n$^{72}$ Shany and Schmitt (2020).\n$^{73}$ Eichensehr (2019).\nbrought against states should be substantiated.” Righteous in its nature though, this norm only points out the need for accusations to be substantiated but fails to elaborate how. Vis-à-vis the legal deficiencies previously identified, and bearing in mind the law of diminishing marginal utility, a norm on responsible public attribution should embody the following points.\n### Starting with an Out-of-The-Box Thought\nPrivate consultation before making cyber attribution public does not involve an ill-substantiation problem, as it will be confined in a confidential environment. If this becomes a mandatory preliminary step, improvement could be expected, because such procedural mechanism has proved to be useful in cutting down interstate disputes in other fields of international law. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a noticeable example. According to the relevant WTO rules, disputes are initiated through a formal request for consultations, whereby the complaining member invites the member whose measures are being challenged to discuss the disputed matter in order to resolve it without recourse to further litigation. Such consultation is mandatory, confidential, and with a time limit. If a similar mechanism exists in cyber conflict, the accusing state has a great chance to first consult privately with the accused state, channeling its interest demands without forcing the latter into an awkward position.\n### On Attribution Criteria\nState should refrain from removing key elements from due diligence rule to expand the coverage of another state's responsibility scope. Against the urgent need to cope with seriously damaging cybercrimes as ransomware, it may be too rash to argue straightforward for the existence of due diligence obligation to counter, in spite of no primary rule on such behavior. To better balance the position of the disputing states, and to better meet the challenge from ransomware and the like, it may be desirable to envisage a burden to investigate assumed by the accused state, provided that the accusing state can support its claim with satisfied evidence.\nOn Evidentiary Requirement\nThe standards of proof should be set in principle by the “clear and convincing” test, and shall increase as the seriousness of the accusation enhances. It is recommended that private channels be used to demonstrate early evidence. In this way, the accusing state is able to send a credible signal about its awareness and knowledge of the malicious operation, while the accused state has enough policy space—and face—to maneuver.\n### On Legal Consequence\nIt should be clear that the international wrongfulness of the responding measures taken by the accusing state cannot be justified by attribution wrongfully made on the basis of error in factual assessment. More ideally, states should act with good faith not making unsolidified accusations.\nA combined norm on attribution rule, evidentiary requirement, and legal consequence of erroneous attribution could be termed as. (1) A state cannot be held internationally legally responsible solely for an ICT activity launched or otherwise originates from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. (2) A state should substantiate its public attribution with adequate level evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a “clear and convincing” case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. (3) A state should refrain from taking responding measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making erroneous or falsified attribution.\n## Conclusion\nStrictly, the attribution under international law is but one of the two indispensable components in determining internationally wrongful acts, the other being the breach of an international obligation. A thorough discussion of attribution cannot do without addressing primary rules on cyber operations, either. This has been shown in previous analysis regarding due diligence. But still, the attribution discussion bears meaning, especially when it relates to some important legal deficiencies.\nRecent development is featured by the states beginning to favor public attribution as a policy tool. France consistently holds a cautious attitude toward public attribution, when it views naming an enemy, especially if it is a sovereign state, as a political act that requires highest level of decision. When France officially\n\nattributed a cyberattack for the first time, $^{78}$  in July 2021, it represents \"a subtle shift in the implementation of its attribution strategy.\" $^{79}$  China, the most frequent receiver of cyber public attributions, also made its first practice in 2021 through a private cyber security firm, claiming Indian source malicious cyber operations have been trying to infiltrate into sensitive zones within China's cyber domain. $^{80}$\nAgainst this backdrop, the expected marginal benefit from substantiated claims would greatly outweigh the marginal cost to substantiate the claim according to a set of commonly acceptable codes of conduct. A norm on responsible public attribution may be just on time to save the world from a chaotic blame game.\nAcknowledgements The author would extend the deepest appreciation to George Perkovich, Ariel Levite, Jon Bateman, Scott Collard, June Lee from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to Chuanying Lu, Manshu Xu from Shanghai Institute for International Studies, and to Yan Li from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, for their insightful critiques on earlier drafts of this Article."

Helpful in understanding such attribution practice are three commonly recognized dimensions, respectively, from technical, political, and legal perspectives. Compared to confidentially processed attribution, to publicly blame a state should be better substantiated. But as legal deficiencies in the current body of international law, apart from also some technical obstacles, cannot live up to the political desire of the accuser to make public attribution, the ill-substantiation problem becomes prominent. Debates over the \"control test\" and misuse of due diligence principle in cyber scenarios extend the responsibility scope of the territorial state. Lack of essential evidentiary requirements cripples the predictability and falsifiability for bringing up accusation. Inculpability for erroneous attribution invites the accusing state's recklessness. In light of these legal deficiencies, an international norm on responsible state behavior for public attribution could be a promising way forward.\nKeywords Ill-Substantiated public attribution  $\\cdot$  Due diligence  $\\cdot$  Evidentiary requirements  $\\cdot$  Erroneous attribution  $\\cdot$  Responsible state behavior\nThis chapter is a fully revised and expanded article developed with permission from the author's earlier contribution to a research report on Managing U.S.-China Tensions Over Public Cyber Attribution, published by Carnegie Peaceful Endowment in March 2022.

Yang\n# Introduction\nThe history for states to publicly attribute malicious cyber operations to an alleged accused is not long.¹ Although being the most frequent user of such policy tool, the US government's debut only came in 2014, when five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were indicted in a district court in the US, for hacking American companies for intellectual property.² A more prominent example is the denunciation made by the Biden Administration in 2021,³ also echoed by some of its allies,⁴ over China's Ministry of State Security for maintaining a network of criminal contract hackers responsible for the Microsoft Exchange Server attack that affected large group of worldwide users.\nNo wonder, after a state—either its governmental system or private businesses therein—suffers from malicious cyber operations by a foreign actor, it is tempting to identify and hold publicly accountable whoever it believes is responsible for that misbehavior. With an intention to deter malice and encourage order, such self-help effort can seemingly be of value to an underregulated cyberspace.\nWhen cyberspace just began to show its impact on international affairs, it was once a common fear that, with its unique architecture and operational process, \"the Internet is perfect for plausible deniability.\"⁵ The recent tide of public attribution—especially ill-substantiated ones among them—is no panacea against such fear, but rather seems to be a hypercorrection. For the international society, neither direction is satisfactory. The ultimate question to ask should then be: how to strike a balance between these conflicting interests, so that the bad agents in cyberspace cannot easily escape from penalty, while reckless public accusation also comes with a nonnegligible consequence.\n¹ To clarify, this Article uses the term \"cyber operation\" to incorporate different categories of cyber activities, including cyberattack which may amount to a use of force or armed attack in the sense of international law, and cyber espionage which refers to the large variety of below the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) activities in cyber \"grey zone,\" and also cyber-criminal activities, which does not trigger state responsibility in the strict and traditional sense, but may be changing in the cyber scenario.\nOn another note, this Article focuses on public attribution made by states. Entities other than states can also publicly attribute blame for a cyber operation, but for different aims and subject to different rules, if any. Private corporations, usually cyber security firms, may aim to enhance their influence, cultivate market demands, and ultimately cash out by selling products, services, and solutions on cybersecurity. Media may simply want an eye-catching story and may be easily manipulated by customized feeds of source information provided by enterprises or state organs. Since it falls outside of the purview of international law, the problem with these entities making public attribution merits a separate piece of analysis.\n² Dong et al. (2014). Some commentator coined this as \"attribution by indictment,\" see Keitner (2019).\n³ The White House (2021).\n⁴ Among them are the EU, NATO, and UK. See, e.g., Council of the EU (2021, UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, National Cyber Security Centre, and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP (2021), NATO (2021).\n⁵ Brenner (2009).\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\nFor the latter part of the query, this article would propose that public attribution requires a timely calibration especially from the legal viewpoint. Otherwise, it may incur extra problem, as any accuser naturally tends to point fingers rather recklessly if no effective curb exists. To illustrate, Sect. 14.2 will usher in a widely used analytical framework to dissect cyber public attribution process, point out the ill-substantiation problem, and demonstrate its destabilizing nature. Section 14.3 will focus on three types of legal deficiencies in extant international law that enable and encourage ill-substantiated public attribution. Section 14.4 will then propose the norm on responsible public attribution as a possible way forward.\n## The Problem with Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\n## Three-Dimension Framework to Interrogate Public Attribution\nThe effort of cyber public attribution entails three generally recognized considerations, which stem from technical, political, and legal perspectives, respectively.⁶\nFirst, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and restore the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is in large part a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber operation back to a machine or a location. Yet, pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires corroboration from human intelligence as well. It goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law.\nAlthough for tech experts like Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of a cyber security firm Crowdstrike, “identifying who is responsible … is now largely a solved problem,”⁷ states’ capabilities to associate an attack with a responsible party through technical means are far from evenly distributed.⁸ Asymmetric pattern of attribution practice can thus be deduced from such technical impurity, as the capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.⁹\nSecond, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decision to\n⁶ For pioneering work to review the exercise of “matching an offender to an offence … in minimizing uncertainty” on tactical, operational, and strategical levels. See Rid and Buchanan (2015).\n⁷ Alperovitch (2018).\n⁸ The impurity of cyber capabilities among states, including that to attribute, has been assessed and largely validated by many empirical studies. For one example, see The International Institute for Strategic Studies (2021).\n⁹ For chart illustrations covering the period of 2015–2020 verifying this deduction, see Garrett Derian-Toth et al. (2021). Not surprisingly, top five countries that made the most use of public attributions are all from Five Eyes Alliance, and China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been identified as the responsible actors for 75% of all state-sponsored offensive cyber operations.\nmake, such as whether, when and in what form to publicly hold the actor accountable, or whether to call for coordinated actions from allies. As has been righteously noted, this political decision making is “a highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.” The accusing state may be influenced by a complex matrix of political intentions, including, inter alia: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms.\nCompatible with this complexity, different forms of public attributions have also been developed for different case scenarios. The US, for example, can make public cyber attribution by indicting foreign criminal, imposing economic sanctions, sending out technical alerts, and issuing official statements or press releases. To sum up, a state's decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.\nThird, from a legal perspective, public attribution means imputation by connecting the offense to an offender according to applicable rules, either domestic or international. For purpose of this chapter, domestic imputation—such as indictment against foreign individuals—is left undiscussed; specific focus is put on cases intending to establish state responsibility as per applicable international law. Within this limit, legal attribution also serves as a basis to legitimize future responding measures, such as self-defense or other forms of countermeasures the accusing state may take, depending on the nature and severity of the original malicious cyber operations. Ideally, the international legal system should provide clear guidance regarding rules for attribution. However, the current body of international law is seriously inadequate on this issue, which, as will be explained, is the very root of the problem.\nIt's worthy to note that states may still publicly accuse others of conducting unwanted cyber operations regardless of any clear legal basis for doing so. For example, the US officially holds that political attribution in the form of official announcements does not require meeting any legal standards in the strict sense. This well reflects the complexity embedded within public attribution practice as to its diversified form and purpose.\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\n## Substantiation as the Problem\nCompared to attribution that is confidentially processed and privately communicated, it is only logical that public attribution should be better supported. Conversely, however, public attribution is particularly susceptible to the problem of ill-substantiation, if not the absence of substantiation at all. The fundamental cause is that—to use the language of the three dimensions analytical framework—the political desire to publicly blame adversary state cannot be properly checked and balanced, due to technical impurity and the lack of legal restraints. Under strong political impetus to publicly blame the accused state, the technically capable state seems to enjoy taking advantage of the lawless status quo.\nThe term “ill-substantiated public attribution” is thereby specifically coined. It refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assigns responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. This problem lies in moving scale, rather than a simple yes-or-no judgment. As regards this concept, three illustrating points are necessary.\nFirst, the appropriate level of substantiation should match the purpose and form of public attribution.¹⁸ Take an extreme case as example. Here, a state is held publicly responsible for carrying out cyber operations that amount to an armed attack,¹⁹ activating the victim state’s right to self-defense. Obviously, such a claim is subject to challenge unless it can be unequivocally supported.²⁰ Another comparable situation occurs when there is a breach of general international legal obligation of non-intervention, and the accusing state aims to establish responsibility that can justify its future countermeasures. The requirement to prove this latter claim should be appropriately downsized.\nSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among two opposite camps of states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated.²¹ The US and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can thereby “act reasonably under the circumstances.”²² The most updated result of such contention is reflected in the 2021 report of the UN GGE, when it emphasized again that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful\n¹⁸ Some have noted that different purposes of public attribution relate to different levels of evidence. See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, p 558.\n¹⁹ It is a long-debated question as to when does cyber operations fall within the meaning of “armed attack” in the language of Art. 51 of UN Charter. See, e.g., Dev (2015).\n²⁰ Finlay and Payne (2019).\n²¹ China, Russia, et al. (2018).\n²² Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan (2017). Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\nacts brought against states should be substantiated.” The connotation that only verified accusation stands is clear, but the \"how\" question remains untouched.\nThird, ill-substantiated public attribution problem should be addressed in marginal sense rather than in average or absolute sense. Solid substantiation brings positive yield, which helps to produce long-term credibility and stability. But it also means cost. The author tends not to go extreme on the requirement of substantiation, paying no attention to the constraint condition of cost. Against this backdrop, the law of diminishing marginal utility instructs that the logical deduction to stop is the point where marginal cost for extra substantiation cannot be covered by the added yield it may bring. As per this logic, the most productive phase in terms of legalization is exactly when the world moves from the lawless status quo to a more disciplined and transparent regime of public attribution.\n### Destabilizing Nature of Reckless Accusation\nAlthough public attribution per se will not necessarily pose a problem, the ill-substantiated public attribution is unhelpful in securing the political pursuits of the accusing state, as has been previously listed.\nPublic attribution is often justified as a policy tool to ease domestic pressure to react against a foreign malicious cyber operation. By telling a falsified or incomplete story, an ill-substantiated—and thus unhealthy—public attribution tends to exaggerate the efficiency and the fierceness of the authority, but seldom with satisfying answer from those crucified. This may breed populism, which will in turn squeeze the policy space.\nCritiques on the credibleness of cyber deterrence often builds on the observation that cyber attribution is difficult and manageable from the side of a hidden attacker. Making ill-substantiated public attribution would only worsen this situation, because reckless accusation is insufficient to legitimize possible responding measures from the deterring state, and therefore is a cheap form of signaling in the eyes of a potential adversary. By the same token, naming and shaming are unlikely to work as previously anticipated by the accusing state, because reckless finger-pointing may be interpreted as slandering and defamation.\nIn some cases, a state pursues to exert more deterring influence by bringing its ally to form a collective attribution. To clarify, a mere increase in the number of the accusing side is probably useful in making a fuss, but it will not enhance the legitimacy of an attribution. For each claim to stand, the robustness of the legal logic and the completeness of the evidence still play a decisive role.\nIll-substantiated public attribution contributes little—if not brings outright detriment—to norm-building, as it relies on the incompleteness of applicable rules. When a state deems itself in an advantageous position in the game of accusing\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\n287\nversus accused, it will not have enough impetus to push forward a more elaborate set of rules governing cyber attribution. The current asymmetrical pattern of ill-substantiated public attribution would thus be trapped in a deadlock at the best, and quite likely reinforce itself. This tendency is structurally destabilizing because, a constantly accusing state may make it normal to point fingers without enough substantiation, while a constantly accused state will grow increasingly resentful and eventually erupt. Ill-substantiated public attribution may increase the risk of a successful false-flag operation that incurs conflict.\n## Legal Deficiencies that Enable Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\nAs mentioned, international law serves as the basis to impute the accused state in relation to malicious cyber operations. State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law.²⁶ Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution.\nThe deficiencies are threefold: (1) international rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios; (2) international legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular; and (3) legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attribution are not clearly defined.\n## Attribution Rules\nGeneral international law recognizes that attribution rules have been compiled in International Law Commission’s draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), particularly Articles 4 through 11. ARSIWA was adopted by the UN General Assembly,²⁷ and is considered by both courts and commentators to be a fine codification of customary international law.²⁸ Linking state organs’ activity to that state as per ARSIWA proves to be less troublesome. But when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors, to ascribe the agency to a state agent is no easy task. Unfortunately, most of the cyber attributions are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate\n²⁶ Art. 2 of ARSIWA.\n²⁷ (28 Jan 2002) General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, UN Doc (A/RES/56/83). https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/56/83.\n²⁸ Crawford (2013).\nF. Yang\nactor's behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial. Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.\nRegarding the legal standard of the level of control required for attribution to occur, two generally recognized approaches are the \"effective control\" test devised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case, and the \"overall control\" test developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Tadic decision. Some argue that the \"overall control\" test should prevail in scenarios of cyber attribution, because the \"effective control\" test is far stricter and thus may function as \"a free pass to state sponsorship of cyberattacks.\"\nThis proposal is far from a suitable solution for two reasons. First, both of the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the nonstate actor, so that they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control. Second, the \"overall control\" standard was explicitly confined to \"organized and hierarchically structured groups\" such as military or paramilitary units, while, as a matter of juridical fact, the stricter \"effective control\" test has been upheld in determining attribution concerning the acts of individuals or non-organized groups.\nConsidering how difficult it is to persuasively demonstrate that a state is effectively or generally controlling a nonstate entity, an alternative would be to hold states responsible for regulating or preventing unauthorized persons or groups from conducting malicious cyber operations within their jurisdictions. This potentially more qualified candidate of attribution rules is captured by the proposal to extend the application of \"due diligence\" in a cyber scenario. Due diligence is a notion first recognized by the ICJ in Corfu Channel. Academic viewpoints among international lawyers are rather unanimous to import due diligence to cyber context, but are competing to categorize it as a primary rule of international obligation over state conduct, or as a secondary rule to determine violation.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare defines due diligence as a substantive obligation; the United Nations Group of Government Experts (UN GEE) report endorses this approach with similar\n Ibid, pp 146–154.\n Case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA), Merits, (27 Jun 1986) ICJ Report.\n Prosecutor v. Tadic, Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 Oct 1995) (ICTY-94-1-AR72).\n Shackleford and Andres (2010).\n Lahmann (2020).\n Prosecutor v. Tadic, paras. 131, 137.\n The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Merits, ICJ Report, 1949.\n Shackelford et al. (2016), Jensen and Watts (2021).\n Mackenzie and Scott (2021), Chircop (2018).\n Schmitt (2017a), Rule 6. The rule reads: \"State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other states.\"\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\nwording.³⁹ Per this understanding, the original task of attributing malicious cyber operations to a territorial state no longer requires an answer. A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, the following six commonly recognized elements should be fulfilled: (1) The existence of acts (by a nonstate actor or a third state) contrary to the rights of a victim state; (2) which are conducted from or through the territory of the potentially responsible state (or from or through the territory or cyber infrastructure under its control); (3) which would have been unlawful if conducted by the potentially responsible state; (4) which have serious adverse consequences for the victim state; (5) with respect to which the potentially responsible state has actual or constructive knowledge; and (6) upon which the potentially responsible state can act, but fails to take all feasible measures.⁴⁰\nAmong them, the third element on the unlawfulness test deserves a separate note, especially under the backdrop of a recently appeared expansionist view. According to such a view, territorial state is imputable for certain malicious cyber operations, even though they cannot unquestionably be categorized as internationally wrongful acts for lack of clear primary rules in international law. Combatting ransomware is one such example. Traditionally, ransomware attack is understood as cybercrime, attributable only to private bodies. As cybercrime can easily cross multiple borders, to effectively combat ransomware highly depends on international coordination of law enforcement, but the failure of which should not lead to liability of the territorial state.\nRecent development has overthrown this legal setting when, since the first half year of 2021, an intensive series of ransomware attacks hit the infrastructure and livelihood business worldwide and especially the US. In particular, President Biden publicly alleged that “Russia has some responsibility to deal with this.”⁴¹ After a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on June 16, 2021, he escalated that rhetoric: “Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory.”⁴² Some commentators have taken an even more proactive stance. They suggested that as a due diligence obligation, Russia is responsible to curb ransomware gangs in its territory, otherwise the US can legitimately adopt countermeasures including sanctions or military cyber operations.⁴³ This signals a disturbing tendency to inappropriately broaden territorial state’s international obligation, for activities that happened inside its border that are harmful to another state, even when those activities would have not been unlawful if conducted by that territorial state.\n³⁹ The Group of Governmental Experts, Report on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n⁴⁰ See CCDCOE Cyberlaw Wiki, Due diligence. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Due_diligence.\n⁴¹ Remarks by President Biden on the Economy (2021).\n⁴² Remarks by President Biden in Press Conference (2021).\n⁴³ Harding et al. (2021); Goldsmith (2021). Note there are also other viewpoints justifying the US combating ransomware group in Russian territory as “self-help,” instead of as countermeasure as to Russia’s breach of due diligence obligation. See Corn (2021).\nF. Yang\nTurning to the minority approach of due diligence as an attribution rule, the identification of the actual author shifts to that of state territory where those operations originate. According to such “indirect” or “imputed” attribution, a state is held responsible for the cyber malicious operations harming another state rather than for a breach of its due diligence obligation, provided that the act was launched from computer systems located on its territory, and it failed to take feasible measures against the act. As this unorthodox approach seems a bit excessive, it is no wonder the UN GGE specifically pointed out that “the indication that an ICT [information and communications technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from a state’s territory or from its ICT infrastructure may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.”\nIn light of these contending and confusing viewpoints, misusing and abusing “due diligence” to forge a legal logic to back up public attribution claims could facilitate ill-substantiation. It is thus important to reiterate the following points. First, “due diligence,” if imported to the cyber scenario, should be better understood as setting an obligation for a state rather than serving as a way to attribute. Second, the actual occurrence of a harmful cyber incident, which would have been unlawful if conducted by a potentially responsible state, is a prerequisite for the injured state to claim a due diligence violation. Third, even if state responsibility is successfully established along the legal path of due diligence, the responding measures that the accusing state might legitimately take should proportionately reflect the fact that the accused state did not conduct the malicious activities but, less harmfully, failed to address them with all feasible measures.\n## Evidentiary Requirements\nGeneral international law has not yet developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence. Key evidentiary issues such as burden and standard of proof are normally evaluated on an ad hoc basis. For cyber disputes, such ambiguity can be interpreted as a loophole that allows states to carry out malicious cyber operations hoping for no consequence; or it can also be interpreted as an opportunity that allows states to sometimes make public attributions “reasonably under the circumstances,” sometimes rather recklessly.\n Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, p 91.\n Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n Some commentator deems the evidentiary requirement in legal argument on cyber issues as a deadlock problem, which has no solution, so long as one sticks to an interventionist approach to impose international law on cyber operations. See d'Aspremont (2016).\n Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan BJ, op. cit. 22, p 177. Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\nOf those two evidentiary issues, burden of proof is less controversial. It is generally recognized that in \"a bilateral dispute over state responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant state.\"48 As a mechanism specifically tailored for cyber attribution, some proposed a shift of the burden of proof scheme, referred to as a \"virtual control\" test.49 The main argument behind this idea is that in cyber disputes, the territorial state for the alleged misbehavior has better access to the knowledge necessary to verify certain facts. By this mechanism, a prima facie responsibility would be established for the territorial state, unless it can provide evidence showing otherwise. It is not hard to imagine that this would probably cause more trouble than it intends to solve.50\nRegarding the standard of proof, a generally observed practice is that evidentiary standards should vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. Established ICJ cases also emphasized the importance to keep standard of proof transparent in the judgments. Through a comparative assessment of international litigation, one can identify a few recognizable levels of hierarchy on standards of proof, largely borrowed from the domestic legal system of common law countries.\nAs the highest level of requirement of standard of proof, \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" has its root in criminal cases and embodies the value of presumption of innocence. It requires a full chain of evidence, weighing together heavily toward one direction that forms a virtually indisputable claim. In international juridical forum, such standard is usually mandatory to substantiate a guilty verdict, as is made clear in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court regarding international criminal liability. The ICJ held in a few of its cases that, \"claims against a state involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive...same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\" Because a cyberattack amounts to an international crime with exceptional gravity, to substantiate its attribution should meet \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement.\nIn some cases, a preponderance of evidence is sufficient to support a legal claim. This lower level of requirement for the standard of proof concerns mainly the balance of probabilities of the two sides, which will favor the party with a more likely than not argument. In this regard, judges have vast discretionary power. As a result, extant\n48 ARSIWA, Commentaries, Chapter V, p 8.\n49 Margulies (2015).\n50 Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 93–97.\n51 Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.

Yang\ncases that adopt \"preponderance standard\" exclusively address territory issues, which rarely involve state responsibility.⁵⁵\nWith some room for debate, the ICJ cases and state practices support the “clear and convincing” standard for cases on use of force.⁵⁶ This requirement for the standard of proof lies in between preponderance and beyond-reasonable-doubt standard. As self-defense is a legitimate exception against prohibition of using force, to substantiate a self-defense case—in normal or cyber scenario—should also adopt the “clear and convincing” standard.⁵⁷ In other regular cases, the amount of certainty the ICJ generally requires seems also to be clear and convincing evidence by parties.⁵⁸ To prove a cyber attribution regarding use of force, the “clear and convincing” standard is applicable, since “reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.”⁵⁹\nTo sum up, the international legal practice, mainly reflected by the ICJ’s case law, so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation.⁶⁰ Based on this premise, the adequate default level of evidence for cyber public attribution should better be set around “clear and convincing” standard, with a sliding scale from “preponderance evidence” up to “proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Exactly which standard prevails should match the severity of the claim on a case-by-case basis. One potential choice is to argue that cyber attribution for self-defense requires “clear and convincing” standard, while, for lower countermeasure level, the preponderance standard would suffice. However, this should not become a strict legal test, due to the complexity of real-life cases.\nApart from the complex standard of proof debate, a safer bottom line for the evidentiary requirement could be drawn from general principle of procedural law: in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking.⁶¹ Especially in cyber attribution cases, this can be a proper guideline to counterbalance a convenient excuse of the accusing state to justify its selective disclosure of limited material in the name of prevention of divulging intelligence secrets. It is an important mechanism to bolster an attribution’s credibility by providing sufficient evidence to allow the accused state and other potential stakeholders to confirm or debunk.⁶²\n⁵⁵ The Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Saldavor/Honduras), ICJ Judgment of 11 September 1992, para. 248; Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Pateh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore), ICJ Judgment of 23 May 2008, para. 86.\n⁵⁶ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, while most cyber public attribution cases will not ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and nature of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, “Even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.” In the sense of facilitating customary law on evidentiary requirement, the formation of opinio juris may take some time, but it will never happen if the world is stuck to its current awkward status. The necessity and urgency are especially true for supporters of the “instant” international customary law.\nAnother opposing viewpoint is that it is hard to reconcile the evidentiary requirement on cyber attribution on one hand with the necessity to make a timely attribution on the other. This dilemma indeed exists. It should be subject to careful evaluation in a context-specific approach. Again, challenges in collecting and exhibiting evidence should not excuse evidence-less accusations.\n## Erroneous Attribution\nIf a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous—or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations—what legal consequences would the accusing state face? Underdevelopment of this legal issue will provide extra room for ill-substantiated public attribution, because no foreseeable punishment exists for irresponsible or erroneous allegations. However, current international law on this issue is tricky, not to mention that technical hurdles against a confident attribution in cyber brings extra complexity to this problem.\nTo begin with, it is safe to infer that, once the attribution proves to be based on false facts, the international wrongfulness of the subsequent self-defense or countermeasure adopted by the accusing state cannot be unquestionably eliminated. In other words, the accusing state may be held responsible for taking unjustified steps against the accused state. As a counterargument, the accusing state may propose that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith. Could claims of “reasonableness” and “honesty” exonerate its false judgment?\n Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 571–572.\n Bin Cheng first put forward the notion of \"instant\" international customary law in a discussion on outer space law. See Bin Cheng, United Nations Resolutions on Outer Space: ‘Instant’ International Customary Law? In: Bin Cheng (1997).\n Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 32.\n Milanovic (2020).\nF. Yang\nPositive view is echoed by some scholarly papers$^{67}$ as well as official statements.$^{68}$ For example, Tallinn Manuel 2.0 explicitly asserts:\nthe exercise of the right of self-defense... is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made *ex ante*, not *ex post facto*. Their reasonableness will be assessed based upon the information available at the time they were made, not in light of information that subsequently becomes available.$^{69}$\nOther commentators opine that with good faith or not, wrongful attribution in the first place will nonetheless make subsequent measures the fruit of a poisonous tree. The ILC holds such view in its commentary to Article 49(1) of ARSIWA.$^{70}$ If, during an *ex post* examination, the attribution tends to be wrongful because of errors in *ex ante* factual assessment, the mistaken state may be responsible whether its agents had acted in good faith or not.$^{71}$\nLast but not least, what if the accusing state makes a public attribution that later proves wrong, but it does not take, concrete measures? Although the accused state does not suffer from the responding measures, but the harm to its fame and reputation has been inflicted. Under such circumstances, should the accusing state be held partially responsible for the false attribution, sometimes intentionally? Would belittlement of this question encourage even more ill-substantiated public attribution? This issue deserves more international discussion.\n## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution\nAgainst the challenges posed by ill-substantiated public attribution, tentative solutions should be sought as per the three dimensions analytical framework, with due consideration paid to technical, political, and legal dimensions, respectively. Contrary proposals have been made to establish a centralized international attribution mechanism,$^{72}$ and to keep the current system of decentralized public–private attributions working.$^{73}$ As this paper particularly takes the perspective of legal lens, an international norm on responsible state’s behavior in public attribution is thus proposed as a possible way forward.\nIn this regard, UN GGE has provided a sound basis by repeatedly emphasizing in its final reports that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts\n$^{67}$ Sklerov (2009).\n$^{68}$ The White House (2012).\n$^{69}$ Schmitt (2017b).\n$^{70}$ ARSIWA, Commentaries, art. 49(3).\n$^{71}$ Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 97–109.\n$^{72}$ Shany and Schmitt (2020).\n$^{73}$ Eichensehr (2019).\nbrought against states should be substantiated.” Righteous in its nature though, this norm only points out the need for accusations to be substantiated but fails to elaborate how. Vis-à-vis the legal deficiencies previously identified, and bearing in mind the law of diminishing marginal utility, a norm on responsible public attribution should embody the following points.\n### Starting with an Out-of-The-Box Thought\nPrivate consultation before making cyber attribution public does not involve an ill-substantiation problem, as it will be confined in a confidential environment. If this becomes a mandatory preliminary step, improvement could be expected, because such procedural mechanism has proved to be useful in cutting down interstate disputes in other fields of international law. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a noticeable example. According to the relevant WTO rules, disputes are initiated through a formal request for consultations, whereby the complaining member invites the member whose measures are being challenged to discuss the disputed matter in order to resolve it without recourse to further litigation. Such consultation is mandatory, confidential, and with a time limit. If a similar mechanism exists in cyber conflict, the accusing state has a great chance to first consult privately with the accused state, channeling its interest demands without forcing the latter into an awkward position.\n### On Attribution Criteria\nState should refrain from removing key elements from due diligence rule to expand the coverage of another state's responsibility scope. Against the urgent need to cope with seriously damaging cybercrimes as ransomware, it may be too rash to argue straightforward for the existence of due diligence obligation to counter, in spite of no primary rule on such behavior. To better balance the position of the disputing states, and to better meet the challenge from ransomware and the like, it may be desirable to envisage a burden to investigate assumed by the accused state, provided that the accusing state can support its claim with satisfied evidence.\nOn Evidentiary Requirement\nThe standards of proof should be set in principle by the “clear and convincing” test, and shall increase as the seriousness of the accusation enhances. It is recommended that private channels be used to demonstrate early evidence. In this way, the accusing state is able to send a credible signal about its awareness and knowledge of the malicious operation, while the accused state has enough policy space—and face—to maneuver.\n### On Legal Consequence\nIt should be clear that the international wrongfulness of the responding measures taken by the accusing state cannot be justified by attribution wrongfully made on the basis of error in factual assessment. More ideally, states should act with good faith not making unsolidified accusations.\nA combined norm on attribution rule, evidentiary requirement, and legal consequence of erroneous attribution could be termed as. (1) A state cannot be held internationally legally responsible solely for an ICT activity launched or otherwise originates from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. (2) A state should substantiate its public attribution with adequate level evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a “clear and convincing” case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. (3) A state should refrain from taking responding measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making erroneous or falsified attribution.\n## Conclusion\nStrictly, the attribution under international law is but one of the two indispensable components in determining internationally wrongful acts, the other being the breach of an international obligation. A thorough discussion of attribution cannot do without addressing primary rules on cyber operations, either. This has been shown in previous analysis regarding due diligence. But still, the attribution discussion bears meaning, especially when it relates to some important legal deficiencies.\nRecent development is featured by the states beginning to favor public attribution as a policy tool. France consistently holds a cautious attitude toward public attribution, when it views naming an enemy, especially if it is a sovereign state, as a political act that requires highest level of decision. When France officially\n14 Pointing with Boneless Finger and Getting Away with it ...\nattributed a cyberattack for the first time, $^{78}$  in July 2021, it represents \"a subtle shift in the implementation of its attribution strategy.\" $^{79}$  China, the most frequent receiver of cyber public attributions, also made its first practice in 2021 through a private cyber security firm, claiming Indian source malicious cyber operations have been trying to infiltrate into sensitive zones within China's cyber domain. $^{80}$\nAgainst this backdrop, the expected marginal benefit from substantiated claims would greatly outweigh the marginal cost to substantiate the claim according to a set of commonly acceptable codes of conduct. A norm on responsible public attribution may be just on time to save the world from a chaotic blame game.\nAcknowledgements The author would extend the deepest appreciation to George Perkovich, Ariel Levite, Jon Bateman, Scott Collard, June Lee from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to Chuanying Lu, Manshu Xu from Shanghai Institute for International Studies, and to Yan Li from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, for their insightful critiques on earlier drafts of this Article."

Helpful in understanding such attribution practice are three commonly recognized dimensions, respectively, from technical, political, and legal perspectives. Compared to confidentially processed attribution, to publicly blame a state should be better substantiated. But as legal deficiencies in the current body of international law, apart from also some technical obstacles, cannot live up to the political desire of the accuser to make public attribution, the ill-substantiation problem becomes prominent. Debates over the\"control test\"and misuse of due diligence principle in cyber scenarios extend the responsibility scope of the territorial state. Lack of essential evidentiary requirements cripples the predictability and falsifiability for bringing up accusation. Inculpability for erroneous attribution invites the accusing state's recklessness. In light of these legal deficiencies, an international norm on responsible state behavior for public attribution could be a promising way forward.\nKeywords Ill-Substantiated public attribution $\\cdot$ Due diligence $\\cdot$ Evidentiary requirements $\\cdot$ Erroneous attribution $\\cdot$ Responsible state behavior This chapter is a fully revised and expanded article developed with permission from the author's earlier contribution to a research report on Managing U.S.-China Tensions Over Public Cyber Attribution, published by Carnegie Peaceful Endowment in March 2022.

Yang # Introduction The history for states to publicly attribute malicious cyber operations to an alleged accused is not long.¹ Although being the most frequent user of such policy tool, the US government's debut only came in 2014, when five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were indicted in a district court in the US, for hacking American companies for intellectual property.² A more prominent example is the denunciation made by the Biden Administration in 2021,³ also echoed by some of its allies,⁴ over China's Ministry of State Security for maintaining a network of criminal contract hackers responsible for the Microsoft Exchange Server attack that affected large group of worldwide users.\nNo wonder, after a state—either its governmental system or private businesses therein—suffers from malicious cyber operations by a foreign actor, it is tempting to identify and hold publicly accountable whoever it believes is responsible for that misbehavior. With an intention to deter malice and encourage order, such self-help effort can seemingly be of value to an underregulated cyberspace.\nWhen cyberspace just began to show its impact on international affairs, it was once a common fear that, with its unique architecture and operational process,\"the Internet is perfect for plausible deniability.\"⁵ The recent tide of public attribution—especially ill-substantiated ones among them—is no panacea against such fear, but rather seems to be a hypercorrection. For the international society, neither direction is satisfactory. The ultimate question to ask should then be: how to strike a balance between these conflicting interests, so that the bad agents in cyberspace cannot easily escape from penalty, while reckless public accusation also comes with a nonnegligible consequence.\n¹ To clarify, this Article uses the term\"cyber operation\"to incorporate different categories of cyber activities, including cyberattack which may amount to a use of force or armed attack in the sense of international law, and cyber espionage which refers to the large variety of below the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) activities in cyber\"grey zone,\"and also cyber-criminal activities, which does not trigger state responsibility in the strict and traditional sense, but may be changing in the cyber scenario.\nOn another note, this Article focuses on public attribution made by states. Entities other than states can also publicly attribute blame for a cyber operation, but for different aims and subject to different rules, if any. Private corporations, usually cyber security firms, may aim to enhance their influence, cultivate market demands, and ultimately cash out by selling products, services, and solutions on cybersecurity. Media may simply want an eye-catching story and may be easily manipulated by customized feeds of source information provided by enterprises or state organs. Since it falls outside of the purview of international law, the problem with these entities making public attribution merits a separate piece of analysis.\n² Dong et al. (2014). Some commentator coined this as\"attribution by indictment,\"see Keitner (2019).\n³ The White House (2021).\n⁴ Among them are the EU, NATO, and UK. See, e.g., Council of the EU (2021, UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, National Cyber Security Centre, and The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP (2021), NATO (2021).\n⁵ Brenner (2009).\n\nFor the latter part of the query, this article would propose that public attribution requires a timely calibration especially from the legal viewpoint. Otherwise, it may incur extra problem, as any accuser naturally tends to point fingers rather recklessly if no effective curb exists. To illustrate, Sect. 14.2 will usher in a widely used analytical framework to dissect cyber public attribution process, point out the ill-substantiation problem, and demonstrate its destabilizing nature. Section 14.3 will focus on three types of legal deficiencies in extant international law that enable and encourage ill-substantiated public attribution. Section 14.4 will then propose the norm on responsible public attribution as a possible way forward.\n## The Problem with Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution ## Three-Dimension Framework to Interrogate Public Attribution The effort of cyber public attribution entails three generally recognized considerations, which stem from technical, political, and legal perspectives, respectively.⁶ First, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and restore the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is in large part a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber operation back to a machine or a location. Yet, pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires corroboration from human intelligence as well. It goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law.\nAlthough for tech experts like Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of a cyber security firm Crowdstrike, “identifying who is responsible … is now largely a solved problem,”⁷ states’ capabilities to associate an attack with a responsible party through technical means are far from evenly distributed.⁸ Asymmetric pattern of attribution practice can thus be deduced from such technical impurity, as the capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.⁹ Second, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decision to ⁶ For pioneering work to review the exercise of “matching an offender to an offence … in minimizing uncertainty” on tactical, operational, and strategical levels. See Rid and Buchanan (2015).\n⁷ Alperovitch (2018).\n⁸ The impurity of cyber capabilities among states, including that to attribute, has been assessed and largely validated by many empirical studies. For one example, see The International Institute for Strategic Studies (2021).\n⁹ For chart illustrations covering the period of 2015–2020 verifying this deduction, see Garrett Derian-Toth et al. (2021). Not surprisingly, top five countries that made the most use of public attributions are all from Five Eyes Alliance, and China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been identified as the responsible actors for 75% of all state-sponsored offensive cyber operations.\nmake, such as whether, when and in what form to publicly hold the actor accountable, or whether to call for coordinated actions from allies. As has been righteously noted, this political decision making is “a highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.” The accusing state may be influenced by a complex matrix of political intentions, including, inter alia: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms.\nCompatible with this complexity, different forms of public attributions have also been developed for different case scenarios. The US, for example, can make public cyber attribution by indicting foreign criminal, imposing economic sanctions, sending out technical alerts, and issuing official statements or press releases. To sum up, a state's decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.\nThird, from a legal perspective, public attribution means imputation by connecting the offense to an offender according to applicable rules, either domestic or international. For purpose of this chapter, domestic imputation—such as indictment against foreign individuals—is left undiscussed; specific focus is put on cases intending to establish state responsibility as per applicable international law. Within this limit, legal attribution also serves as a basis to legitimize future responding measures, such as self-defense or other forms of countermeasures the accusing state may take, depending on the nature and severity of the original malicious cyber operations. Ideally, the international legal system should provide clear guidance regarding rules for attribution. However, the current body of international law is seriously inadequate on this issue, which, as will be explained, is the very root of the problem.\nIt's worthy to note that states may still publicly accuse others of conducting unwanted cyber operations regardless of any clear legal basis for doing so. For example, the US officially holds that political attribution in the form of official announcements does not require meeting any legal standards in the strict sense. This well reflects the complexity embedded within public attribution practice as to its diversified form and purpose.\n\n## Substantiation as the Problem\nCompared to attribution that is confidentially processed and privately communicated, it is only logical that public attribution should be better supported. Conversely, however, public attribution is particularly susceptible to the problem of ill-substantiation, if not the absence of substantiation at all. The fundamental cause is that—to use the language of the three dimensions analytical framework—the political desire to publicly blame adversary state cannot be properly checked and balanced, due to technical impurity and the lack of legal restraints. Under strong political impetus to publicly blame the accused state, the technically capable state seems to enjoy taking advantage of the lawless status quo.\nThe term “ill-substantiated public attribution” is thereby specifically coined. It refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assigns responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. This problem lies in moving scale, rather than a simple yes-or-no judgment. As regards this concept, three illustrating points are necessary.\nFirst, the appropriate level of substantiation should match the purpose and form of public attribution.¹⁸ Take an extreme case as example. Here, a state is held publicly responsible for carrying out cyber operations that amount to an armed attack,¹⁹ activating the victim state’s right to self-defense. Obviously, such a claim is subject to challenge unless it can be unequivocally supported.²⁰ Another comparable situation occurs when there is a breach of general international legal obligation of non-intervention, and the accusing state aims to establish responsibility that can justify its future countermeasures. The requirement to prove this latter claim should be appropriately downsized.\nSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among two opposite camps of states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated.²¹ The US and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can thereby “act reasonably under the circumstances.”²² The most updated result of such contention is reflected in the 2021 report of the UN GGE, when it emphasized again that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful\n¹⁸ Some have noted that different purposes of public attribution relate to different levels of evidence. See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, p 558.\n¹⁹ It is a long-debated question as to when does cyber operations fall within the meaning of “armed attack” in the language of Art. 51 of UN Charter. See, e.g., Dev (2015).\n²⁰ Finlay and Payne (2019).\n²¹ China, Russia, et al. (2018).\n²² Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan (2017). Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\nacts brought against states should be substantiated.” The connotation that only verified accusation stands is clear, but the \"how\" question remains untouched.\nThird, ill-substantiated public attribution problem should be addressed in marginal sense rather than in average or absolute sense. Solid substantiation brings positive yield, which helps to produce long-term credibility and stability. But it also means cost. The author tends not to go extreme on the requirement of substantiation, paying no attention to the constraint condition of cost. Against this backdrop, the law of diminishing marginal utility instructs that the logical deduction to stop is the point where marginal cost for extra substantiation cannot be covered by the added yield it may bring. As per this logic, the most productive phase in terms of legalization is exactly when the world moves from the lawless status quo to a more disciplined and transparent regime of public attribution.\n### Destabilizing Nature of Reckless Accusation\nAlthough public attribution per se will not necessarily pose a problem, the ill-substantiated public attribution is unhelpful in securing the political pursuits of the accusing state, as has been previously listed.\nPublic attribution is often justified as a policy tool to ease domestic pressure to react against a foreign malicious cyber operation. By telling a falsified or incomplete story, an ill-substantiated—and thus unhealthy—public attribution tends to exaggerate the efficiency and the fierceness of the authority, but seldom with satisfying answer from those crucified. This may breed populism, which will in turn squeeze the policy space.\nCritiques on the credibleness of cyber deterrence often builds on the observation that cyber attribution is difficult and manageable from the side of a hidden attacker. Making ill-substantiated public attribution would only worsen this situation, because reckless accusation is insufficient to legitimize possible responding measures from the deterring state, and therefore is a cheap form of signaling in the eyes of a potential adversary. By the same token, naming and shaming are unlikely to work as previously anticipated by the accusing state, because reckless finger-pointing may be interpreted as slandering and defamation.\nIn some cases, a state pursues to exert more deterring influence by bringing its ally to form a collective attribution. To clarify, a mere increase in the number of the accusing side is probably useful in making a fuss, but it will not enhance the legitimacy of an attribution. For each claim to stand, the robustness of the legal logic and the completeness of the evidence still play a decisive role.\nIll-substantiated public attribution contributes little—if not brings outright detriment—to norm-building, as it relies on the incompleteness of applicable rules. When a state deems itself in an advantageous position in the game of accusing\n\n## Legal Deficiencies that Enable Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution\nAs mentioned, international law serves as the basis to impute the accused state in relation to malicious cyber operations. State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law.²⁶ Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution.\nThe deficiencies are threefold: (1) international rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios; (2) international legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular; and (3) legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attribution are not clearly defined.\n## Attribution Rules\nGeneral international law recognizes that attribution rules have been compiled in International Law Commission’s draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), particularly Articles 4 through 11. ARSIWA was adopted by the UN General Assembly,²⁷ and is considered by both courts and commentators to be a fine codification of customary international law.²⁸ Linking state organs’ activity to that state as per ARSIWA proves to be less troublesome. But when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors, to ascribe the agency to a state agent is no easy task. Unfortunately, most of the cyber attributions are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate\n²⁶ Art. 2 of ARSIWA.\n²⁷ (28 Jan 2002) General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, UN Doc (A/RES/56/83). https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/56/83.\n²⁸ Crawford (2013).\nF. Yang\nactor's behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial. Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.\nRegarding the legal standard of the level of control required for attribution to occur, two generally recognized approaches[29] are the \"effective control\" test devised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,[30] and the \"overall control\" test developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Tadic decision.[31] Some argue that the \"overall control\" test should prevail in scenarios of cyber attribution, because the \"effective control\" test is far stricter and thus may function as \"a free pass to state sponsorship of cyberattacks.\"[32]\nThis proposal is far from a suitable solution for two reasons.[33] First, both of the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the nonstate actor, so that they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control. Second, the \"overall control\" standard was explicitly confined to \"organized and hierarchically structured groups\" such as military or paramilitary units,[34] while, as a matter of juridical fact, the stricter \"effective control\" test has been upheld in determining attribution concerning the acts of individuals or non-organized groups.\nConsidering how difficult it is to persuasively demonstrate that a state is effectively or generally controlling a nonstate entity, an alternative would be to hold states responsible for regulating or preventing unauthorized persons or groups from conducting malicious cyber operations within their jurisdictions. This potentially more qualified candidate of attribution rules is captured by the proposal to extend the application of \"due diligence\" in a cyber scenario. Due diligence is a notion first recognized by the ICJ in Corfu Channel.[35] Academic viewpoints among international lawyers are rather unanimous to import due diligence to cyber context, but are competing to categorize it as a primary rule of international obligation over state conduct,[36] or as a secondary rule to determine violation.[37]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare defines due diligence as a substantive obligation[38]; the United Nations Group of Government Experts (UN GEE) report endorses this approach with similar\n[29] Ibid, pp 146–154.\n[30] Case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA), Merits, (27 Jun 1986) ICJ Report.\n[31] Prosecutor v. Tadic, Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 Oct 1995) (ICTY-94-1-AR72).\n[32] Shackleford and Andres (2010).\n[33] Lahmann (2020).\n[34] Prosecutor v. Tadic, paras. 131, 137.\n[35] The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Merits, ICJ Report, 1949.\n[36] Shackelford et al. (2016), Jensen and Watts (2021).\n[37] Mackenzie and Scott (2021), Chircop (2018).\n[38] Schmitt (2017a), Rule 6. The rule reads: \"State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other states.\"\n\nwording.³⁹ Per this understanding, the original task of attributing malicious cyber operations to a territorial state no longer requires an answer. A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, the following six commonly recognized elements should be fulfilled: (1) The existence of acts (by a nonstate actor or a third state) contrary to the rights of a victim state; (2) which are conducted from or through the territory of the potentially responsible state (or from or through the territory or cyber infrastructure under its control); (3) which would have been unlawful if conducted by the potentially responsible state; (4) which have serious adverse consequences for the victim state; (5) with respect to which the potentially responsible state has actual or constructive knowledge; and (6) upon which the potentially responsible state can act, but fails to take all feasible measures.⁴⁰ Among them, the third element on the unlawfulness test deserves a separate note, especially under the backdrop of a recently appeared expansionist view. According to such a view, territorial state is imputable for certain malicious cyber operations, even though they cannot unquestionably be categorized as internationally wrongful acts for lack of clear primary rules in international law. Combatting ransomware is one such example. Traditionally, ransomware attack is understood as cybercrime, attributable only to private bodies. As cybercrime can easily cross multiple borders, to effectively combat ransomware highly depends on international coordination of law enforcement, but the failure of which should not lead to liability of the territorial state.\nRecent development has overthrown this legal setting when, since the first half year of 2021, an intensive series of ransomware attacks hit the infrastructure and livelihood business worldwide and especially the US. In particular, President Biden publicly alleged that “Russia has some responsibility to deal with this.”⁴¹ After a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on June 16, 2021, he escalated that rhetoric: “Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory.”⁴² Some commentators have taken an even more proactive stance. They suggested that as a due diligence obligation, Russia is responsible to curb ransomware gangs in its territory, otherwise the US can legitimately adopt countermeasures including sanctions or military cyber operations.⁴³ This signals a disturbing tendency to inappropriately broaden territorial state’s international obligation, for activities that happened inside its border that are harmful to another state, even when those activities would have not been unlawful if conducted by that territorial state.\n³⁹ The Group of Governmental Experts, Report on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n⁴⁰ See CCDCOE Cyberlaw Wiki, Due diligence. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Due_diligence.\n⁴¹ Remarks by President Biden on the Economy (2021).\n⁴² Remarks by President Biden in Press Conference (2021).\n⁴³ Harding et al. (2021); Goldsmith (2021). Note there are also other viewpoints justifying the US combating ransomware group in Russian territory as “self-help,” instead of as countermeasure as to Russia’s breach of due diligence obligation. See Corn (2021).\nF. Yang Turning to the minority approach of due diligence as an attribution rule, the identification of the actual author shifts to that of state territory where those operations originate. According to such “indirect” or “imputed” attribution,[44] a state is held responsible for the cyber malicious operations harming another state rather than for a breach of its due diligence obligation, provided that the act was launched from computer systems located on its territory, and it failed to take feasible measures against the act. As this unorthodox approach seems a bit excessive, it is no wonder the UN GGE specifically pointed out that “the indication that an ICT [information and communications technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from a state’s territory or from its ICT infrastructure may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.”[45] In light of these contending and confusing viewpoints, misusing and abusing “due diligence” to forge a legal logic to back up public attribution claims could facilitate ill-substantiation. It is thus important to reiterate the following points. First, “due diligence,” if imported to the cyber scenario, should be better understood as setting an obligation for a state rather than serving as a way to attribute. Second, the actual occurrence of a harmful cyber incident, which would have been unlawful if conducted by a potentially responsible state, is a prerequisite for the injured state to claim a due diligence violation. Third, even if state responsibility is successfully established along the legal path of due diligence, the responding measures that the accusing state might legitimately take should proportionately reflect the fact that the accused state did not conduct the malicious activities but, less harmfully, failed to address them with all feasible measures.\n## Evidentiary Requirements[46] General international law has not yet developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence. Key evidentiary issues such as burden and standard of proof are normally evaluated on an ad hoc basis. For cyber disputes, such ambiguity can be interpreted as a loophole that allows states to carry out malicious cyber operations hoping for no consequence; or it can also be interpreted as an opportunity that allows states to sometimes make public attributions “reasonably under the circumstances,”[47] sometimes rather recklessly.\n[44] Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, p 91.\n[45] Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (Advanced Copy) (2021).\n[46] Some commentator deems the evidentiary requirement in legal argument on cyber issues as a deadlock problem, which has no solution, so long as one sticks to an interventionist approach to impose international law on cyber operations. See d'Aspremont (2016).\n[47] Quoted phrase appeared in the first statement of the US position on evidentiary issues, see Egan BJ, op. cit. 22, p 177. Regarding legal underpinnings of evidentiary issues in cyber attribution, “the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution” have been criticized as “shortsighted.” See Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 521–598.\n\nOf those two evidentiary issues, burden of proof is less controversial. It is generally recognized that in\"a bilateral dispute over state responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant state.\"48 As a mechanism specifically tailored for cyber attribution, some proposed a shift of the burden of proof scheme, referred to as a\"virtual control\"test.49 The main argument behind this idea is that in cyber disputes, the territorial state for the alleged misbehavior has better access to the knowledge necessary to verify certain facts. By this mechanism, a prima facie responsibility would be established for the territorial state, unless it can provide evidence showing otherwise. It is not hard to imagine that this would probably cause more trouble than it intends to solve.50 Regarding the standard of proof, a generally observed practice is that evidentiary standards should vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. Established ICJ cases also emphasized the importance to keep standard of proof transparent in the judgments.[51] Through a comparative assessment of international litigation, one can identify a few recognizable levels of hierarchy on standards of proof, largely borrowed from the domestic legal system of common law countries.[52] As the highest level of requirement of standard of proof,\"proof beyond reasonable doubt\"has its root in criminal cases and embodies the value of presumption of innocence. It requires a full chain of evidence, weighing together heavily toward one direction that forms a virtually indisputable claim. In international juridical forum, such standard is usually mandatory to substantiate a guilty verdict, as is made clear in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court regarding international criminal liability.[53] The ICJ held in a few of its cases that,\"claims against a state involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive...same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\"[54] Because a cyberattack amounts to an international crime with exceptional gravity, to substantiate its attribution should meet\"proof beyond reasonable doubt\"requirement.\nIn some cases, a preponderance of evidence is sufficient to support a legal claim. This lower level of requirement for the standard of proof concerns mainly the balance of probabilities of the two sides, which will favor the party with a more likely than not argument. In this regard, judges have vast discretionary power. As a result, extant F. Yang cases that adopt\"preponderance standard\"exclusively address territory issues, which rarely involve state responsibility.⁵⁵ With some room for debate, the ICJ cases and state practices support the “clear and convincing” standard for cases on use of force.⁵⁶ This requirement for the standard of proof lies in between preponderance and beyond-reasonable-doubt standard. As self-defense is a legitimate exception against prohibition of using force, to substantiate a self-defense case—in normal or cyber scenario—should also adopt the “clear and convincing” standard.⁵⁷ In other regular cases, the amount of certainty the ICJ generally requires seems also to be clear and convincing evidence by parties.⁵⁸ To prove a cyber attribution regarding use of force, the “clear and convincing” standard is applicable, since “reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.”⁵⁹ To sum up, the international legal practice, mainly reflected by the ICJ’s case law, so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation.⁶⁰ Based on this premise, the adequate default level of evidence for cyber public attribution should better be set around “clear and convincing” standard, with a sliding scale from “preponderance evidence” up to “proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Exactly which standard prevails should match the severity of the claim on a case-by-case basis. One potential choice is to argue that cyber attribution for self-defense requires “clear and convincing” standard, while, for lower countermeasure level, the preponderance standard would suffice. However, this should not become a strict legal test, due to the complexity of real-life cases.\nApart from the complex standard of proof debate, a safer bottom line for the evidentiary requirement could be drawn from general principle of procedural law: in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking.⁶¹ Especially in cyber attribution cases, this can be a proper guideline to counterbalance a convenient excuse of the accusing state to justify its selective disclosure of limited material in the name of prevention of divulging intelligence secrets. It is an important mechanism to bolster an attribution’s credibility by providing sufficient evidence to allow the accused state and other potential stakeholders to confirm or debunk.⁶² ⁵⁵ The Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Saldavor/Honduras), ICJ Judgment of 11 September 1992, para. 248; Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Pateh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore), ICJ Judgment of 23 May 2008, para. 86.\n⁵⁶ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Uganda), ICJ Judgment of 2005, ICJ Reports (2005), paras. 72, 91, 136.\n⁵⁷ O’Connell (2002); Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 559–562.\n⁵⁸ Teitelbaum (2007).\n⁵⁹ See Schmitt (2011).\n⁶⁰ Brunner et al. (2019).\n⁶¹ Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 576–586.\n⁶² Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 28.\n\nSome may disfavor the above discussion on setting an evidentiary standard. They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, while most cyber public attribution cases will not ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and nature of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, “Even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.”[63] In the sense of facilitating customary law on evidentiary requirement, the formation of opinio juris may take some time, but it will never happen if the world is stuck to its current awkward status. The necessity and urgency are especially true for supporters of the “instant” international customary law.[64] Another opposing viewpoint is that it is hard to reconcile the evidentiary requirement on cyber attribution on one hand with the necessity to make a timely attribution on the other.[65] This dilemma indeed exists. It should be subject to careful evaluation in a context-specific approach. Again, challenges in collecting and exhibiting evidence should not excuse evidence-less accusations.\n## Erroneous Attribution If a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous—or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations—what legal consequences would the accusing state face? Underdevelopment of this legal issue will provide extra room for ill-substantiated public attribution, because no foreseeable punishment exists for irresponsible or erroneous allegations. However, current international law on this issue is tricky,[66] not to mention that technical hurdles against a confident attribution in cyber brings extra complexity to this problem.\nTo begin with, it is safe to infer that, once the attribution proves to be based on false facts, the international wrongfulness of the subsequent self-defense or countermeasure adopted by the accusing state cannot be unquestionably eliminated. In other words, the accusing state may be held responsible for taking unjustified steps against the accused state. As a counterargument, the accusing state may propose that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith. Could claims of “reasonableness” and “honesty” exonerate its false judgment?\n[63] Eichensehr K, op. cit. 15, pp 571–572.\n[64] Bin Cheng first put forward the notion of\"instant\"international customary law in a discussion on outer space law. See Bin Cheng, United Nations Resolutions on Outer Space: ‘Instant’ International Customary Law? In: Bin Cheng (1997).\n[65] Rid T, Buchanan B, op. cit. 6, p 32.\n[66] Milanovic (2020).\nF. Yang Positive view is echoed by some scholarly papers as well as official statements. For example, Tallinn Manuel 2.0 explicitly asserts: the exercise of the right of self-defense... is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made *ex ante*, not *ex post facto*. Their reasonableness will be assessed based upon the information available at the time they were made, not in light of information that subsequently becomes available.\nOther commentators opine that with good faith or not, wrongful attribution in the first place will nonetheless make subsequent measures the fruit of a poisonous tree. The ILC holds such view in its commentary to Article 49(1) of ARSIWA. If, during an *ex post* examination, the attribution tends to be wrongful because of errors in *ex ante* factual assessment, the mistaken state may be responsible whether its agents had acted in good faith or not.\nLast but not least, what if the accusing state makes a public attribution that later proves wrong, but it does not take, concrete measures? Although the accused state does not suffer from the responding measures, but the harm to its fame and reputation has been inflicted. Under such circumstances, should the accusing state be held partially responsible for the false attribution, sometimes intentionally? Would belittlement of this question encourage even more ill-substantiated public attribution? This issue deserves more international discussion.\n## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution Against the challenges posed by ill-substantiated public attribution, tentative solutions should be sought as per the three dimensions analytical framework, with due consideration paid to technical, political, and legal dimensions, respectively. Contrary proposals have been made to establish a centralized international attribution mechanism, and to keep the current system of decentralized public–private attributions working. As this paper particularly takes the perspective of legal lens, an international norm on responsible state’s behavior in public attribution is thus proposed as a possible way forward.\nIn this regard, UN GGE has provided a sound basis by repeatedly emphasizing in its final reports that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts Sklerov (2009).\n The White House (2012).\n Schmitt (2017b).\n ARSIWA, Commentaries, art. 49(3).\n Lahmann H, op. cit. 33, pp 97–109.\n Shany and Schmitt (2020).\n Eichensehr (2019).\nbrought against states should be substantiated.” Righteous in its nature though, this norm only points out the need for accusations to be substantiated but fails to elaborate how. Vis-à-vis the legal deficiencies previously identified, and bearing in mind the law of diminishing marginal utility, a norm on responsible public attribution should embody the following points.\n### Starting with an Out-of-The-Box Thought Private consultation before making cyber attribution public does not involve an ill-substantiation problem, as it will be confined in a confidential environment. If this becomes a mandatory preliminary step, improvement could be expected, because such procedural mechanism has proved to be useful in cutting down interstate disputes in other fields of international law. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a noticeable example. According to the relevant WTO rules, disputes are initiated through a formal request for consultations, whereby the complaining member invites the member whose measures are being challenged to discuss the disputed matter in order to resolve it without recourse to further litigation. Such consultation is mandatory, confidential, and with a time limit. If a similar mechanism exists in cyber conflict, the accusing state has a great chance to first consult privately with the accused state, channeling its interest demands without forcing the latter into an awkward position.\n### On Attribution Criteria State should refrain from removing key elements from due diligence rule to expand the coverage of another state's responsibility scope. Against the urgent need to cope with seriously damaging cybercrimes as ransomware, it may be too rash to argue straightforward for the existence of due diligence obligation to counter, in spite of no primary rule on such behavior. To better balance the position of the disputing states, and to better meet the challenge from ransomware and the like, it may be desirable to envisage a burden to investigate assumed by the accused state, provided that the accusing state can support its claim with satisfied evidence.\nOn Evidentiary Requirement The standards of proof should be set in principle by the “clear and convincing” test, and shall increase as the seriousness of the accusation enhances. It is recommended that private channels be used to demonstrate early evidence. In this way, the accusing state is able to send a credible signal about its awareness and knowledge of the malicious operation, while the accused state has enough policy space—and face—to maneuver.\n### On Legal Consequence It should be clear that the international wrongfulness of the responding measures taken by the accusing state cannot be justified by attribution wrongfully made on the basis of error in factual assessment. More ideally, states should act with good faith not making unsolidified accusations.\nA combined norm on attribution rule, evidentiary requirement, and legal consequence of erroneous attribution could be termed as. (1) A state cannot be held internationally legally responsible solely for an ICT activity launched or otherwise originates from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. (2) A state should substantiate its public attribution with adequate level evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a “clear and convincing” case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. (3) A state should refrain from taking responding measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making erroneous or falsified attribution.\n## Conclusion Strictly, the attribution under international law is but one of the two indispensable components in determining internationally wrongful acts, the other being the breach of an international obligation. A thorough discussion of attribution cannot do without addressing primary rules on cyber operations, either. This has been shown in previous analysis regarding due diligence. But still, the attribution discussion bears meaning, especially when it relates to some important legal deficiencies.\nRecent development is featured by the states beginning to favor public attribution as a policy tool. France consistently holds a cautious attitude toward public attribution, when it views naming an enemy, especially if it is a sovereign state, as a political act that requires highest level of decision. When France officially attributed a cyberattack for the first time, in July 2021, it represents\"a subtle shift in the implementation of its attribution strategy.\"China, the most frequent receiver of cyber public attributions, also made its first practice in 2021 through a private cyber security firm, claiming Indian source malicious cyber operations have been trying to infiltrate into sensitive zones within China's cyber domain. \nAgainst this backdrop, the expected marginal benefit from substantiated claims would greatly outweigh the marginal cost to substantiate the claim according to a set of commonly acceptable codes of conduct. A norm on responsible public attribution may be just on time to save the world from a chaotic blame game.\nAcknowledgements The author would extend the deepest appreciation to George Perkovich, Ariel Levite, Jon Bateman, Scott Collard, June Lee from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to Chuanying Lu, Manshu Xu from Shanghai Institute for International Studies, and to Yan Li from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, for their insightful critiques on earlier drafts of this Article."

Helpful in understanding such attribution practice are three commonly recognized dimensions, respectively, from technical, political, and legal perspectives. Compared to confidentially processed attribution, to publicly blame a state should be better substantiated. But as legal deficiencies in the current body of international law, apart from also some technical obstacles, cannot live up to the political desire of the accuser to make public attribution, the ill-substantiation problem becomes prominent. Debates over the \"control test\" and misuse of due diligence principle in cyber scenarios extend the responsibility scope of the territorial state. Lack of essential evidentiary requirements cripples the predictability and falsifiability for bringing up accusation. Inculpability for erroneous attribution invites the accusing state's recklessness. In light of these legal deficiencies, an international norm on responsible state behavior for public attribution could be a promising way forward.",
