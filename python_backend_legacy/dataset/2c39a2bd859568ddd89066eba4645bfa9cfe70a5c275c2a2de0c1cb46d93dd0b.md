It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself. From a more technical point of view, this is scarcely true because in its modern meaning \"neutrality\" is a legal status involving certain rights and duties. It therefore contemplates the existence of some sort of international legal system.¹\n# I. INTRODUCTION\nUnlike the physical domains of land, sea, air, and outer space, the new man-made domain of cyberspace cannot be seen or felt for it \"is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time-space continuum.\"² Since its creation by man, cyberspace has greatly expanded the interconnectivity of the world. \"Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light.\"³ It has led to advancements in all areas of life. At the same time, however, cyberspace creates great new vulnerabilities, which have the potential to disrupt peace and stability in the world.⁴\nAlthough cyberspace has existed for the last several decades, there are still no international rules, much less standard definitions applicable to this new domain.⁵ Utilizing cyber operations or\n* CDR Danielle Higson is the Director of the Cyber, Information Operations, and Intelligence Law Division of the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.”¹⁴ “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”¹⁵ Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.”¹⁶ At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons.¹⁷ Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare.¹⁸ “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.”¹⁹ This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.²⁰\n¹⁴ John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

In a situation where the “use of force” amounts to an “armed attack,” Article 51 allows a State to legally respond in self-defense with force. See U.N. Charter art. 51. If the State responds with force against the other State, there will be an international armed conflict as referred to in Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions and a state of war as referred to in the Hague Conventions.

However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated.²¹ The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful.²² In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations.²³ Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it.²⁴ Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.”²⁵ While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status.²⁶ A misguided view of the law of\n²¹ See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality. Part VI wraps up analyzing how States did not lose neutral status by assisting Georgia in 2008 during its cyber crisis. Before looking at how sovereignty and the law of neutrality apply in cyberspace, it is important to understand the structure and value of the Internet.\n## II. THE CENTERPIECE OF CYBERSPACE – THE INTERNET\n“The Net negates geometry. While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.”³⁴ It is not a definable or describable place. Yet, one can find things within the Internet that one did not know existed nor where they were located.³⁵ “The Net is ambient – nowhere in particular but everywhere at once.”³⁶ One can access the Internet by logging on from wherever one is physically located,³⁷ placing oneself virtually in cyberspace while simultaneously remaining in the territorial sovereign of where one began the journey. While virtually exploring cyberspace, one seamlessly transcends into and across the cyberspace of other States. These unique characteristics pose a challenge for sovereignty. Although the Internet is only a subset of cyberspace, this paper primarily concentrates on the Internet in exploring how to create a regime for sovereignty in cyberspace. This section examines the characteristics of the Internet that will impact the choice of a regime.\n## A. The Birth of the Internet\nIn the interest of National Security, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) provided the funding and institutional support for the research that led to the development of the Internet.³⁸ Despite DoD’s motives, the aspirations and vision of a unique group of electrical engineers and unorthodox computer programmers, who desired to redesign the way computers worked in order to amplify human thinking and communication, designed the Internet.³⁹ Desiring to keep the Inter-\n³⁴ WILLIAM J.

C. R. Licklider, a psychologist at MIT, headed the program.⁴³ The DoD created ARPA with a broad mandate to fund cutting-edge research and strategically placed the Agency directly below the Secretary of Defense.⁴⁴ “Throughout the 1960s groups at various universities and research centers were funded to work on different aspects of interactive computing and networking.”⁴⁵ First, the research focused on enabling users to interact with a computer through a terminal, which then turned to connecting computers in different geographic locations to enable them to collaborate and share materials.⁴⁶ In 1965, the researchers linked a computer in Massachusetts to one in California through a telephone network, but large blocks of data caused problems when they created traffic jams.⁴⁷ A packet-switching network, which “allows for faster travel speeds, a higher volume of information, and permits the system to withstand additional stresses,”⁴⁸ still utilized today, turned out to be the solution.⁴⁹\nIn the fall of 1969 at UCLA, the first computer network, ARPANET, was born.⁵⁰ It was deliberately designed with “a distributed, redundant structure so that it could survive partial nuclear destruction and the knockout of military headquarters.”⁵¹ By the end of that year, four host computers connected approximately one thousand researchers around the country.⁵² The network got bigger and bigger and was utilized more for sending messages than its original purpose of sharing expensive resources among the different research centers.⁵³ In 1975, the military became interested in the network and began using it for communication.⁵⁴ In 1982, the network was split into MILNET,\n⁴⁰ JACK GOLDSMITH &amp; TIM WU, WHO CONTROLS THE INTERNET?, ILLUSIONS OF BORDERLESS WORLD 23 (2006) (referring to the structure of the Internet’s design as open, minimalist, and neutral because it is willing to accept any time of computer or network to join, does not require much of the computers or networks to join, and treats all applications the same).\n⁴¹ Id.\n⁴² HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n⁴³ HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n⁴⁴ HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (commenting the design was to ensure the project would be independent of pressures from individual services for specific projects).\n⁴⁵ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (asserting that there was interest throughout the United States of people who were eager to reinvent computing).\n⁴⁶ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n⁴⁷ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n⁴⁸ See Sharon R.

The Backbone of the Internet\nThe Internet is a very large system of interconnected networks “with significant built-in capacity to resist concentrations of power and authoritarian control.”60 It is a packet-switching network, which distributes messages by breaking them up into smaller addressed packets that follow independent routes to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original message.61 Instead of a central control, independent routers ensure “the addressed packets flow around saturated channels.”62 Not only does this system provide improved efficiency, it provides a more secure system of communication.63 “If one node goes down, the network reroutes around it.”64 Depending on the demand at any given time, packets travel on the most efficient path, causing there to be no predictable paths of travel.65 There is also no way of prohibiting a packet from traveling on an open network of a particular State.66 One message, depending on size, can be divided up into multitude of packets, which all theoretically can travel on a different path through the cyberspace of different sovereign\n55 HANSON, supra note 38, at 59.\n56 George K Walker, Information Warfare and Neutrality, 33 VAND.

It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers . . . There is no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.⁷⁰\nA great deal of the functionality of the Internet is attributed to the end-to-end principle, which network architects, Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David Clark, used as their guiding principle in designing the Internet.⁷¹\nRather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network — to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network's core. The core is kept as simple as possible.⁷²\nSo any changes to the architecture of the Internet such as authentication or content filtering should not be done by changes to the network itself, but rather by applications attached to the network.⁷³\nThe backbone of the Internet being the packet-switching network and the common language of TCP/IP is essential to maintain the current interoperable Internet.⁷⁴ In the interest of cyber security, commercial and governmental organizations utilize firewalls to protect themselves from the evils lurking on the Internet.⁷⁵ These firewalls are applications that keep computers safe from some attacks and prevent some websites from being seen, but they do not stop the flow of electrons on the network, which crosses all State boundaries.\n⁶⁷ See WALKER, supra note 56, at 1095.\n⁶⁸ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61.\n⁶⁹ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61 (“The Internet became the network of networks using this protocol.”).\n⁷⁰ ACLU v.

World-wide Dependence on the Internet\nSince its humble beginnings in a research lab in 1969, “cyberspace has grown and spread to become a commons, a critical infrastructure that is pervasive and upon which societies worldwide have become dependent for commerce, recreation, communication, delivery of government services, research, education and a host of other activities.”76 A key qualification to being a major State power today is Internet connectivity.77 In order to survive as a State and remain economically competitive, States have to embrace the Internet and continue to build the infrastructure that it requires.78 The global networking of high speed information processing systems are “made possible by the ground based international telecommunications infrastructure and a growing constellation of satellites which provide countries with a means to acquire and transmit information.”79\nIn 2010, global Internet usage was over 2 billion people.80 Most States have public facilities, such as libraries and Internet cafés, where people can log onto the Internet for free.81 “U.S. and international businesses trade goods and services in cyberspace, moving assets across the globe in seconds. In addition to facilitating trade in other sectors, cyberspace is itself a key sector of the global economy.”82 Around the world, States’ critical infrastructures such as power distribution, telecommunications, banking, emergency services, transportation, national defense, and more are becoming ever dependent on the efficiencies offered by cyberspace.83 Stock exchanges and Air Traffic Control around the world are linked and dependent on the cyber infrastructure.84 Cyberspace has become the seas of commerce and the backbone of our global society, which demands a regime of sovereignty that will ensure the free flow of electrons currently enjoyed on the Internet.\n76 Julie J.C.H.

ESTABLISHING SOVEREIGNTY IN THE NEWEST FRONTIER\n“To Aristotle the idea of a placeless, borderless community would have seemed very strange; it appeared self-evident to him that a state — a self-governing political unit — had a definite, bounded territory in which the citizens lived and over which they exerted control.”85 Defining what constitutes sovereignty, however, is very difficult.86 Sovereignty is defined as “1. Supreme dominion, authority or rule. 2. The supreme political authority of an independent state. 3. The state itself.”87 The definition does not specify what sovereignty includes. In Article 2(4), the Charter of the United Nations speaks of protecting territorial integrity, “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”88 “Preserving state sovereignty is a vital goal of both state-based international organizations and individual countries.”89 Sovereignty, however, is treated differently in each physical domain, striking a balance between States’ interests and global needs.\n## A. The Essence of Sovereignty\n“Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is\n85 MITCHELL, supra note 34, at 151.\n86 Patrick W.

Although once thought to be merely an enhancement to the other existing domains, the concept of cyberspace as its own domain was recently accepted.¹⁰¹ Even though cyberspace is very different from the other naturally occurring domains, it does share some similarities.\n## B. Sovereignty in the Physical Domains\n“The global reach of the Internet, a network of networks, leads some to assume it is ungovernable since it reaches beyond national borders.”¹⁰² Similar concerns existed when mankind entered the domains of air and space.¹⁰³\nWhen states and individuals started developing the technological capability to enter the domains of sea, air, and outer space, strong arguments existed for each of these domains to remain free from sovereign control. However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.¹⁰⁴\n⁹⁶ See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65.\n⁹⁷ Patrick D.

Although ultimately codified in treatises, these international regimes resulted from State practices.¹⁰⁵ Since cyberspace will most likely follow the same trajectory, current State practices in cyberspace are critical to its future.\ni. Land\nOriginally, principles of sovereignty were about controlling territory and the people in it. “During the 17th century, the concept of sovereigns as individual monarchs gave way to the Westphalian state system of governments as sovereigns.”¹⁰⁶ Since the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the international system has been dominated by the State actor, which holds exclusive authority over the land and people within its geographic boundary.¹⁰⁷ “Under [this] traditional understanding of sovereignty, [States] occupy a territorially-defined physical locus, such that ‘sovereignty’ and ‘country’ are inextricably intertwined. [States] are defined by the territory they control, and [States] possess exclusive authority over events within their borders.”¹⁰⁸ Before long, States had to decide on a regime for the seas.\nii. Sea\nThe seas, which cover “two-thirds of the world’s surface,”¹⁰⁹ originally were not controlled or owned.¹¹⁰ Over time, this led way to the high seas being open to all with sovereign States only exerting control over the territorial seas bordering its country.¹¹¹ “The evolution of the law can be seen as a response to, and a reconciliation of, the conflicting interests of the Members of the international\n¹⁰⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 29 (noting that this reliance on state practices “means that a change in state interests or technological capabilities might change the legal status of these domains”).\n¹⁰⁶ J.

The three-mile limit has become thus the traditional breadth of the territorial sea.\"¹¹⁶ By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was a principle of international law that the high seas were free and open while States could exert sovereignty in their territorial waters.¹¹⁷\nSince early times, the law of the sea has had to balance conflicting economic, political, and strategic interests among States.¹¹⁸ \"With the geometric expansion of international trade following World War II . . . and the increasing awareness of interdependence among the nations of the free world, the importance of the freedom of the seas and navigation in their waters and airspace were reemphasized.\"¹¹⁹ This concept of sovereignty was first codified in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas, and culminated in 1982 with the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III),¹²⁰ which established national and international waters and airspace.¹²¹ National waters include a State's internal waters and its territorial seas.¹²² It set the territorial seas as twelve nautical miles from the States' shores.¹²³ The international waters include the contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and the high seas.¹²⁴ \"Ships and aircraft enjoy high seas freedoms,\" which include freedom of navigation and overflight of international waters.¹²⁵\nAlthough sovereignty is recognized in the territorial waters of a State, UNCLOS III provides for the \"innocent\" passage of ships, not aircraft, through these waters \"for the purpose of continuous and expeditious traversing of the territorial sea\" as long as \"it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.\"¹²⁶ The Convention prohibits the launch and recovery of aircraft and any exercise with weapons while a ship is conducting innocent passage, considering these\n112 BOWETT, supra note 109, at 1.\n113 Franzese, supra note 86, at 19; see also R.R.

It is a balance like this that the new domain of cyberspace requires.\niii. Air\nLike cyberspace, the air was initially thought to be common to all.¹³³ With the rise of property rights, the belief that the owner of the land also owned the air above it became the law.¹³⁴ The concept of air sovereignty came with the age of flight,¹³⁵ and international law regarding air sovereignty started with state practice.¹³⁶ “The actions of various states throughout World War I, especially neutral countries’ refusal to allow overflight, firmly established air sovereignty as customary international law by the end of the war.”¹³⁷ The first codification was in 1919 in the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation in France, commonly known as the Paris Convention.¹³⁸ It established exclusive sovereignty in the air, but it made an exception for the right of innocent passage across the airspace.¹³⁹ The final codification was in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Chicago Convention, which states: “the contracting States recognize that every\n¹²⁷ UNCLOS III, supra note 120, at pt.

Outer Space\nWith the dawn of rockets and satellites, the world had to decide how high up a State’s sovereignty goes.¹⁴² Some argued that it extended indefinitely, but this was not practical given the laws of planetary science and the lack of ability to exert control in space.¹⁴³ “Sovereignty can only truly exist if states can exert control, or sovereignty over the areas they claim.”¹⁴⁴ Prior to the launching of satellites and the beginning of actual space research in 1957, no sovereign conducted activity in outer space, thus precluding any effective control over outer space and the celestial bodies.¹⁴⁵ The United States and the Soviet Union were the first States to conduct actual research in outer space, but neither State made any territorial claim.¹⁴⁶ In 1958, the two States came to an early agreement to prohibit territorial sovereignty over outer space.¹⁴⁷ United States policy makers “faced the challenge to develop policy that protected Space for peaceful purposes for the good of all mankind, while at the same time that responded to the potential Armageddon-like conflict in the frigid, biting reality of the Cold War arms race.”¹⁴⁸\nThe Outer Space Treaty of 1967 codifies the legal status of outer space as free from sovereignty.¹⁴⁹ China, however, is challenging this principle and arguing that their sovereignty extends into outer space, because there is no definition of where territorial air space ends and outer space begins.¹⁵⁰ Even though the Treaty provides that exploration in space is supposed to be for peace-\n¹⁴⁰ The Convention on International Civil Aviation, Dec. 7, 1944, pt.

The domains are global in scope and indifferent to physical terrain or lines drawn on a map with near instantaneous effects transmitted through their domains. Both cyber and space are global commons vital to civil and commercial activities and essential to the economy and military operations.”¹⁵⁵\nOne major difference, however, is the ease of accessibility of cyberspace versus space. A Master’s thesis from 1965 once asked: “where is space? [W]ho controls it?”¹⁵⁶ These are the same questions that we ask today about cyberspace.\n## C. Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nCyberspace needs the rule of law inherent in sovereignty, but it needs to be open for international transit. “As with maritime trade, the path to future prosperity relies on open access, engagement and cooperation among friends and allies in the global cyberspace commons.”¹⁵⁷ Although similar to space, cyberspace cannot be a true global commons “governed collectively for the common benefit of all mankind,”¹⁵⁸ effectively prohibiting State sovereignty. The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms.¹⁵⁹ “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.”¹⁶⁰ A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance.\n¹⁵¹ Robert W.

May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”¹⁶⁴\n“The belief that cyberspace should be free from government interference, or sovereignty, led to the idea that cyberspace is, in fact, immune from state sovereignty.”¹⁶⁵ However, this ideal has become very unrealistic. Although cyberspace was once believed to be free from government control and regulation, States are being to exert their control over cyberspace in order to ensure liberty.¹⁶⁶ As a result, sovereignty needs to apply in cyberspace. “We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.”¹⁶⁷ States will have to want to exert sovereignty in cyberspace and in order to do this there will have to be borders in cyberspace. How States construct these borders is another matter.¹⁶⁸\n---\n¹⁶¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 17; see also Franzese, supra note 86, at 11–12.\n¹⁶² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 13.\n¹⁶³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 19–20 (explaining that the Communications Decency Act “punished all transmission of ‘indecent’ sexual communications or images on the Internet ‘in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age’”).\n¹⁶⁴ John Perry Barlow, *A Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace* (Feb. 8, 1996), http://www.homes.eff.org/-barlow/Declaration-Final.html.\n¹⁶⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 11.\n¹⁶⁶ LESSIG, supra note 65, at 3.\n¹⁶⁷ LESSIG, supra note 65, at 4.\n¹⁶⁸ See Forrest Hare, *Borders in Cyberspace: Can Sovereignty Adapt to the Challenges of Cyber Security*, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 88, 101–03 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/06_HARE_Borders%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n19\n## ii. The Taming of Cyberspace\nOver the last decade, States have begun exerting their sovereignty in cyberspace in response to complaints from its citizens and a need to control the information seen by those citizens. Western States have exerted control on content or access to content in order to protect their citizens from child pornography, sale of Nazi paraphernalia, and other ills.¹⁶⁹ States have also had to regulate content on the Internet in order to safeguard intellectual property. Repressive states such as China and Belarus have constructed barriers to access in an effort to keep western ideals of democracy from its citizens' purview on the Internet.¹⁷⁰\nAs far back as 1995, the Germans prosecuted the German manager of CompuServe Deutschland for \"failing to prevent child pornography, much of which came from outside Germany, from reaching German citizens.\"¹⁷¹ Regulating local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is a key to States controlling what content its citizens can view on the Internet. Once notified of the existence of illegal content, German, British, and French laws require their local ISPs to screen out the offending content.¹⁷² This protects the citizens of those States, but it does not stop the offending content from transiting the States' cyberspace.\nPrior to 2000, it was believed that a State could not control an Internet provider in another State.¹⁷³ In a landmark decision, the French courts held that Yahoo, a United States corporation, violated French law by allowing Nazi paraphernalia to appear for sale on web pages accessible in France.¹⁷⁴ Acknowledging that a one hundred percent blockage was impossible, the court \"ordered Yahoo to make a 'reasonable effort' to block French users.\"¹⁷⁵ France was not blocking the websites from its cyberspace, but it was erecting a border around its citizens whom it wanted to protect from the Nazi goods being sold.\nAlthough China allows access to the Internet, it has carefully engineered accessible content. China \"is trying to create an Internet that is free enough to support and maintain the world's fastest growing economy, and yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on power.\"¹⁷⁶ In order to accomplish this goal, China has created a \"firewall\" popularly known as the \"Great Firewall of China\" around its people that filters and removes any unapproved information headed to a Chinese national.¹⁷⁷ In 2002, Yahoo signed the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, which requires that \"Yahoo filter materials that might be harmful or threat-\n---\n¹⁶⁹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 154–57.\n¹⁷⁰ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 87–104; ACCESS CONTROLLED: THE SHAPING OF POWER, RIGHTS, AND RULE IN CYBERSPACE 161–69, 449–73 (Ronald Deibert et al. eds., 2010); LESSIG, supra note 65, at 79–80, 308; see generally Fyodor Pavlyuchenko, Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 156, 156–62 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., Kenneth Geers trans. 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/11_PAVLYUCHENKO_Belorussia.pdf (censorship).\n¹⁷¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n¹⁷² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n¹⁷³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 1–10.\n¹⁷⁴ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 7–8.\n¹⁷⁵ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 8.\n¹⁷⁶ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 89.\n¹⁷⁷ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 92–93 (outlining the process by which the \"Great Firewall of China\" filters unapproved internet information); ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nening to Party rule.”¹⁷⁸ These processes, however, do not prevent the data from actually entering China. Thus, determined savvy Internet users are able to circumvent most, if not all, of these barriers with relative ease.¹⁷⁹\nE-commerce requires a stable environment controlled by a sovereign who can protect companies and consumers from fraud. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, desired to make a company self-regulated by its users, but “quickly learned that to prevent fraud, enforce its contracts, and ensure stability in its auction services, it would depend critically on government coercion and the rule of law provided by a stable country like the United States.”¹⁸⁰ Originally run by community enforcement, eBay now has a full-time security staff of over eight hundred people.¹⁸¹\nStates are creating boundaries in cyberspace to protect its citizens, rather than its territory. Cyber crimes are being prosecuted by States regardless of the fact that the person was not physically within the State’s territory when accessing the Internet. The United States prosecutes a man who views child pornography on the Internet while physically being in another country by using extra-territorial jurisdiction.¹⁸² “Developing sovereignty, [however,] ultimately requires an international regime with specific rules and procedures regulating state activity in that domain, including a requirement to identify and track transnational actors.”¹⁸³\niii. A Navigational Regime for Cyberspace – Transit Passage\nAs with the domains of sea, air, and space, there is a need for international space in cyberspace. “And like the seas, the U.S. will feel the need to maintain ‘freedom of navigation’ in cyberspace as a primary beneficiary of its existence.”¹⁸⁴ The networks of cyberspace need to be kept “open for the economic, social, and security interests of this country and its citizens.”¹⁸⁵ Cyberspace has provided an information-based revolution in the public, private, and military sectors.¹⁸⁶\nThis domain, however, is very different from the other physical domains. A State may not even be aware of someone in their cyberspace. Cyber operations occur “at computing speeds delivered at the speed of light.”¹⁸⁷ In order to physically enter a State, a traveler must present a passport; yet a cyber traveler can enter any State in cyberspace without any documents. This freedom is not something that we want to stop with the recognition of sovereignty in cyberspace. Therefore, international law needs to adopt a regime for cyberspace that allows for the free flow of electrons through all of cyberspace.\n¹⁷⁸ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 9.\n¹⁷⁹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 103; ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\n¹⁸⁰ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129.\n¹⁸¹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129–135.\n¹⁸² LESSIG, supra note 65, at 299.\n¹⁸³ Franzese, supra note 86, at 34 (emphasizing that because cyberspace is man-made, it is necessarily influenced by politics and shaped by social actions and institutions); see also Geoffrey L.

There are no clear borders in cyberspace. Once a packet of information is launched into cyberspace, it is nearly impossible to tell when it passes from one sovereign to another until it finally arrives. “Although every computer, server, and wire is located in some place subject to other regulatory frameworks, the paths by which packets travel across the Internet are largely beyond the control of the user and may pass through many different sovereign jurisdictions in route from senders to recipient.”¹⁹⁰ In an international strait, the territorial seas of more than one State overlap. The public and freely accessible parts of cyberspace are like international straits connecting the sovereign territories where the hardware is located.\n“[T]ransit passage allows all ships and aircraft freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the international strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.”¹⁹¹ Cyberspace absolutely requires this type of framework in order not to disrupt the flow of ideas and commerce in cyberspace. “Transit passage” would allow the electrons to transit cyberspace in their normal mode of operation. No State could suspend transit passage of its cyberspace; but if it so chose, it could disconnect from the network. In addition, transit passage would apply to military operations and would allow for the transit passage through a neutral territory. The hardware, however, is actually in sovereign territory. The relationship between the physical hardware and cyberspace is similar to that of territorial waters and the high seas.\n“Every component of every information and telecommunications network around the world, under the sea, and in the air is subject to proprietary interests – whether that of a private company, a sovereign government, or possibly both. Each copper wire, fiber-optic cable, microwave relay tower, satellite transponder, or Internet router has been produced or installed by some entity whose legal successors not only maintain ownership of that physical asset but also expect protection of the same by sovereign authorities.”¹⁹²\nRecognizing a right of “transit passage” in cyberspace would merely make current State practice customary international law. Every day, States violate the sovereignty of other States as emails from one office transit across national boundaries in route to the office next door. Because of the way the Internet operates, one message can be broken up into multiple packets that travel the public Internet in the most expeditious manner regardless of path. Cyberspace knows no boundaries; packets do not request permission when transiting from one State to another.\n¹⁸⁸ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 51.\n¹⁸⁹ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 58; see also Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, and Benjamin Tilly, Metcalf’s Law is Wrong, IEEE SPECTRUM (July 2006), http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-iswrong.\n¹⁹⁰ Ryan et al., supra note 76, at 89.\n¹⁹¹ Barney, supra note 159, at 75.\n¹⁹² Kanuck, supra note 20, at 1573.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nPrivate password protected networks in cyberspace should be treated as internal waters, where complete territorial sovereignty is imposed. Information from unauthorized users on these networks would violate territorial sovereignty. The Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) would be one example of such network. This type of regime would balance society's need for freedom of navigation of cyberspace while protecting national security.\nSovereignty in cyberspace is required and States will need to exert this sovereignty. It is imperative that States police crime, protect property interest, and take action against known attacks originating within its cyberspace.^[193]^ Global society is heavily reliant on the Internet's continuing functionality, which requires packets to continue surfing freely through cyberspace. In addition, States cannot currently exert territorial control over the electrons passing through its cyberspace; therefore, there is no way to enforce exclusive sovereignty in cyberspace. Consequently, States should operate in cyberspace, assuming a right of \"transit passage,\" and, with time, the practice will become a part of customary international law.\n## IV. APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT TO CYBERSPACE\nThe governance of cyberspace will require the utilization of all types of law, such as criminal law, tort law, and property law. Since cyberspace interconnects global society, it most assuredly will require international law. As long as cyberwar is possible, the international body of law known as the law of armed conflict^[194]^ will apply to cyberspace.\n## A. Applying the Law of Armed Conflict to Cyberspace\nOver the last decade, great scholars have debated whether the law of armed conflict (LOAC) should apply to cyberspace, and the majority consensus agrees that it should.^[195]^ The pivotal question,\n^[193]^ See generally Matthew J.

Additional Protocol I requires a State to review any “new weapon, means or method of warfare to ensure its employment would not violate international law.”²⁰⁰\nWhat activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force is the subject of much debate. “At a point along the spectrum of interstate activities called the line of belligerency, a use of force by a state establishes an international armed conflict as a matter of law and the law of armed conflict applies.”²⁰¹ Jus ad bellum is this body of international law, found in both customary and treaty law, governing a State’s resort to force against another state.²⁰² The UN Charter is the primary modern source of jus ad bellum.²⁰³ In accordance with the UN Charter, “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”²⁰⁴ In order to know what activities between states are forbidden in cyberspace, we must know what activities constitute the threat or use of force in cyberspace. In Article 51, the UN Charter offers that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”²⁰⁵ Humanity must determine what an armed attack is in cyberspace in order to know when a state has a right to protect itself. “Although a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense [under Article 51] in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.”²⁰⁶\napplicabilityofihltocna.pdf (applying international humanitarian law); Dunlap, supra note 21, at 81–95 (arguing basic tenets of LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT are sufficient to address cyberwar); Todd, supra note 3, at 66–102 (arguing for a definition-based approach); David E.

Defining the Use of Force/Armed Attack in Cyberspace\nWithout defining any of the terms individually, the UN Charter uses the terms “use of force,” “armed attack,” and “aggression” in its various provisions, spurring over fifty years of debate about the terms’ meanings.²⁰⁷ Although economic and political coercion can threaten international stability, generally the use of force is understood to mean armed force.²⁰⁸ “Until the advent of information operations, most coercion could be handily categorized into one of several boxes, for few options existed that could not be typed as political, economic, or armed in nature.”²⁰⁹ Cyber attacks, however, do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Cyber attacks are launched for a multitude of reasons with a wide spectrum of effects. Therefore, it had to be determined “whether a cyber attack, because it does not involve the use of kinetic force, is a prohibited use of force under the Charter and customary international law.”²¹⁰ Michael N. Schmitt analyzed this and answered it in the affirmative, stating “the key is to move from an instrument-based paradigm (economics, politics, kinetic military force) to one based on the consequences caused by the action.”²¹¹ To help analyze the consequences of an operation, Schmitt developed seven criteria to determine whether the effects are “more like those caused by economic and political coercion or by physical coercion.”²¹²\nIn defining the use of force in cyberspace, most scholars look to the seven-factor analysis proposed by Michael N. Schmitt to determine a use of force.²¹³ These factors include: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and State responsibility²¹⁴ and give a qualitative analysis of how military operations differ from nonmilitary operations, such as diplomatic and economic coercion.²¹⁵ The use of force does not include non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare.²¹⁶\nThe next major law of armed conflict issue is evaluating when a cyber attack amounts to an “armed attack” under Article 51, allowing a State to respond with force in self-defense.²¹⁷ The previous analysis is not applicable in this determination, because “use of force” and “armed attack” is not the same.²¹⁸ Typically, cyber attacks with violent effects are the legally equivalent to armed attacks.²¹⁹ Therefore, cyber attacks utilizing cyber weapons (e.g., viruses, worms, logic bombs) and resulting in human suffering or property damage (beyond the computer program or data attacked) can be\n207 Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 199, at 150; SHARP, SR., supra note 2, at 73.\n208 Schmitt, supra note 195, at 908.\n209 Schmitt, supra note 195, at 908.\n210 Michael N.

In those instances, however, where there is an international armed conflict and the law of armed conflict does apply, States need to know their obligations under the law of neutrality.\n## V. NEUTRALITY\nThe designers created the Internet, as implied by its name, to be a single network to link data across States and oceans.²²⁵ In reality, the Internet is a multitude of different linked networks.²²⁶ Therefore, there is no way to predict the State or States through which a packet will travel during transmission.²²⁷ A belligerent cannot know which route its cyber attack will take on its way to its target, which makes it impossible to ensure that it does not cross a neutral’s cyberspace territory.²²⁸\nIn a cyberwar, how a State remains neutral has been the subject of much discourse. The primary question is whether an electron from a belligerent State crossing through a neutral State’s cyberspace territory is a violation of the law of neutrality.²²⁹ Another question is whether a neutral State is required to take action against a belligerent electron transiting its cyberspace. “More than a century after the Hague Conventions’ enactment, their general conception of neutrality remains controlling law, but international law does not explicitly address cyberattacks and cyber neutrality.”²³⁰ This paper argues that an electron passing through a neutral’s State’s cyberspace does not violate the neutral’s sovereignty and should not require action by the neutral State.²³¹ Since it appears that there is not go-\n220 Dörmann, supra note 195, at 4.\n221 See Dunlap, supra note 21, at 86 (recognizing the importance of neutrally assessing the consequences of a cyber incident to see if it rises to the equivalent level of an armed attack); see also Rowe, supra note 195, at 1.\n222 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 99.\n223 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 99.\n224 Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 199, at 172; Huntley, supra note 18, at 2–3 (implying that certain principles of international law do little to control states in cyber space).\n225 Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432.\n226 Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432 (“Keeping with its military roots, the Internet has a significant level of redundancy in the backbone, such that if one network experiences a problem the Internet can reroute traffic in real time to avoid it.”).\n227 See Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432.\n228 See Lessig, supra note 65, at 63.\n229 John S.

The Law of Neutrality\nThe law of neutrality embodied in the Hague Conventions is basically as old as time, in the sense it is based on basic economic principles. Neutrals want to stay out of war and yet want to protect their commerce and trade routes. Belligerents need resources, which neutrals have. Since the law of neutrality has endured with little change through all of the technological revolutions of the last several centuries, there is no reason to believe the same law will not apply in cyberspace, where commerce along with communication is paramount.\n## i. History of Neutrality\nAs early as the fourteenth century and possibly even earlier, “neutrality” was applied in its modern sense.²³³ Since at least the fifteenth century, a prime objective of belligerents was the destruction of the enemy’s trade, which appears to have led to the law of neutral rights at sea.²³⁴\nThe problem has always been the reconciliation of the incompatible interests of neutrals and belligerents, or, rather, a compromise between these irreconcilable interests. The neutral has sought to maintain his freedom of trade; the belligerent has sought to cut off all supplies from his enemy. The desire to seize goods of the enemy may be\nHUMANITARIAN LAW RESEARCH INITIATIVE, COMPUTERS AND WAR: THE LEGAL BATTLESPACE 15 (2004), (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University), http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf (asserting the mere routing of data through a neutral State is allowed), with LAWRENCE T.

Therefore, there must be an international armed conflict in order for the law of neutrality to apply.²⁴⁰ Hague Convention III Relative To the Opening of Hostilities governs the beginning of hostilities. With regards to neutral states, Hague Convention III states:\nThe existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware of the existence of a state of war.²⁴¹\nThese provisions will limit the application of neutrality law to cyberwarfare. Thus far, no States have taken responsibility for any cyber attacks.\nIn circumstances where a cyber attack rises to the level of a cyberwar,²⁴² the States involved in the conflict would need to be identified. In accordance with Hague Convention III, the parties to conflict would need to notify neutral States. Until that time, a neutral State would not be bound by the obligations of Hague Convention V, unless they should have known about the conflict. Even if a cyber attack is deemed an \"armed attack,\" generally the identity of the attacker is unknown. In such\n²³⁵ Id. at xii.\n²³⁶ Id.\n²³⁷ Id. at xiii.

The movement of troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies by belligerents across the territory of a neutral state is forbidden.²⁴³ Belligerents are forbidden from erecting wireless telegraphy stations or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea on the territory of a neutral state.²⁴⁴ They are further prohibited from using any of such stations erected prior to the war on the territory of a neutral state for purely military purposes, unless it has been opened for the service of public messages.²⁴⁵ These prohibitions apply only to direct communications by belligerents to their forces.²⁴⁶ A neutral State has a responsibility to prohibit such activity from being conducted on its territory.²⁴⁷ Certainly, belligerents may not launch an attack from within the telecommunication infrastructure of a neutral State.²⁴⁸ There is an exception, however, to this principle of information warfare.\na. Telegraph Exception\nA neutral State is allowed to let belligerents use telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to the neutral State or its nationals.²⁴⁹ The neutral State does, however, have to ensure any restrictions or prohibitions are applied impartially to both belligerents.²⁵⁰ The same applies for private infrastructure systems.²⁵¹ If this is the case, a belligerent may utilize the State's telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.²⁵² The level of State activism by the neutral, though, may range; the greater the degree of activism, the more likely it is a neutral State will violate its duties under the law of neutrality.²⁵³ It is one thing for private companies of a neutral State to conduct commerce with a belligerent State, and another for the State itself to assist a belligerent.²⁵⁴ As long as a neutral State impartially makes its networks available to both sides, there is no reason\n²⁴³ Hague Convention V Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 18 October 1907, art. 2 [hereinafter Hague V].\n²⁴⁴ Id. art. 3(a).\n²⁴⁵ Id. art. 3(b).\n²⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 195, at 208.\n²⁴⁷ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 5.\n²⁴⁸ Schmitt et al., supra note 231, at 15.\n²⁴⁹ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 8.\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 9.\n²⁵¹ Brown, supra note 195, at 208 (explaining why there is no duty on neutral states to restrict belligerents from using its own communications systems or privately owned systems, so long as the neutral state and the privately owned systems are impartial).\n²⁵² Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n²⁵³ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (stating the more active a State is in helping a belligerent, the more likely it is violating the law of neutrality); see infra Part VI.\n²⁵⁴ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83; see generally L.

Law of the Seas “Peaceful Passage”\nHague Convention XIII governs the rights and duties of neutral States in naval war.²⁵⁷ The provisions are similar to those on land, but “the neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of war-ships or prizes belonging to belligerents.”²⁵⁸ Belligerent war-ships can remain in a port or territorial water of a neutral state for up to twenty-four hours.²⁵⁹\nIn addition to Hague XIII, the Law of the Sea Convention provides more guidance to neutrals and belligerents in regards to the different navigational regimes.²⁶⁰ In international straits, it protects the right of transit passage, even through neutral straits.²⁶¹ Belligerent forces transiting a neutral international strait must refrain from hostile activities not incident to their transit, but they may “take defensive measures consistent with their security, including the launching and recovery of military devices, screen formation steaming, and acoustic and electronic surveillance, and may respond in self-defense to a hostile act or hostile intent.”²⁶² Once again, analogizing cyberspace to an international strait results in a potentially practical rule for international law.\nDue to the way the Internet is structured, it is foolhardy to prohibit a cyber weapon to peacefully pass through a neutral State’s cyberspace. In most situations, the neutral State will not even know that the electrons passed through its sovereignty.²⁶³ Nor is there much the State can do, short of severing all computer connections with other States.\n## B. Responsibility of a Neutral\nSome scholars argue that a neutral must keep electrons from a belligerent from transiting its cyberspace.²⁶⁴ These same scholars suggest that a neutral will lose its protected status if it fails to meet this impossible burden.\nUnder this rule, if a neutral state cannot or does not take action to halt a cyber attack, a belligerent may choose to counter by physically attacking the neutral state’s commu\n²⁵⁵ SCHMITT ET AL., *supra* note 231, at 15 (adding that if a neutral state does not act impartially, the “victim” belligerent may take necessary and proportionate steps to end the violation).\n²⁵⁶ TIKK ET AL., *supra* note 18, at 83.\n²⁵⁷ Hague Convention XIII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 18 October 1907.\n²⁵⁸ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 10.\n²⁵⁹ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 12.\n²⁶⁰ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n²⁶¹ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4 (caveating the idea that a neutral nation may suspend passage of belligerent warships through its territorial seas).\n²⁶² COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n²⁶³ See Kelsey, *supra* note 28, at 1444–45 (considering the scope of the duty of neutrality; specifically, whether neutral states hold the practical methods of detecting a cyber attack).\n²⁶⁴ Kastenberg, *supra* note 26, at 56 (“A surrender of neutrality or acquiescence to belligerent activity may draw a neutral state into the conflict”).\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nnications infrastructure. Thus, even without the physical violation of a neutral state's territory, a cyber attack may force a neutral state to become unwillingly involved.²⁶⁵\nWhy should we espouse such an impossible burden on neutrals? Nothing in the Hague Conventions suggests that a State must defend against anything less than a physical invasion of its territory. The Hague Conventions allow for warships to pass through territorial waters of a neutral and for the usage of telecommunication infrastructure. Jeffrey Kelsey in *Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare* argues that the meaning of neutrality should evolve to an “intent-based view of neutrality” so that neutrals are able to escape an impossible burden.²⁶⁶ “This view would not require the neutral state to take action to prevent the unintentional passage of the cyber weapons through its borders . . .”²⁶⁷ This is the right answer, but international law already allows for this.\nIt is an entirely different situation where a neutral State allows a belligerent to conduct attacks from its cyberspace.²⁶⁸ In these cases, the neutral needs to aggressively pursue those committing these attacks or face attack upon its own network. A neutral must also ensure that its servers are not being used for command and control of belligerent fighters. In such a case, “the server might be a valid military target because it’s being used for the communications or command and control of the enemy fighters in the areas of hostilities.”²⁶⁹ “Although every server has a physical location, the Internet is not segmented along national borders, and the enemy may gain greater tactical advantage from a server hosted half way around the world than from one located right in the middle of hostilities.²⁷⁰\nNeutrals will have to remain vigilant that belligerents do not use the servers located in their sovereign territory for command and control, or face being subject to attack. International law, however, must acknowledge that cyberspace falls under the telegraph exception to the law of neutrality, allowing electrons to freely transit cyberspace. One must remember that the law of neutrality only applies in an actual international armed conflict in cyberspace. Just because there is an international armed conflict on the ground does not necessarily mean there is a conflict in cyberspace, triggering the law of neutrality. The next section applies these concepts to the cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008.\n## VI. CASE STUDY – CYBER ATTACKS ON GEORGIA (JULY/AUGUST 2008)\nIn the summer of 2008, attacks on Georgian government websites coincided with an actual military ground conflict.²⁷¹ From July 18 to 20, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks hit the\n²⁶⁵ Kastenberg, supra note 26, at 56.\n²⁶⁶ Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1448–49 (requiring a showing that the belligerent intentionally directed cyber weapons through the Internet nodes of a neutral states).\n²⁶⁷ Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1449.\n²⁶⁸ SCHMITT ET AL., supra note 231, at 15 (recalling that belligerents are forbidden to launch attacks from a neutral territory).\n²⁶⁹ Bradbury, supra note 27, at 19.\n²⁷⁰ Bradbury, supra note 27, at 19.\n²⁷¹ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 67–68 (chronicling the Russian invasion into Georgia following a period of separatist provocations).\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n31\nwebsite for Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili.²⁷² Distributed denial-of-service attacks seek to prevent individual users from using a computer resource, such as a website, by flooding the network with bogus requests.²⁷³ After years of tension in the South Ossetia region of Georgia between the Georgian military and the Russian backed separatist forces, the Georgian government made a surprise attack on the separatists.²⁷⁴ In retaliation on August 8, 2008,²⁷⁵ Russian tanks entered Georgian territory and a large-scale kinetic war began.²⁷⁶ Substantial DDoS attacks against a large number of Georgian websites, including government, education, news and media, banking and financial²⁷⁷ began almost immediately.²⁷⁸ The Internet slowed to a crawl and websites were forced off-line.²⁷⁹ In addition, websites were hijacked and governmental websites were defaced.²⁸⁰ Cyber attacks continued to the end of August despite a cease-fire agreement on August 12, 2008 ending military operations.²⁸¹\nGeorgia, which depends on Russian and Turkish infrastructure for its Internet connectivity,²⁸² quickly moved critical websites to servers in the United States, Poland, and Estonia.²⁸³ These countries have better cyber security and were able to prevent an information blockade of Georgia.²⁸⁴ Private U.S. technology companies, unbeknownst to the United States government,²⁸⁵ allowed Georgia to use their servers for news and governmental services, not military operations.²⁸⁶ The Estonian government allowed the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hang on a server in their country and the President of Poland hosted official press releases from the Georgian government on a section of their website.²⁸⁷ Contrary to Stephen Korns' and Joshua Kastenberg's assertions in Georgia's Cyber\n²⁷² See Jose Nazario, Politically Motivated Denial of Service Attacks, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 163 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/12_NAZARIO%20Politically%20Motivated%20DDoS.pdf.

Issues of Sovereignty\nBefore considering whether the law of neutrality was violated or whether it even applied, one must look at issues of sovereignty. Since both Tulip and Google hosted Georgian websites on their servers, one can assume that Georgian citizens at least accessed these websites, if not interacted with them. These sites were on servers located in the United States without the consent of the United States government. Therefore, Georgian citizens violated the sovereignty of the United States every time they accessed these websites.²⁹¹ Unless of course, there is a right of \"transit passage,\" which would allow nationals of one State to freely transit the cyberspace of other States without the express permission of the sovereign.\n## B. Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks\nAssuming a right of \"transit passage\" exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality²⁹² because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks.²⁹³ The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic.²⁹⁴ \"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\"²⁹⁵ Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.²⁹⁶\n288 Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 26, at 60 (asking whether the Georgian case impacted America's status as a cyber neutral and, more broadly, whether the United States can remain neutral during a cyber conflict).\n289 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (\"the fact that a neutral state permits use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment does not automatically entail breach of neutrality for that state.\").\n290 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n291 This may seem improbable since Georgia is an ally of the United States and it is hard to believe the United States would object to an ally transiting its cyberspace. Compare this, however, to the physical world where that would translate to Canadians crossing the United States border without a passport. See Fredland, supra note 286 and accompanying text.\n292 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n293 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 80.\n294 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n295 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n296 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 74–75.\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n33\nThere is no doubt regarding the involvement of the Russian hacker community in the cyber attacks: the coordination of and support to the attacks took place mainly in the Russian language and was conducted on Russian or Russia-friendly forums. However, there is no evident link to the Russian administration, and the Russian government has denied any involvement in the cyber assaults. The Project Grey Goose team was unable to find, in their research into the Russian hacker sites, any references to state organizations guiding or directing attacks.²⁹⁷\nIn fact, a self-appointed representatives of the Russian hacker underground claimed responsibility for a “Stop Georgia” website, which was set up to coordinate some of the cyber attacks on Georgian websites.²⁹⁸ When cyber attacks cannot be sufficiently linked to ongoing hostilities, the cyber attacks cannot take on the legal classification of the physical conflict. At this point, the cyber attacks must go through their own analysis.\nIn the end, the damage was minimal — email disruptions and website unavailability.²⁹⁹ The damages were further limited by the low interconnectivity of the country.³⁰⁰ “The main damage was in limiting the nation’s possibilities to distribute information about the ongoing military conflict, in ‘making its voice heard’ to the world and in communicating with the Georgian people.”³⁰¹ The effects of the cyber attacks alone were not severe enough to amount to a “use of force” under Article 2(4) and certainly not enough to justify self-defense in response to an “armed attack” under Article 51³⁰² therefore, neither the law of armed conflict nor the law of neutrality applied.\n## C. Regardless, the Law of Neutrality Would Not Have Been Violated\nEven if LOAC did apply to the situation, the telegraph exception to Hague V would permit a neutral State to allow the use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.³⁰³\nOf course, the level of state activism in permitting the use of telecommunications may range, from simply accepting data flow through private infrastructure to lending server space as was the case with Poland and Estonia, to actively supporting the functioning of telecommunications. Not all activities on this scale need necessarily be interpreted in a similar measure in the light of Article 8 of the Hague Convention cited above, but the smaller the degree of state activism, the less there is reason to speak of the state violating neutrality.³⁰⁴\n²⁹⁷ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁸ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁹ Kaminski, supra note 7, at 82 (distinguishing “actual damage” from the immeasurable damage that resulted from the attacks).\n³⁰⁰ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰¹ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰² Todd, supra note 16, at 91–92 (“There was no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack . . . The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy.”).\n³⁰³ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n³⁰⁴ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nIn addition, the cyber attacks were not military operations since Russia denied all involvement and there was no actual evidence to the contrary.³⁰⁵ Therefore, the actions of the neutral States could not have interfered with military operations.³⁰⁶ Georgia also treated the cyber attacks as a computer security issue, rather than as cyberwarfare.³⁰⁷ The website that the neutral States assisted with were communication outlets and not military in nature.³⁰⁸\nFinally, Hague V requires that if a neutral State allows the use of its telecommunications infrastructure by belligerents, it must do so impartially.³⁰⁹ Russia never requested any similar assistance; therefore, there is no evidence of impartiality.³¹⁰ Consequently, even if the law of armed conflict applied to the cyber attack in Georgia, the assisting States did nothing in violation of the law of neutrality.³¹¹\n## D. Cyber Cooperation\nThe assistance by Poland, Estonia, and the United States companies has been described as a “cyber alliance.”³¹² This alliance limited the damages that the cyber attacks caused on Georgia.³¹³ The governments of Poland and Estonia supported Georgia with technical assistance and server space.³¹⁴ In addition, two private companies in the United States gave Georgia server space.³¹⁵ Since the cyber attacks were considered the work of hackers, it was a criminal problem.³¹⁶ As such, these attacks were separate from the international armed conflict, which was conducted on the ground in Georgia. It is in the interest of all States to have a global response to such criminal attacks. States should not be afraid to assist in such non-state sponsored cyber attacks, because they fear violating the law of neutrality. Cyber security is going to take a global effort to be effective.\n## VII. CONCLUSION\nThe designers of the Internet were utopians, who created a decentralized network to withstand nuclear attack, intending it to be a domain free of government control. They believed that this new parallel world could escape the evils of government. The designers envisioned new communities\n305 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n306 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n307 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n308 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n309 Hague V, supra note 243, art. 8–9 (seeing the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telecommunications infrastructure).\n310 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n311 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n312 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266 (using this terms to explain how these nations helped Georgia mitigate the consequences of the cyber attacks, through the help of resources).\n313 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266.\n314 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266.\n315 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 77.\n316 See generally McGavran, supra note 199, at 262 (explaining that criminal syndicates rent hijacked computers to the highest bidder for a low price, around four cents).\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n35\nin cyberspace would develop better ways of regulating conduct than traditional government. In the beginning, it appeared that this new domain was borderless and beyond the control of States.\nWith time, however, cyberspace succumbed to human nature and its malfeasance. Citizens are now looking to their sovereigns to police the bad acts occurring in cyberspace. As e-commerce has exploded in cyberspace, companies also want the protections offered by a sovereign such as stability and preservation of property rights. The free flow of information has threatened the existence of other sovereigns, who control their people through restricting and molding the information available to their citizenry.\nAs States exert control in cyberspace, borders are forming in cyberspace. These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nThe UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace,³¹⁷ this is an infeasible burden.\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure.

It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself. From a more technical point of view, this is scarcely true because in its modern meaning \"neutrality\" is a legal status involving certain rights and duties. It therefore contemplates the existence of some sort of international legal system.\n# I. INTRODUCTION\nUnlike the physical domains of land, sea, air, and outer space, the new man-made domain of cyberspace cannot be seen or felt for it \"is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time-space continuum.\" Since its creation by man, cyberspace has greatly expanded the interconnectivity of the world. \"Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light.\" It has led to advancements in all areas of life. At the same time, however, cyberspace creates great new vulnerabilities, which have the potential to disrupt peace and stability in the world.\nAlthough cyberspace has existed for the last several decades, there are still no international rules, much less standard definitions applicable to this new domain.

Among the differing definitions of cyberspace, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) defines cyberspace as “[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”\nAlthough DoD has a definition of cyberspace, it is at times paralyzed in conducting cyber operations due to a lack of any international agreement or even understanding on the application of sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, and neutrality in cyberspace. “[M]ilitary strategists argue that these uncertainties have led to excess caution on the part of Pentagon planners” who are “tremendously sensitive to collateral damage by virtual weapons, but not nearly sensitive enough to damage by kinetic” ones. In October 2011, the New York Times reported that the United States debated using cyber warfare to open the campaign against Libya in March 2011, but rejected its usage in favor of kinetic strikes. In speculating on the reason behind the decision not to use cyber warfare, the article mentions “potential legal complications.” One of the impediments may have been a fear\n Frampton, supra note 4, at 13 (stating the United Nations Charter defines terms such as, an act of aggression, threat of use of force, and an armed attack in the context of Jus Ad Bellum but are silent on their application in a cyber context).\n See generally MARK WESTON JANIS, AMERICA AND THE LAW OF NATIONS 1776-1939 I-2 (2010) (arguing the law referred to as the law of nations or international law has not meant the same thing to everyone, causing fierce debates in America over international law when in reality the two sides were actually arguing over different things); Ryan T.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.” “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.” Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.” At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons. Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare. “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.” This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.\n John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated. The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful. In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations. Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it. Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.” While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status. A misguided view of the law of\n See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

It appears Stuxnet sole mission was “to attack and destroy as many of the Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges as possible thereby directly slowing down the progress of the Iranian nuclear programme.” At the Natanz nuclear research establishment, it damaged approximately 1,000 centrifuges used for Uranium enrichment. “Stuxnet may have been more effective than a conventional military attack and may have avoided a major international crisis over collateral damage.” In addition, States should not fail to aid another State in a cyber crisis out of an apprehension of losing its neutral status.\nOnce thought to be borderless and free of government control, States are transforming cyberspace by exerting their sovereignty in this new domain. Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality. Part VI wraps up analyzing how States did not lose neutral status by assisting Georgia in 2008 during its cyber crisis. Before looking at how sovereignty and the law of neutrality apply in cyberspace, it is important to understand the structure and value of the Internet.\n## II. THE CENTERPIECE OF CYBERSPACE – THE INTERNET\n“The Net negates geometry. While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.” It is not a definable or describable place. Yet, one can find things within the Internet that one did not know existed nor where they were located. “The Net is ambient – nowhere in particular but everywhere at once.” One can access the Internet by logging on from wherever one is physically located, placing oneself virtually in cyberspace while simultaneously remaining in the territorial sovereign of where one began the journey. While virtually exploring cyberspace, one seamlessly transcends into and across the cyberspace of other States. These unique characteristics pose a challenge for sovereignty. Although the Internet is only a subset of cyberspace, this paper primarily concentrates on the Internet in exploring how to create a regime for sovereignty in cyberspace. This section examines the characteristics of the Internet that will impact the choice of a regime.\n## A. The Birth of the Internet\nIn the interest of National Security, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) provided the funding and institutional support for the research that led to the development of the Internet. Despite DoD’s motives, the aspirations and vision of a unique group of electrical engineers and unorthodox computer programmers, who desired to redesign the way computers worked in order to amplify human thinking and communication, designed the Internet. Desiring to keep the Inter-\n WILLIAM J. MITCHELL, CITY OF BITS 8 (1995).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 8–9.\n ELIZABETH C. HANSON, THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION AND WORLD POLITICS 57 (2008).\n Id.

J. C. R. Licklider, a psychologist at MIT, headed the program. The DoD created ARPA with a broad mandate to fund cutting-edge research and strategically placed the Agency directly below the Secretary of Defense. “Throughout the 1960s groups at various universities and research centers were funded to work on different aspects of interactive computing and networking.” First, the research focused on enabling users to interact with a computer through a terminal, which then turned to connecting computers in different geographic locations to enable them to collaborate and share materials. In 1965, the researchers linked a computer in Massachusetts to one in California through a telephone network, but large blocks of data caused problems when they created traffic jams. A packet-switching network, which “allows for faster travel speeds, a higher volume of information, and permits the system to withstand additional stresses,” still utilized today, turned out to be the solution.\nIn the fall of 1969 at UCLA, the first computer network, ARPANET, was born. It was deliberately designed with “a distributed, redundant structure so that it could survive partial nuclear destruction and the knockout of military headquarters.” By the end of that year, four host computers connected approximately one thousand researchers around the country. The network got bigger and bigger and was utilized more for sending messages than its original purpose of sharing expensive resources among the different research centers. In 1975, the military became interested in the network and began using it for communication. In 1982, the network was split into MILNET,\n JACK GOLDSMITH &amp; TIM WU, WHO CONTROLS THE INTERNET?, ILLUSIONS OF BORDERLESS WORLD 23 (2006) (referring to the structure of the Internet’s design as open, minimalist, and neutral because it is willing to accept any time of computer or network to join, does not require much of the computers or networks to join, and treats all applications the same).\n Id.\n HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (commenting the design was to ensure the project would be independent of pressures from individual services for specific projects).\n See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (asserting that there was interest throughout the United States of people who were eager to reinvent computing).\n See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n See Sharon R.

The Backbone of the Internet\nThe Internet is a very large system of interconnected networks “with significant built-in capacity to resist concentrations of power and authoritarian control.”60 It is a packet-switching network, which distributes messages by breaking them up into smaller addressed packets that follow independent routes to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original message.61 Instead of a central control, independent routers ensure “the addressed packets flow around saturated channels.”62 Not only does this system provide improved efficiency, it provides a more secure system of communication.63 “If one node goes down, the network reroutes around it.”64 Depending on the demand at any given time, packets travel on the most efficient path, causing there to be no predictable paths of travel.65 There is also no way of prohibiting a packet from traveling on an open network of a particular State.66 One message, depending on size, can be divided up into multitude of packets, which all theoretically can travel on a different path through the cyberspace of different sovereign\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nDifferent computers and networks are able to communicate with each other because they were all designed to use the same universal language, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). ARPA required the use of this common language, which spread because of its open design and its freely available software and documentation.\nNo single entity — academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit — administers the Internet. It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers . . . There is no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.\nA great deal of the functionality of the Internet is attributed to the end-to-end principle, which network architects, Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David Clark, used as their guiding principle in designing the Internet.\nRather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network — to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network's core. The core is kept as simple as possible.\nSo any changes to the architecture of the Internet such as authentication or content filtering should not be done by changes to the network itself, but rather by applications attached to the network.\nThe backbone of the Internet being the packet-switching network and the common language of TCP/IP is essential to maintain the current interoperable Internet. In the interest of cyber security, commercial and governmental organizations utilize firewalls to protect themselves from the evils lurking on the Internet. These firewalls are applications that keep computers safe from some attacks and prevent some websites from being seen, but they do not stop the flow of electrons on the network, which crosses all State boundaries.\n See WALKER, supra note 56, at 1095.\n See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61.\n See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61 (“The Internet became the network of networks using this protocol.”).\n ACLU v.

World-wide Dependence on the Internet\nSince its humble beginnings in a research lab in 1969, “cyberspace has grown and spread to become a commons, a critical infrastructure that is pervasive and upon which societies worldwide have become dependent for commerce, recreation, communication, delivery of government services, research, education and a host of other activities.”76 A key qualification to being a major State power today is Internet connectivity.77 In order to survive as a State and remain economically competitive, States have to embrace the Internet and continue to build the infrastructure that it requires.78 The global networking of high speed information processing systems are “made possible by the ground based international telecommunications infrastructure and a growing constellation of satellites which provide countries with a means to acquire and transmit information.”79\nIn 2010, global Internet usage was over 2 billion people.80 Most States have public facilities, such as libraries and Internet cafés, where people can log onto the Internet for free.81 “U.S. and international businesses trade goods and services in cyberspace, moving assets across the globe in seconds. In addition to facilitating trade in other sectors, cyberspace is itself a key sector of the global economy.”82 Around the world, States’ critical infrastructures such as power distribution, telecommunications, banking, emergency services, transportation, national defense, and more are becoming ever dependent on the efficiencies offered by cyberspace.83 Stock exchanges and Air Traffic Control around the world are linked and dependent on the cyber infrastructure.84 Cyberspace has become the seas of commerce and the backbone of our global society, which demands a regime of sovereignty that will ensure the free flow of electrons currently enjoyed on the Internet.\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\n“To Aristotle the idea of a placeless, borderless community would have seemed very strange; it appeared self-evident to him that a state — a self-governing political unit — had a definite, bounded territory in which the citizens lived and over which they exerted control.”85 Defining what constitutes sovereignty, however, is very difficult.86 Sovereignty is defined as “1. Supreme dominion, authority or rule. 2. The supreme political authority of an independent state. 3. The state itself.”87 The definition does not specify what sovereignty includes. In Article 2(4), the Charter of the United Nations speaks of protecting territorial integrity, “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”88 “Preserving state sovereignty is a vital goal of both state-based international organizations and individual countries.”89 Sovereignty, however, is treated differently in each physical domain, striking a balance between States’ interests and global needs.\n## A. The Essence of Sovereignty\n“Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nhis natural liberty and absolute right to anything that tempts him and that he can take; what he gains by the social contract is civil liberty and the legal right of property in what he possesses.”\nA domain is an area where control is exerted. “Since classical times, two domains of operation dominated military and civilian operations: land and sea.” With the development of powered flight in 1904, the domain of air became a new possibility. Finally in 1955, the birth of the “space age” opened the last physical domain, space, but it was not until the 1980s that “the US DoD acknowledged outer space as a fourth war fighting domain.” Even after the international community recognized each of these domains, it took time for States to create specifically tailored treaties for each domain to address sovereignty.\nNow the world community needs to address the development of cyberspace and how sovereignty should relate to this new domain, which is like no other for it is man-made and does not physically exist. Although once thought to be merely an enhancement to the other existing domains, the concept of cyberspace as its own domain was recently accepted. Even though cyberspace is very different from the other naturally occurring domains, it does share some similarities.\n## B. Sovereignty in the Physical Domains\n“The global reach of the Internet, a network of networks, leads some to assume it is ungovernable since it reaches beyond national borders.” Similar concerns existed when mankind entered the domains of air and space.\nWhen states and individuals started developing the technological capability to enter the domains of sea, air, and outer space, strong arguments existed for each of these domains to remain free from sovereign control. However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.\n See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65.\n Patrick D.

Land\nOriginally, principles of sovereignty were about controlling territory and the people in it. “During the 17th century, the concept of sovereigns as individual monarchs gave way to the Westphalian state system of governments as sovereigns.” Since the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the international system has been dominated by the State actor, which holds exclusive authority over the land and people within its geographic boundary. “Under [this] traditional understanding of sovereignty, [States] occupy a territorially-defined physical locus, such that ‘sovereignty’ and ‘country’ are inextricably intertwined. [States] are defined by the territory they control, and [States] possess exclusive authority over events within their borders.” Before long, States had to decide on a regime for the seas.\nii. Sea\nThe seas, which cover “two-thirds of the world’s surface,” originally were not controlled or owned. Over time, this led way to the high seas being open to all with sovereign States only exerting control over the territorial seas bordering its country. “The evolution of the law can be seen as a response to, and a reconciliation of, the conflicting interests of the Members of the international\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 29 (noting that this reliance on state practices “means that a change in state interests or technological capabilities might change the legal status of these domains”).\n J.

In 1625, Grotius determined the territorial sea to be an area in which a state could exert control over those sailing on it, as it could control someone on its land. Cornelius van Bynkershoek adopted this principle in 1702. \"In those times, the coastal [S]tate was able to exercise control over the sea within the range of a canon shot, namely, three miles. The three-mile limit has become thus the traditional breadth of the territorial sea.\" By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was a principle of international law that the high seas were free and open while States could exert sovereignty in their territorial waters.\nSince early times, the law of the sea has had to balance conflicting economic, political, and strategic interests among States. \"With the geometric expansion of international trade following World War II . . . and the increasing awareness of interdependence among the nations of the free world, the importance of the freedom of the seas and navigation in their waters and airspace were reemphasized.\" This concept of sovereignty was first codified in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas, and culminated in 1982 with the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which established national and international waters and airspace. National waters include a State's internal waters and its territorial seas. It set the territorial seas as twelve nautical miles from the States' shores. The international waters include the contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and the high seas. \"Ships and aircraft enjoy high seas freedoms,\" which include freedom of navigation and overflight of international waters.\nAlthough sovereignty is recognized in the territorial waters of a State, UNCLOS III provides for the \"innocent\" passage of ships, not aircraft, through these waters \"for the purpose of continuous and expeditious traversing of the territorial sea\" as long as \"it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.\" The Convention prohibits the launch and recovery of aircraft and any exercise with weapons while a ship is conducting innocent passage, considering these\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nIn straits used for international navigation, UNCLOS III provides for the right of “transit passage,” “freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.” During “transit passage,” ships and submarines can transit in their normal mode of operation. Bordering States are not allowed to suspend transit passage. The Convention carefully balances a State’s need for security with the world’s needs for the freedom of navigation of the seas for commerce and trade. It is a balance like this that the new domain of cyberspace requires.\niii. Air\nLike cyberspace, the air was initially thought to be common to all. With the rise of property rights, the belief that the owner of the land also owned the air above it became the law. The concept of air sovereignty came with the age of flight, and international law regarding air sovereignty started with state practice. “The actions of various states throughout World War I, especially neutral countries’ refusal to allow overflight, firmly established air sovereignty as customary international law by the end of the war.” The first codification was in 1919 in the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation in France, commonly known as the Paris Convention. It established exclusive sovereignty in the air, but it made an exception for the right of innocent passage across the airspace. The final codification was in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Chicago Convention, which states: “the contracting States recognize that every\n UNCLOS III, supra note 120, at pt.

Outer Space\nWith the dawn of rockets and satellites, the world had to decide how high up a State’s sovereignty goes. Some argued that it extended indefinitely, but this was not practical given the laws of planetary science and the lack of ability to exert control in space. “Sovereignty can only truly exist if states can exert control, or sovereignty over the areas they claim.” Prior to the launching of satellites and the beginning of actual space research in 1957, no sovereign conducted activity in outer space, thus precluding any effective control over outer space and the celestial bodies. The United States and the Soviet Union were the first States to conduct actual research in outer space, but neither State made any territorial claim. In 1958, the two States came to an early agreement to prohibit territorial sovereignty over outer space. United States policy makers “faced the challenge to develop policy that protected Space for peaceful purposes for the good of all mankind, while at the same time that responded to the potential Armageddon-like conflict in the frigid, biting reality of the Cold War arms race.”\nThe Outer Space Treaty of 1967 codifies the legal status of outer space as free from sovereignty. China, however, is challenging this principle and arguing that their sovereignty extends into outer space, because there is no definition of where territorial air space ends and outer space begins. Even though the Treaty provides that exploration in space is supposed to be for peace-\n The Convention on International Civil Aviation, Dec. 7, 1944, pt. I, ch.

The domains are global in scope and indifferent to physical terrain or lines drawn on a map with near instantaneous effects transmitted through their domains. Both cyber and space are global commons vital to civil and commercial activities and essential to the economy and military operations.”\nOne major difference, however, is the ease of accessibility of cyberspace versus space. A Master’s thesis from 1965 once asked: “where is space? [W]ho controls it?” These are the same questions that we ask today about cyberspace.\n## C. Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nCyberspace needs the rule of law inherent in sovereignty, but it needs to be open for international transit. “As with maritime trade, the path to future prosperity relies on open access, engagement and cooperation among friends and allies in the global cyberspace commons.” Although similar to space, cyberspace cannot be a true global commons “governed collectively for the common benefit of all mankind,” effectively prohibiting State sovereignty. The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms. “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.” A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance.\n Robert W.

Utopian Beginnings\nIn the 1990s, John Perry Barlow, lyrics writer for the Grateful Dead, advocated for a separate legal regime for cyberspace, totally outside of state control. Barlow and others believed that cyberspace was “a new frontier, where people lived in peace, under their own rules, liberated from the constraints of an oppressive society and free from government meddling.” After President Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act into law, Barlow wrote his famous *Declaration of Cyberspace Independence*, based on the Declaration of Independence, and distributed it widely.\n“Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone . . . You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one . . . Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions . . . We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”\n“The belief that cyberspace should be free from government interference, or sovereignty, led to the idea that cyberspace is, in fact, immune from state sovereignty.” However, this ideal has become very unrealistic. Although cyberspace was once believed to be free from government control and regulation, States are being to exert their control over cyberspace in order to ensure liberty. As a result, sovereignty needs to apply in cyberspace. “We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.” States will have to want to exert sovereignty in cyberspace and in order to do this there will have to be borders in cyberspace. How States construct these borders is another matter.\n---\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 17; see also Franzese, supra note 86, at 11–12.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 13.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 19–20 (explaining that the Communications Decency Act “punished all transmission of ‘indecent’ sexual communications or images on the Internet ‘in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age’”).\n John Perry Barlow, *A Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace* (Feb. 8, 1996), http://www.homes.eff.org/-barlow/Declaration-Final.html.\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 11.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 3.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 4.\n See Forrest Hare, *Borders in Cyberspace: Can Sovereignty Adapt to the Challenges of Cyber Security*, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 88, 101–03 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/06_HARE_Borders%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nOver the last decade, States have begun exerting their sovereignty in cyberspace in response to complaints from its citizens and a need to control the information seen by those citizens. Western States have exerted control on content or access to content in order to protect their citizens from child pornography, sale of Nazi paraphernalia, and other ills. States have also had to regulate content on the Internet in order to safeguard intellectual property. Repressive states such as China and Belarus have constructed barriers to access in an effort to keep western ideals of democracy from its citizens' purview on the Internet.\nAs far back as 1995, the Germans prosecuted the German manager of CompuServe Deutschland for \"failing to prevent child pornography, much of which came from outside Germany, from reaching German citizens.\" Regulating local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is a key to States controlling what content its citizens can view on the Internet. Once notified of the existence of illegal content, German, British, and French laws require their local ISPs to screen out the offending content. This protects the citizens of those States, but it does not stop the offending content from transiting the States' cyberspace.\nPrior to 2000, it was believed that a State could not control an Internet provider in another State. In a landmark decision, the French courts held that Yahoo, a United States corporation, violated French law by allowing Nazi paraphernalia to appear for sale on web pages accessible in France. Acknowledging that a one hundred percent blockage was impossible, the court \"ordered Yahoo to make a 'reasonable effort' to block French users.\" France was not blocking the websites from its cyberspace, but it was erecting a border around its citizens whom it wanted to protect from the Nazi goods being sold.\nAlthough China allows access to the Internet, it has carefully engineered accessible content. China \"is trying to create an Internet that is free enough to support and maintain the world's fastest growing economy, and yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on power.\" In order to accomplish this goal, China has created a \"firewall\" popularly known as the \"Great Firewall of China\" around its people that filters and removes any unapproved information headed to a Chinese national. In 2002, Yahoo signed the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, which requires that \"Yahoo filter materials that might be harmful or threat-\n---\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 154–57.\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 87–104; ACCESS CONTROLLED: THE SHAPING OF POWER, RIGHTS, AND RULE IN CYBERSPACE 161–69, 449–73 (Ronald Deibert et al. eds., 2010); LESSIG, supra note 65, at 79–80, 308; see generally Fyodor Pavlyuchenko, Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 156, 156–62 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., Kenneth Geers trans. 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/11_PAVLYUCHENKO_Belorussia.pdf (censorship).\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 1–10.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 7–8.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 8.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 89.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 92–93 (outlining the process by which the \"Great Firewall of China\" filters unapproved internet information); ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nening to Party rule.” These processes, however, do not prevent the data from actually entering China. Thus, determined savvy Internet users are able to circumvent most, if not all, of these barriers with relative ease.\nE-commerce requires a stable environment controlled by a sovereign who can protect companies and consumers from fraud. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, desired to make a company self-regulated by its users, but “quickly learned that to prevent fraud, enforce its contracts, and ensure stability in its auction services, it would depend critically on government coercion and the rule of law provided by a stable country like the United States.” Originally run by community enforcement, eBay now has a full-time security staff of over eight hundred people.\nStates are creating boundaries in cyberspace to protect its citizens, rather than its territory. Cyber crimes are being prosecuted by States regardless of the fact that the person was not physically within the State’s territory when accessing the Internet. The United States prosecutes a man who views child pornography on the Internet while physically being in another country by using extra-territorial jurisdiction. “Developing sovereignty, [however,] ultimately requires an international regime with specific rules and procedures regulating state activity in that domain, including a requirement to identify and track transnational actors.”\niii. A Navigational Regime for Cyberspace – Transit Passage\nAs with the domains of sea, air, and space, there is a need for international space in cyberspace. “And like the seas, the U.S. will feel the need to maintain ‘freedom of navigation’ in cyberspace as a primary beneficiary of its existence.” The networks of cyberspace need to be kept “open for the economic, social, and security interests of this country and its citizens.” Cyberspace has provided an information-based revolution in the public, private, and military sectors.\nThis domain, however, is very different from the other physical domains. A State may not even be aware of someone in their cyberspace. Cyber operations occur “at computing speeds delivered at the speed of light.” In order to physically enter a State, a traveler must present a passport; yet a cyber traveler can enter any State in cyberspace without any documents. This freedom is not something that we want to stop with the recognition of sovereignty in cyberspace. Therefore, international law needs to adopt a regime for cyberspace that allows for the free flow of electrons through all of cyberspace.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 9.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 103; ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129.\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129–135.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 299.\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 34 (emphasizing that because cyberspace is man-made, it is necessarily influenced by politics and shaped by social actions and institutions); see also Geoffrey L.

No State could suspend transit passage of its cyberspace; but if it so chose, it could disconnect from the network. In addition, transit passage would apply to military operations and would allow for the transit passage through a neutral territory. The hardware, however, is actually in sovereign territory. The relationship between the physical hardware and cyberspace is similar to that of territorial waters and the high seas.\n“Every component of every information and telecommunications network around the world, under the sea, and in the air is subject to proprietary interests – whether that of a private company, a sovereign government, or possibly both. Each copper wire, fiber-optic cable, microwave relay tower, satellite transponder, or Internet router has been produced or installed by some entity whose legal successors not only maintain ownership of that physical asset but also expect protection of the same by sovereign authorities.”\nRecognizing a right of “transit passage” in cyberspace would merely make current State practice customary international law. Every day, States violate the sovereignty of other States as emails from one office transit across national boundaries in route to the office next door. Because of the way the Internet operates, one message can be broken up into multiple packets that travel the public Internet in the most expeditious manner regardless of path. Cyberspace knows no boundaries; packets do not request permission when transiting from one State to another.\n Sorensen, supra note 8, at 51.\n Sorensen, supra note 8, at 58; see also Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, and Benjamin Tilly, Metcalf’s Law is Wrong, IEEE SPECTRUM (July 2006), http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-iswrong.\n Ryan et al., supra note 76, at 89.\n Barney, supra note 159, at 75.\n Kanuck, supra note 20, at 1573.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nPrivate password protected networks in cyberspace should be treated as internal waters, where complete territorial sovereignty is imposed. Information from unauthorized users on these networks would violate territorial sovereignty. The Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) would be one example of such network. This type of regime would balance society's need for freedom of navigation of cyberspace while protecting national security.\nSovereignty in cyberspace is required and States will need to exert this sovereignty. It is imperative that States police crime, protect property interest, and take action against known attacks originating within its cyberspace.^[193]^ Global society is heavily reliant on the Internet's continuing functionality, which requires packets to continue surfing freely through cyberspace. In addition, States cannot currently exert territorial control over the electrons passing through its cyberspace; therefore, there is no way to enforce exclusive sovereignty in cyberspace. Consequently, States should operate in cyberspace, assuming a right of \"transit passage,\" and, with time, the practice will become a part of customary international law.\n## IV. APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT TO CYBERSPACE\nThe governance of cyberspace will require the utilization of all types of law, such as criminal law, tort law, and property law. Since cyberspace interconnects global society, it most assuredly will require international law. As long as cyberwar is possible, the international body of law known as the law of armed conflict^[194]^ will apply to cyberspace.\n## A.

Therefore, law of armed conflict does not directly apply to cyberspace and does not take into account all of the differences between cyberwarfare and traditional kinetic warfare; instead, it must be applied through analogy. In addition, Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention extends the law of armed conflict to any new method of warfare. Additional Protocol I requires a State to review any “new weapon, means or method of warfare to ensure its employment would not violate international law.”\nWhat activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force is the subject of much debate. “At a point along the spectrum of interstate activities called the line of belligerency, a use of force by a state establishes an international armed conflict as a matter of law and the law of armed conflict applies.” Jus ad bellum is this body of international law, found in both customary and treaty law, governing a State’s resort to force against another state. The UN Charter is the primary modern source of jus ad bellum. In accordance with the UN Charter, “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” In order to know what activities between states are forbidden in cyberspace, we must know what activities constitute the threat or use of force in cyberspace. In Article 51, the UN Charter offers that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.” Humanity must determine what an armed attack is in cyberspace in order to know when a state has a right to protect itself. “Although a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense [under Article 51] in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.”\napplicabilityofihltocna.pdf (applying international humanitarian law); Dunlap, supra note 21, at 81–95 (arguing basic tenets of LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT are sufficient to address cyberwar); Todd, supra note 3, at 66–102 (arguing for a definition-based approach); David E.

Defining the Use of Force/Armed Attack in Cyberspace\nWithout defining any of the terms individually, the UN Charter uses the terms “use of force,” “armed attack,” and “aggression” in its various provisions, spurring over fifty years of debate about the terms’ meanings. Although economic and political coercion can threaten international stability, generally the use of force is understood to mean armed force. “Until the advent of information operations, most coercion could be handily categorized into one of several boxes, for few options existed that could not be typed as political, economic, or armed in nature.” Cyber attacks, however, do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Cyber attacks are launched for a multitude of reasons with a wide spectrum of effects. Therefore, it had to be determined “whether a cyber attack, because it does not involve the use of kinetic force, is a prohibited use of force under the Charter and customary international law.” Michael N. Schmitt analyzed this and answered it in the affirmative, stating “the key is to move from an instrument-based paradigm (economics, politics, kinetic military force) to one based on the consequences caused by the action.” To help analyze the consequences of an operation, Schmitt developed seven criteria to determine whether the effects are “more like those caused by economic and political coercion or by physical coercion.”\nIn defining the use of force in cyberspace, most scholars look to the seven-factor analysis proposed by Michael N. Schmitt to determine a use of force. These factors include: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and State responsibility and give a qualitative analysis of how military operations differ from nonmilitary operations, such as diplomatic and economic coercion. The use of force does not include non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare.\nThe next major law of armed conflict issue is evaluating when a cyber attack amounts to an “armed attack” under Article 51, allowing a State to respond with force in self-defense. The previous analysis is not applicable in this determination, because “use of force” and “armed attack” is not the same. Typically, cyber attacks with violent effects are the legally equivalent to armed attacks. Therefore, cyber attacks utilizing cyber weapons (e.g., viruses, worms, logic bombs) and resulting in human suffering or property damage (beyond the computer program or data attacked) can be\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\n## V. NEUTRALITY\nThe designers created the Internet, as implied by its name, to be a single network to link data across States and oceans. In reality, the Internet is a multitude of different linked networks. Therefore, there is no way to predict the State or States through which a packet will travel during transmission. A belligerent cannot know which route its cyber attack will take on its way to its target, which makes it impossible to ensure that it does not cross a neutral’s cyberspace territory.\nIn a cyberwar, how a State remains neutral has been the subject of much discourse. The primary question is whether an electron from a belligerent State crossing through a neutral State’s cyberspace territory is a violation of the law of neutrality. Another question is whether a neutral State is required to take action against a belligerent electron transiting its cyberspace. “More than a century after the Hague Conventions’ enactment, their general conception of neutrality remains controlling law, but international law does not explicitly address cyberattacks and cyber neutrality.” This paper argues that an electron passing through a neutral’s State’s cyberspace does not violate the neutral’s sovereignty and should not require action by the neutral State. Since it appears that there is not go-\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\ning to be any new international agreements written for cyberspace in the near future, it is imperative to interpret the existing rules in the most appropriate fashion. “Because international law imposes a dramatically different legal status on states that enter conflicts between other states as a belligerent, compared with states electing to remain neutral, the choice between belligerency and neutrality represents one of the most significant responsibilities for a sovereign’s national security decision-making body.”\n## A. The Law of Neutrality\nThe law of neutrality embodied in the Hague Conventions is basically as old as time, in the sense it is based on basic economic principles. Neutrals want to stay out of war and yet want to protect their commerce and trade routes. Belligerents need resources, which neutrals have. Since the law of neutrality has endured with little change through all of the technological revolutions of the last several centuries, there is no reason to believe the same law will not apply in cyberspace, where commerce along with communication is paramount.\n## i. History of Neutrality\nAs early as the fourteenth century and possibly even earlier, “neutrality” was applied in its modern sense. Since at least the fifteenth century, a prime objective of belligerents was the destruction of the enemy’s trade, which appears to have led to the law of neutral rights at sea.\nThe problem has always been the reconciliation of the incompatible interests of neutrals and belligerents, or, rather, a compromise between these irreconcilable interests. The neutral has sought to maintain his freedom of trade; the belligerent has sought to cut off all supplies from his enemy. The desire to seize goods of the enemy may be\nHUMANITARIAN LAW RESEARCH INITIATIVE, COMPUTERS AND WAR: THE LEGAL BATTLESPACE 15 (2004), (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University), http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf (asserting the mere routing of data through a neutral State is allowed), with LAWRENCE T.

Resources required by belligerents have served neutral states well through time. Although neutrals have long complained about breaches of the law of neutrality, it appears through history that these neutral States have netted far more gains than losses.\nii. 1907 Hague Convention V\nThe Hague Convention V Respecting The Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land and in the Hague Convention XII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War embody the international law on neutrality. Per the titles of these conventions, they apply in the case of war. Therefore, there must be an international armed conflict in order for the law of neutrality to apply. Hague Convention III Relative To the Opening of Hostilities governs the beginning of hostilities. With regards to neutral states, Hague Convention III states:\nThe existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware of the existence of a state of war.\nThese provisions will limit the application of neutrality law to cyberwarfare. Thus far, no States have taken responsibility for any cyber attacks.\nIn circumstances where a cyber attack rises to the level of a cyberwar, the States involved in the conflict would need to be identified. In accordance with Hague Convention III, the parties to conflict would need to notify neutral States. Until that time, a neutral State would not be bound by the obligations of Hague Convention V, unless they should have known about the conflict. Even if a cyber attack is deemed an \"armed attack,\" generally the identity of the attacker is unknown. In such\n Id. at xii.\n Id.\n Id. at xiii.

The movement of troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies by belligerents across the territory of a neutral state is forbidden. Belligerents are forbidden from erecting wireless telegraphy stations or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea on the territory of a neutral state. They are further prohibited from using any of such stations erected prior to the war on the territory of a neutral state for purely military purposes, unless it has been opened for the service of public messages. These prohibitions apply only to direct communications by belligerents to their forces. A neutral State has a responsibility to prohibit such activity from being conducted on its territory. Certainly, belligerents may not launch an attack from within the telecommunication infrastructure of a neutral State. There is an exception, however, to this principle of information warfare.\na. Telegraph Exception\nA neutral State is allowed to let belligerents use telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to the neutral State or its nationals. The neutral State does, however, have to ensure any restrictions or prohibitions are applied impartially to both belligerents. The same applies for private infrastructure systems. If this is the case, a belligerent may utilize the State's telecommunications infrastructure and equipment. The level of State activism by the neutral, though, may range; the greater the degree of activism, the more likely it is a neutral State will violate its duties under the law of neutrality. It is one thing for private companies of a neutral State to conduct commerce with a belligerent State, and another for the State itself to assist a belligerent. As long as a neutral State impartially makes its networks available to both sides, there is no reason\n Hague Convention V Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 18 October 1907, art. 2 [hereinafter Hague V].\n Id. art. 3(a).\n Id. art. 3(b).\n Brown, supra note 195, at 208.\n Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 5.\n Schmitt et al., supra note 231, at 15.\n Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 8.\n Id. art. 9.\n Brown, supra note 195, at 208 (explaining why there is no duty on neutral states to restrict belligerents from using its own communications systems or privately owned systems, so long as the neutral state and the privately owned systems are impartial).\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (stating the more active a State is in helping a belligerent, the more likely it is violating the law of neutrality); see infra Part VI.\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83; see generally L.

Law of the Seas “Peaceful Passage”\nHague Convention XIII governs the rights and duties of neutral States in naval war. The provisions are similar to those on land, but “the neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of war-ships or prizes belonging to belligerents.” Belligerent war-ships can remain in a port or territorial water of a neutral state for up to twenty-four hours.\nIn addition to Hague XIII, the Law of the Sea Convention provides more guidance to neutrals and belligerents in regards to the different navigational regimes. In international straits, it protects the right of transit passage, even through neutral straits. Belligerent forces transiting a neutral international strait must refrain from hostile activities not incident to their transit, but they may “take defensive measures consistent with their security, including the launching and recovery of military devices, screen formation steaming, and acoustic and electronic surveillance, and may respond in self-defense to a hostile act or hostile intent.” Once again, analogizing cyberspace to an international strait results in a potentially practical rule for international law.\nDue to the way the Internet is structured, it is foolhardy to prohibit a cyber weapon to peacefully pass through a neutral State’s cyberspace. In most situations, the neutral State will not even know that the electrons passed through its sovereignty. Nor is there much the State can do, short of severing all computer connections with other States.\n## B. Responsibility of a Neutral\nSome scholars argue that a neutral must keep electrons from a belligerent from transiting its cyberspace. These same scholars suggest that a neutral will lose its protected status if it fails to meet this impossible burden.\nUnder this rule, if a neutral state cannot or does not take action to halt a cyber attack, a belligerent may choose to counter by physically attacking the neutral state’s commu\n SCHMITT ET AL., *supra* note 231, at 15 (adding that if a neutral state does not act impartially, the “victim” belligerent may take necessary and proportionate steps to end the violation).\n TIKK ET AL., *supra* note 18, at 83.\n Hague Convention XIII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 18 October 1907.\n Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 10.\n Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 12.\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4 (caveating the idea that a neutral nation may suspend passage of belligerent warships through its territorial seas).\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n See Kelsey, *supra* note 28, at 1444–45 (considering the scope of the duty of neutrality; specifically, whether neutral states hold the practical methods of detecting a cyber attack).\n Kastenberg, *supra* note 26, at 56 (“A surrender of neutrality or acquiescence to belligerent activity may draw a neutral state into the conflict”).\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nnications infrastructure. Thus, even without the physical violation of a neutral state's territory, a cyber attack may force a neutral state to become unwillingly involved.\nWhy should we espouse such an impossible burden on neutrals? Nothing in the Hague Conventions suggests that a State must defend against anything less than a physical invasion of its territory. The Hague Conventions allow for warships to pass through territorial waters of a neutral and for the usage of telecommunication infrastructure. Jeffrey Kelsey in *Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare* argues that the meaning of neutrality should evolve to an “intent-based view of neutrality” so that neutrals are able to escape an impossible burden. “This view would not require the neutral state to take action to prevent the unintentional passage of the cyber weapons through its borders . . .” This is the right answer, but international law already allows for this.\nIt is an entirely different situation where a neutral State allows a belligerent to conduct attacks from its cyberspace. In these cases, the neutral needs to aggressively pursue those committing these attacks or face attack upon its own network. A neutral must also ensure that its servers are not being used for command and control of belligerent fighters. In such a case, “the server might be a valid military target because it’s being used for the communications or command and control of the enemy fighters in the areas of hostilities.” “Although every server has a physical location, the Internet is not segmented along national borders, and the enemy may gain greater tactical advantage from a server hosted half way around the world than from one located right in the middle of hostilities.\nNeutrals will have to remain vigilant that belligerents do not use the servers located in their sovereign territory for command and control, or face being subject to attack. International law, however, must acknowledge that cyberspace falls under the telegraph exception to the law of neutrality, allowing electrons to freely transit cyberspace. One must remember that the law of neutrality only applies in an actual international armed conflict in cyberspace. Just because there is an international armed conflict on the ground does not necessarily mean there is a conflict in cyberspace, triggering the law of neutrality. The next section applies these concepts to the cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008.\n## VI.

Issues of Sovereignty\nBefore considering whether the law of neutrality was violated or whether it even applied, one must look at issues of sovereignty. Since both Tulip and Google hosted Georgian websites on their servers, one can assume that Georgian citizens at least accessed these websites, if not interacted with them. These sites were on servers located in the United States without the consent of the United States government. Therefore, Georgian citizens violated the sovereignty of the United States every time they accessed these websites. Unless of course, there is a right of \"transit passage,\" which would allow nationals of one State to freely transit the cyberspace of other States without the express permission of the sovereign.\n## B. Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks\nAssuming a right of \"transit passage\" exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks. The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic. \"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\" Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nIn fact, a self-appointed representatives of the Russian hacker underground claimed responsibility for a “Stop Georgia” website, which was set up to coordinate some of the cyber attacks on Georgian websites. When cyber attacks cannot be sufficiently linked to ongoing hostilities, the cyber attacks cannot take on the legal classification of the physical conflict. At this point, the cyber attacks must go through their own analysis.\nIn the end, the damage was minimal — email disruptions and website unavailability. The damages were further limited by the low interconnectivity of the country. “The main damage was in limiting the nation’s possibilities to distribute information about the ongoing military conflict, in ‘making its voice heard’ to the world and in communicating with the Georgian people.” The effects of the cyber attacks alone were not severe enough to amount to a “use of force” under Article 2(4) and certainly not enough to justify self-defense in response to an “armed attack” under Article 51 therefore, neither the law of armed conflict nor the law of neutrality applied.\n## C. Regardless, the Law of Neutrality Would Not Have Been Violated\nEven if LOAC did apply to the situation, the telegraph exception to Hague V would permit a neutral State to allow the use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.\nOf course, the level of state activism in permitting the use of telecommunications may range, from simply accepting data flow through private infrastructure to lending server space as was the case with Poland and Estonia, to actively supporting the functioning of telecommunications. Not all activities on this scale need necessarily be interpreted in a similar measure in the light of Article 8 of the Hague Convention cited above, but the smaller the degree of state activism, the less there is reason to speak of the state violating neutrality.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n Kaminski, supra note 7, at 82 (distinguishing “actual damage” from the immeasurable damage that resulted from the attacks).\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n Todd, supra note 16, at 91–92 (“There was no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack . . . The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy.”).\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nIn addition, the cyber attacks were not military operations since Russia denied all involvement and there was no actual evidence to the contrary. Therefore, the actions of the neutral States could not have interfered with military operations. Georgia also treated the cyber attacks as a computer security issue, rather than as cyberwarfare. The website that the neutral States assisted with were communication outlets and not military in nature.\nFinally, Hague V requires that if a neutral State allows the use of its telecommunications infrastructure by belligerents, it must do so impartially. Russia never requested any similar assistance; therefore, there is no evidence of impartiality. Consequently, even if the law of armed conflict applied to the cyber attack in Georgia, the assisting States did nothing in violation of the law of neutrality.\n## D. Cyber Cooperation\nThe assistance by Poland, Estonia, and the United States companies has been described as a “cyber alliance.” This alliance limited the damages that the cyber attacks caused on Georgia. The governments of Poland and Estonia supported Georgia with technical assistance and server space. In addition, two private companies in the United States gave Georgia server space. Since the cyber attacks were considered the work of hackers, it was a criminal problem. As such, these attacks were separate from the international armed conflict, which was conducted on the ground in Georgia. It is in the interest of all States to have a global response to such criminal attacks. States should not be afraid to assist in such non-state sponsored cyber attacks, because they fear violating the law of neutrality. Cyber security is going to take a global effort to be effective.\n## VII. CONCLUSION\nThe designers of the Internet were utopians, who created a decentralized network to withstand nuclear attack, intending it to be a domain free of government control. They believed that this new parallel world could escape the evils of government. The designers envisioned new communities\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nWith time, however, cyberspace succumbed to human nature and its malfeasance. Citizens are now looking to their sovereigns to police the bad acts occurring in cyberspace. As e-commerce has exploded in cyberspace, companies also want the protections offered by a sovereign such as stability and preservation of property rights. The free flow of information has threatened the existence of other sovereigns, who control their people through restricting and molding the information available to their citizenry.\nAs States exert control in cyberspace, borders are forming in cyberspace. These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nThe UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace, this is an infeasible burden.\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure. No other interpretation of the law of neutrality is feasible in cyberspace. A fear of violating the law of neutrality should not hinder State action in cyberspace.\n Any future change that would allow one to control the path the packets of a message travel would destroy packet switching, one of the founding principles of the Internet.",

While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.”³⁴ It is not a definable or describable place.

The Essence of Sovereignty “Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 his natural liberty and absolute right to anything that tempts him and that he can take; what he gains by the social contract is civil liberty and the legal right of property in what he possesses.”⁹⁶ A domain is an area where control is exerted.⁹⁷ “Since classical times, two domains of operation dominated military and civilian operations: land and sea.”⁹⁸ With the development of powered flight in 1904, the domain of air became a new possibility.⁹⁹ Finally in 1955, the birth of the “space age” opened the last physical domain, space, but it was not until the 1980s that “the US DoD acknowledged outer space as a fourth war fighting domain.”¹⁰⁰ Even after the international community recognized each of these domains, it took time for States to create specifically tailored treaties for each domain to address sovereignty."

However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.¹⁰⁴ ⁹⁶ See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65."

The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms.¹⁵⁹ “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.”¹⁶⁰ A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance."

It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.”¹⁴ “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”¹⁵ Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.”¹⁶ At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons.¹⁷ Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare.¹⁸ “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.”¹⁹ This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.²⁰ ¹⁴ John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated.²¹ The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful.²² In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations.²³ Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it.²⁴ Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.”²⁵ While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status.²⁶ A misguided view of the law of ²¹ See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality.

    "## II. THE CENTERPIECE OF CYBERSPACE – THE INTERNET “The Net negates geometry. While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.”³⁴ It is not a definable or describable place. Yet, one can find things within the Internet that one did not know existed nor where they were located.³⁵ “The Net is ambient – nowhere in particular but everywhere at once.”³⁶ One can access the Internet by logging on from wherever one is physically located,³⁷ placing oneself virtually in cyberspace while simultaneously remaining in the territorial sovereign of where one began the journey. While virtually exploring cyberspace, one seamlessly transcends into and across the cyberspace of other States. These unique characteristics pose a challenge for sovereignty. Although the Internet is only a subset of cyberspace, this paper primarily concentrates on the Internet in exploring how to create a regime for sovereignty in cyberspace. This section examines the characteristics of the Internet that will impact the choice of a regime.": "",
    "## A. The Birth of the Internet In the interest of National Security, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) provided the funding and institutional support for the research that led to the development of the Internet.³⁸ Despite DoD’s motives, the aspirations and vision of a unique group of electrical engineers and unorthodox computer programmers, who desired to redesign the way computers worked in order to amplify human thinking and communication, designed the Internet.³⁹ Desiring to keep the Inter- ³⁴ WILLIAM J.

C. R. Licklider, a psychologist at MIT, headed the program.⁴³ The DoD created ARPA with a broad mandate to fund cutting-edge research and strategically placed the Agency directly below the Secretary of Defense.⁴⁴ “Throughout the 1960s groups at various universities and research centers were funded to work on different aspects of interactive computing and networking.”⁴⁵ First, the research focused on enabling users to interact with a computer through a terminal, which then turned to connecting computers in different geographic locations to enable them to collaborate and share materials.⁴⁶ In 1965, the researchers linked a computer in Massachusetts to one in California through a telephone network, but large blocks of data caused problems when they created traffic jams.⁴⁷ A packet-switching network, which “allows for faster travel speeds, a higher volume of information, and permits the system to withstand additional stresses,”⁴⁸ still utilized today, turned out to be the solution.⁴⁹ In the fall of 1969 at UCLA, the first computer network, ARPANET, was born.⁵⁰ It was deliberately designed with “a distributed, redundant structure so that it could survive partial nuclear destruction and the knockout of military headquarters.”⁵¹ By the end of that year, four host computers connected approximately one thousand researchers around the country.⁵² The network got bigger and bigger and was utilized more for sending messages than its original purpose of sharing expensive resources among the different research centers.⁵³ In 1975, the military became interested in the network and began using it for communication.⁵⁴ In 1982, the network was split into MILNET, ⁴⁰ JACK GOLDSMITH &amp; TIM WU, WHO CONTROLS THE INTERNET?, ILLUSIONS OF BORDERLESS WORLD 23 (2006) (referring to the structure of the Internet’s design as open, minimalist, and neutral because it is willing to accept any time of computer or network to join, does not require much of the computers or networks to join, and treats all applications the same).\n⁴¹ Id.\n⁴² HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n⁴³ HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n⁴⁴ HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (commenting the design was to ensure the project would be independent of pressures from individual services for specific projects).\n⁴⁵ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (asserting that there was interest throughout the United States of people who were eager to reinvent computing).\n⁴⁶ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n⁴⁷ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n⁴⁸ See Sharon R.

The Backbone of the Internet The Internet is a very large system of interconnected networks “with significant built-in capacity to resist concentrations of power and authoritarian control.”60 It is a packet-switching network, which distributes messages by breaking them up into smaller addressed packets that follow independent routes to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original message.61 Instead of a central control, independent routers ensure “the addressed packets flow around saturated channels.”62 Not only does this system provide improved efficiency, it provides a more secure system of communication.63 “If one node goes down, the network reroutes around it.”64 Depending on the demand at any given time, packets travel on the most efficient path, causing there to be no predictable paths of travel.65 There is also no way of prohibiting a packet from traveling on an open network of a particular State.66 One message, depending on size, can be divided up into multitude of packets, which all theoretically can travel on a different path through the cyberspace of different sovereign\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\nDifferent computers and networks are able to communicate with each other because they were all designed to use the same universal language, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).⁶⁸ ARPA required the use of this common language, which spread because of its open design and its freely available software and documentation.⁶⁹ No single entity — academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit — administers the Internet. It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers... There is no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.⁷⁰ A great deal of the functionality of the Internet is attributed to the end-to-end principle, which network architects, Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David Clark, used as their guiding principle in designing the Internet.⁷¹ Rather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network — to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network's core. The core is kept as simple as possible.⁷² So any changes to the architecture of the Internet such as authentication or content filtering should not be done by changes to the network itself, but rather by applications attached to the network.⁷³ The backbone of the Internet being the packet-switching network and the common language of TCP/IP is essential to maintain the current interoperable Internet.⁷⁴ In the interest of cyber security, commercial and governmental organizations utilize firewalls to protect themselves from the evils lurking on the Internet.⁷⁵ These firewalls are applications that keep computers safe from some attacks and prevent some websites from being seen, but they do not stop the flow of electrons on the network, which crosses all State boundaries.\n⁶⁷ See WALKER, supra note 56, at 1095.\n⁶⁸ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61.\n⁶⁹ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61 (“The Internet became the network of networks using this protocol.”).\n⁷⁰ ACLU v.

World-wide Dependence on the Internet Since its humble beginnings in a research lab in 1969, “cyberspace has grown and spread to become a commons, a critical infrastructure that is pervasive and upon which societies worldwide have become dependent for commerce, recreation, communication, delivery of government services, research, education and a host of other activities.”76 A key qualification to being a major State power today is Internet connectivity.77 In order to survive as a State and remain economically competitive, States have to embrace the Internet and continue to build the infrastructure that it requires.78 The global networking of high speed information processing systems are “made possible by the ground based international telecommunications infrastructure and a growing constellation of satellites which provide countries with a means to acquire and transmit information.”79 In 2010, global Internet usage was over 2 billion people.80 Most States have public facilities, such as libraries and Internet cafés, where people can log onto the Internet for free.81 “U.S. and international businesses trade goods and services in cyberspace, moving assets across the globe in seconds. In addition to facilitating trade in other sectors, cyberspace is itself a key sector of the global economy.”82 Around the world, States’ critical infrastructures such as power distribution, telecommunications, banking, emergency services, transportation, national defense, and more are becoming ever dependent on the efficiencies offered by cyberspace.83 Stock exchanges and Air Traffic Control around the world are linked and dependent on the cyber infrastructure.84 Cyberspace has become the seas of commerce and the backbone of our global society, which demands a regime of sovereignty that will ensure the free flow of electrons currently enjoyed on the Internet.\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n“To Aristotle the idea of a placeless, borderless community would have seemed very strange; it appeared self-evident to him that a state — a self-governing political unit — had a definite, bounded territory in which the citizens lived and over which they exerted control.”85 Defining what constitutes sovereignty, however, is very difficult.86 Sovereignty is defined as “1. Supreme dominion, authority or rule. 2. The supreme political authority of an independent state. 3. The state itself.”87 The definition does not specify what sovereignty includes. In Article 2(4), the Charter of the United Nations speaks of protecting territorial integrity, “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”88 “Preserving state sovereignty is a vital goal of both state-based international organizations and individual countries.”89 Sovereignty, however, is treated differently in each physical domain, striking a balance between States’ interests and global needs.",
    "## A. The Essence of Sovereignty “Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 his natural liberty and absolute right to anything that tempts him and that he can take; what he gains by the social contract is civil liberty and the legal right of property in what he possesses.”⁹⁶ A domain is an area where control is exerted.⁹⁷ “Since classical times, two domains of operation dominated military and civilian operations: land and sea.”⁹⁸ With the development of powered flight in 1904, the domain of air became a new possibility.⁹⁹ Finally in 1955, the birth of the “space age” opened the last physical domain, space, but it was not until the 1980s that “the US DoD acknowledged outer space as a fourth war fighting domain.”¹⁰⁰ Even after the international community recognized each of these domains, it took time for States to create specifically tailored treaties for each domain to address sovereignty.": "Now the world community needs to address the development of cyberspace and how sovereignty should relate to this new domain, which is like no other for it is man-made and does not physically exist. Although once thought to be merely an enhancement to the other existing domains, the concept of cyberspace as its own domain was recently accepted.¹⁰¹ Even though cyberspace is very different from the other naturally occurring domains, it does share some similarities.",
    "## B. Sovereignty in the Physical Domains “The global reach of the Internet, a network of networks, leads some to assume it is ungovernable since it reaches beyond national borders.”¹⁰² Similar concerns existed when mankind entered the domains of air and space.¹⁰³ When states and individuals started developing the technological capability to enter the domains of sea, air, and outer space, strong arguments existed for each of these domains to remain free from sovereign control. However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.¹⁰⁴ ⁹⁶ See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65.": "⁹⁷ Patrick D.

Land Originally, principles of sovereignty were about controlling territory and the people in it. “During the 17th century, the concept of sovereigns as individual monarchs gave way to the Westphalian state system of governments as sovereigns.”¹⁰⁶ Since the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the international system has been dominated by the State actor, which holds exclusive authority over the land and people within its geographic boundary.¹⁰⁷ “Under [this] traditional understanding of sovereignty, [States] occupy a territorially-defined physical locus, such that ‘sovereignty’ and ‘country’ are inextricably intertwined. [States] are defined by the territory they control, and [States] possess exclusive authority over events within their borders.”¹⁰⁸ Before long, States had to decide on a regime for the seas.\nii. Sea The seas, which cover “two-thirds of the world’s surface,”¹⁰⁹ originally were not controlled or owned.¹¹⁰ Over time, this led way to the high seas being open to all with sovereign States only exerting control over the territorial seas bordering its country.¹¹¹ “The evolution of the law can be seen as a response to, and a reconciliation of, the conflicting interests of the Members of the international ¹⁰⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 29 (noting that this reliance on state practices “means that a change in state interests or technological capabilities might change the legal status of these domains”).\n¹⁰⁶ J.

The three-mile limit has become thus the traditional breadth of the territorial sea.\"¹¹⁶ By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was a principle of international law that the high seas were free and open while States could exert sovereignty in their territorial waters.¹¹⁷ Since early times, the law of the sea has had to balance conflicting economic, political, and strategic interests among States.¹¹⁸\"With the geometric expansion of international trade following World War II... and the increasing awareness of interdependence among the nations of the free world, the importance of the freedom of the seas and navigation in their waters and airspace were reemphasized.\"¹¹⁹ This concept of sovereignty was first codified in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas, and culminated in 1982 with the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III),¹²⁰ which established national and international waters and airspace.¹²¹ National waters include a State's internal waters and its territorial seas.¹²² It set the territorial seas as twelve nautical miles from the States' shores.¹²³ The international waters include the contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and the high seas.¹²⁴\"Ships and aircraft enjoy high seas freedoms,\"which include freedom of navigation and overflight of international waters.¹²⁵ Although sovereignty is recognized in the territorial waters of a State, UNCLOS III provides for the\"innocent\"passage of ships, not aircraft, through these waters\"for the purpose of continuous and expeditious traversing of the territorial sea\"as long as\"it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.\"¹²⁶ The Convention prohibits the launch and recovery of aircraft and any exercise with weapons while a ship is conducting innocent passage, considering these\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\nIn straits used for international navigation, UNCLOS III provides for the right of “transit passage,” “freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.”¹³⁰ During “transit passage,” ships and submarines can transit in their normal mode of operation.¹³¹ Bordering States are not allowed to suspend transit passage.¹³² The Convention carefully balances a State’s need for security with the world’s needs for the freedom of navigation of the seas for commerce and trade. It is a balance like this that the new domain of cyberspace requires.\niii. Air Like cyberspace, the air was initially thought to be common to all.¹³³ With the rise of property rights, the belief that the owner of the land also owned the air above it became the law.¹³⁴ The concept of air sovereignty came with the age of flight,¹³⁵ and international law regarding air sovereignty started with state practice.¹³⁶ “The actions of various states throughout World War I, especially neutral countries’ refusal to allow overflight, firmly established air sovereignty as customary international law by the end of the war.”¹³⁷ The first codification was in 1919 in the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation in France, commonly known as the Paris Convention.¹³⁸ It established exclusive sovereignty in the air, but it made an exception for the right of innocent passage across the airspace.¹³⁹ The final codification was in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Chicago Convention, which states: “the contracting States recognize that every ¹²⁷ UNCLOS III, supra note 120, at pt.

Outer Space With the dawn of rockets and satellites, the world had to decide how high up a State’s sovereignty goes.¹⁴² Some argued that it extended indefinitely, but this was not practical given the laws of planetary science and the lack of ability to exert control in space.¹⁴³ “Sovereignty can only truly exist if states can exert control, or sovereignty over the areas they claim.”¹⁴⁴ Prior to the launching of satellites and the beginning of actual space research in 1957, no sovereign conducted activity in outer space, thus precluding any effective control over outer space and the celestial bodies.¹⁴⁵ The United States and the Soviet Union were the first States to conduct actual research in outer space, but neither State made any territorial claim.¹⁴⁶ In 1958, the two States came to an early agreement to prohibit territorial sovereignty over outer space.¹⁴⁷ United States policy makers “faced the challenge to develop policy that protected Space for peaceful purposes for the good of all mankind, while at the same time that responded to the potential Armageddon-like conflict in the frigid, biting reality of the Cold War arms race.”¹⁴⁸ The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 codifies the legal status of outer space as free from sovereignty.¹⁴⁹ China, however, is challenging this principle and arguing that their sovereignty extends into outer space, because there is no definition of where territorial air space ends and outer space begins.¹⁵⁰ Even though the Treaty provides that exploration in space is supposed to be for peace- ¹⁴⁰ The Convention on International Civil Aviation, Dec. 7, 1944, pt.

The domains are global in scope and indifferent to physical terrain or lines drawn on a map with near instantaneous effects transmitted through their domains. Both cyber and space are global commons vital to civil and commercial activities and essential to the economy and military operations.”¹⁵⁵ One major difference, however, is the ease of accessibility of cyberspace versus space. A Master’s thesis from 1965 once asked: “where is space? [W]ho controls it?”¹⁵⁶ These are the same questions that we ask today about cyberspace.",
    "## C. Sovereignty in Cyberspace Cyberspace needs the rule of law inherent in sovereignty, but it needs to be open for international transit. “As with maritime trade, the path to future prosperity relies on open access, engagement and cooperation among friends and allies in the global cyberspace commons.”¹⁵⁷ Although similar to space, cyberspace cannot be a true global commons “governed collectively for the common benefit of all mankind,”¹⁵⁸ effectively prohibiting State sovereignty. The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms.¹⁵⁹ “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.”¹⁶⁰ A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance.": "¹⁵¹ Robert W.

Utopian Beginnings In the 1990s, John Perry Barlow, lyrics writer for the Grateful Dead, advocated for a separate legal regime for cyberspace, totally outside of state control.¹⁶¹ Barlow and others believed that cyberspace was “a new frontier, where people lived in peace, under their own rules, liberated from the constraints of an oppressive society and free from government meddling.”¹⁶² After President Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act into law, Barlow wrote his famous *Declaration of Cyberspace Independence*, based on the Declaration of Independence, and distributed it widely.¹⁶³ “Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone... You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one... Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions... We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”¹⁶⁴ “The belief that cyberspace should be free from government interference, or sovereignty, led to the idea that cyberspace is, in fact, immune from state sovereignty.”¹⁶⁵ However, this ideal has become very unrealistic. Although cyberspace was once believed to be free from government control and regulation, States are being to exert their control over cyberspace in order to ensure liberty.¹⁶⁶ As a result, sovereignty needs to apply in cyberspace. “We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.”¹⁶⁷ States will have to want to exert sovereignty in cyberspace and in order to do this there will have to be borders in cyberspace. How States construct these borders is another matter.¹⁶⁸ --- ¹⁶¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 17; see also Franzese, supra note 86, at 11–12.\n¹⁶² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 13.\n¹⁶³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 19–20 (explaining that the Communications Decency Act “punished all transmission of ‘indecent’ sexual communications or images on the Internet ‘in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age’”).\n¹⁶⁴ John Perry Barlow, *A Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace* (Feb. 8, 1996), http://www.homes.eff.org/-barlow/Declaration-Final.html.\n¹⁶⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 11.\n¹⁶⁶ LESSIG, supra note 65, at 3.\n¹⁶⁷ LESSIG, supra note 65, at 4.\n¹⁶⁸ See Forrest Hare, *Borders in Cyberspace: Can Sovereignty Adapt to the Challenges of Cyber Security*, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 88, 101–03 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/06_HARE_Borders%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE Over the last decade, States have begun exerting their sovereignty in cyberspace in response to complaints from its citizens and a need to control the information seen by those citizens. Western States have exerted control on content or access to content in order to protect their citizens from child pornography, sale of Nazi paraphernalia, and other ills.¹⁶⁹ States have also had to regulate content on the Internet in order to safeguard intellectual property. Repressive states such as China and Belarus have constructed barriers to access in an effort to keep western ideals of democracy from its citizens' purview on the Internet.¹⁷⁰ As far back as 1995, the Germans prosecuted the German manager of CompuServe Deutschland for\"failing to prevent child pornography, much of which came from outside Germany, from reaching German citizens.\"¹⁷¹ Regulating local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is a key to States controlling what content its citizens can view on the Internet. Once notified of the existence of illegal content, German, British, and French laws require their local ISPs to screen out the offending content.¹⁷² This protects the citizens of those States, but it does not stop the offending content from transiting the States' cyberspace.\nPrior to 2000, it was believed that a State could not control an Internet provider in another State.¹⁷³ In a landmark decision, the French courts held that Yahoo, a United States corporation, violated French law by allowing Nazi paraphernalia to appear for sale on web pages accessible in France.¹⁷⁴ Acknowledging that a one hundred percent blockage was impossible, the court\"ordered Yahoo to make a 'reasonable effort' to block French users.\"¹⁷⁵ France was not blocking the websites from its cyberspace, but it was erecting a border around its citizens whom it wanted to protect from the Nazi goods being sold.\nAlthough China allows access to the Internet, it has carefully engineered accessible content. China\"is trying to create an Internet that is free enough to support and maintain the world's fastest growing economy, and yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on power.\"¹⁷⁶ In order to accomplish this goal, China has created a\"firewall\"popularly known as the\"Great Firewall of China\"around its people that filters and removes any unapproved information headed to a Chinese national.¹⁷⁷ In 2002, Yahoo signed the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, which requires that\"Yahoo filter materials that might be harmful or threat- --- ¹⁶⁹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 154–57.\n¹⁷⁰ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 87–104; ACCESS CONTROLLED: THE SHAPING OF POWER, RIGHTS, AND RULE IN CYBERSPACE 161–69, 449–73 (Ronald Deibert et al. eds., 2010); LESSIG, supra note 65, at 79–80, 308; see generally Fyodor Pavlyuchenko, Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 156, 156–62 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., Kenneth Geers trans. 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/11_PAVLYUCHENKO_Belorussia.pdf (censorship).\n¹⁷¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n¹⁷² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n¹⁷³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 1–10.\n¹⁷⁴ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 7–8.\n¹⁷⁵ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 8.\n¹⁷⁶ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 89.\n¹⁷⁷ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 92–93 (outlining the process by which the\"Great Firewall of China\"filters unapproved internet information); ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 ening to Party rule.”¹⁷⁸ These processes, however, do not prevent the data from actually entering China. Thus, determined savvy Internet users are able to circumvent most, if not all, of these barriers with relative ease.¹⁷⁹ E-commerce requires a stable environment controlled by a sovereign who can protect companies and consumers from fraud. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, desired to make a company self-regulated by its users, but “quickly learned that to prevent fraud, enforce its contracts, and ensure stability in its auction services, it would depend critically on government coercion and the rule of law provided by a stable country like the United States.”¹⁸⁰ Originally run by community enforcement, eBay now has a full-time security staff of over eight hundred people.¹⁸¹ States are creating boundaries in cyberspace to protect its citizens, rather than its territory. Cyber crimes are being prosecuted by States regardless of the fact that the person was not physically within the State’s territory when accessing the Internet. The United States prosecutes a man who views child pornography on the Internet while physically being in another country by using extra-territorial jurisdiction.¹⁸² “Developing sovereignty, [however,] ultimately requires an international regime with specific rules and procedures regulating state activity in that domain, including a requirement to identify and track transnational actors.”¹⁸³ iii. A Navigational Regime for Cyberspace – Transit Passage As with the domains of sea, air, and space, there is a need for international space in cyberspace. “And like the seas, the U.S. will feel the need to maintain ‘freedom of navigation’ in cyberspace as a primary beneficiary of its existence.”¹⁸⁴ The networks of cyberspace need to be kept “open for the economic, social, and security interests of this country and its citizens.”¹⁸⁵ Cyberspace has provided an information-based revolution in the public, private, and military sectors.¹⁸⁶ This domain, however, is very different from the other physical domains. A State may not even be aware of someone in their cyberspace. Cyber operations occur “at computing speeds delivered at the speed of light.”¹⁸⁷ In order to physically enter a State, a traveler must present a passport; yet a cyber traveler can enter any State in cyberspace without any documents. This freedom is not something that we want to stop with the recognition of sovereignty in cyberspace. Therefore, international law needs to adopt a regime for cyberspace that allows for the free flow of electrons through all of cyberspace.\n¹⁷⁸ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 9.\n¹⁷⁹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 103; ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\n¹⁸⁰ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129.\n¹⁸¹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129–135.\n¹⁸² LESSIG, supra note 65, at 299.\n¹⁸³ Franzese, supra note 86, at 34 (emphasizing that because cyberspace is man-made, it is necessarily influenced by politics and shaped by social actions and institutions); see also Geoffrey L. Herrera, Cyberspace and Sovereignty: Thoughts on Physical Space and Digital Space (Mar. 22, 2006), http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p98069_index.html.\n¹⁸⁴ Matus, supra note 5, at 33 (noting that this issues will require “significant strategic changes to U.S. national security”).\n¹⁸⁵ Huntley, supra note 18, at 2 (asserting that, in order to keep these cyberspace networks open, the United States must also conduct operations in cyberspace).\n¹⁸⁶ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 56.\n¹⁸⁷ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 52.\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE “[T]ransit passage allows all ships and aircraft freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the international strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.”¹⁹¹ Cyberspace absolutely requires this type of framework in order not to disrupt the flow of ideas and commerce in cyberspace. “Transit passage” would allow the electrons to transit cyberspace in their normal mode of operation. No State could suspend transit passage of its cyberspace; but if it so chose, it could disconnect from the network. In addition, transit passage would apply to military operations and would allow for the transit passage through a neutral territory. The hardware, however, is actually in sovereign territory. The relationship between the physical hardware and cyberspace is similar to that of territorial waters and the high seas.\n“Every component of every information and telecommunications network around the world, under the sea, and in the air is subject to proprietary interests – whether that of a private company, a sovereign government, or possibly both. Each copper wire, fiber-optic cable, microwave relay tower, satellite transponder, or Internet router has been produced or installed by some entity whose legal successors not only maintain ownership of that physical asset but also expect protection of the same by sovereign authorities.”¹⁹² Recognizing a right of “transit passage” in cyberspace would merely make current State practice customary international law. Every day, States violate the sovereignty of other States as emails from one office transit across national boundaries in route to the office next door. Because of the way the Internet operates, one message can be broken up into multiple packets that travel the public Internet in the most expeditious manner regardless of path. Cyberspace knows no boundaries; packets do not request permission when transiting from one State to another.\n¹⁸⁸ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 51.\n¹⁸⁹ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 58; see also Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, and Benjamin Tilly, Metcalf’s Law is Wrong, IEEE SPECTRUM, http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-iswrong.\n¹⁹⁰ Ryan et al., supra note 76, at 89.\n¹⁹¹ Barney, supra note 159, at 75.\n¹⁹² Kanuck, supra note 20, at 1573.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 Private password protected networks in cyberspace should be treated as internal waters, where complete territorial sovereignty is imposed. Information from unauthorized users on these networks would violate territorial sovereignty. The Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) would be one example of such network. This type of regime would balance society's need for freedom of navigation of cyberspace while protecting national security.\nSovereignty in cyberspace is required and States will need to exert this sovereignty. It is imperative that States police crime, protect property interest, and take action against known attacks originating within its cyberspace.^[193]^ Global society is heavily reliant on the Internet's continuing functionality, which requires packets to continue surfing freely through cyberspace. In addition, States cannot currently exert territorial control over the electrons passing through its cyberspace; therefore, there is no way to enforce exclusive sovereignty in cyberspace. Consequently, States should operate in cyberspace, assuming a right of\"transit passage,\"and, with time, the practice will become a part of customary international law.",

Additional Protocol I requires a State to review any “new weapon, means or method of warfare to ensure its employment would not violate international law.”²⁰⁰ What activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force is the subject of much debate. “At a point along the spectrum of interstate activities called the line of belligerency, a use of force by a state establishes an international armed conflict as a matter of law and the law of armed conflict applies.”²⁰¹ Jus ad bellum is this body of international law, found in both customary and treaty law, governing a State’s resort to force against another state.²⁰² The UN Charter is the primary modern source of jus ad bellum.²⁰³ In accordance with the UN Charter, “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”²⁰⁴ In order to know what activities between states are forbidden in cyberspace, we must know what activities constitute the threat or use of force in cyberspace. In Article 51, the UN Charter offers that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”²⁰⁵ Humanity must determine what an armed attack is in cyberspace in order to know when a state has a right to protect itself. “Although a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense [under Article 51] in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.”²⁰⁶ applicabilityofihltocna.pdf (applying international humanitarian law); Dunlap, supra note 21, at 81–95 (arguing basic tenets of LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT are sufficient to address cyberwar); Todd, supra note 3, at 66–102 (arguing for a definition-based approach); David E.

Defining the Use of Force/Armed Attack in Cyberspace Without defining any of the terms individually, the UN Charter uses the terms “use of force,” “armed attack,” and “aggression” in its various provisions, spurring over fifty years of debate about the terms’ meanings.²⁰⁷ Although economic and political coercion can threaten international stability, generally the use of force is understood to mean armed force.²⁰⁸ “Until the advent of information operations, most coercion could be handily categorized into one of several boxes, for few options existed that could not be typed as political, economic, or armed in nature.”²⁰⁹ Cyber attacks, however, do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Cyber attacks are launched for a multitude of reasons with a wide spectrum of effects. Therefore, it had to be determined “whether a cyber attack, because it does not involve the use of kinetic force, is a prohibited use of force under the Charter and customary international law.”²¹⁰ Michael N. Schmitt analyzed this and answered it in the affirmative, stating “the key is to move from an instrument-based paradigm (economics, politics, kinetic military force) to one based on the consequences caused by the action.”²¹¹ To help analyze the consequences of an operation, Schmitt developed seven criteria to determine whether the effects are “more like those caused by economic and political coercion or by physical coercion.”²¹² In defining the use of force in cyberspace, most scholars look to the seven-factor analysis proposed by Michael N. Schmitt to determine a use of force.²¹³ These factors include: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and State responsibility²¹⁴ and give a qualitative analysis of how military operations differ from nonmilitary operations, such as diplomatic and economic coercion.²¹⁵ The use of force does not include non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare.²¹⁶ The next major law of armed conflict issue is evaluating when a cyber attack amounts to an “armed attack” under Article 51, allowing a State to respond with force in self-defense.²¹⁷ The previous analysis is not applicable in this determination, because “use of force” and “armed attack” is not the same.²¹⁸ Typically, cyber attacks with violent effects are the legally equivalent to armed attacks.²¹⁹ Therefore, cyber attacks utilizing cyber weapons (e.g., viruses, worms, logic bombs) and resulting in human suffering or property damage (beyond the computer program or data attacked) can be\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE",
    "## V. NEUTRALITY": "The designers created the Internet, as implied by its name, to be a single network to link data across States and oceans.²²⁵ In reality, the Internet is a multitude of different linked networks.²²⁶ Therefore, there is no way to predict the State or States through which a packet will travel during transmission.²²⁷ A belligerent cannot know which route its cyber attack will take on its way to its target, which makes it impossible to ensure that it does not cross a neutral’s cyberspace territory.²²⁸\nIn a cyberwar, how a State remains neutral has been the subject of much discourse. The primary question is whether an electron from a belligerent State crossing through a neutral State’s cyberspace territory is a violation of the law of neutrality.²²⁹ Another question is whether a neutral State is required to take action against a belligerent electron transiting its cyberspace. “More than a century after the Hague Conventions’ enactment, their general conception of neutrality remains controlling law, but international law does not explicitly address cyberattacks and cyber neutrality.”²³⁰ This paper argues that an electron passing through a neutral’s State’s cyberspace does not violate the neutral’s sovereignty and should not require action by the neutral State.²³¹ Since it appears that there is not go-\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 ing to be any new international agreements written for cyberspace in the near future, it is imperative to interpret the existing rules in the most appropriate fashion. “Because international law imposes a dramatically different legal status on states that enter conflicts between other states as a belligerent, compared with states electing to remain neutral, the choice between belligerency and neutrality represents one of the most significant responsibilities for a sovereign’s national security decision-making body.”²³² ## A. The Law of Neutrality The law of neutrality embodied in the Hague Conventions is basically as old as time, in the sense it is based on basic economic principles. Neutrals want to stay out of war and yet want to protect their commerce and trade routes. Belligerents need resources, which neutrals have. Since the law of neutrality has endured with little change through all of the technological revolutions of the last several centuries, there is no reason to believe the same law will not apply in cyberspace, where commerce along with communication is paramount.",
    "## i. History of Neutrality As early as the fourteenth century and possibly even earlier, “neutrality” was applied in its modern sense.²³³ Since at least the fifteenth century, a prime objective of belligerents was the destruction of the enemy’s trade, which appears to have led to the law of neutral rights at sea.²³⁴ The problem has always been the reconciliation of the incompatible interests of neutrals and belligerents, or, rather, a compromise between these irreconcilable interests. The neutral has sought to maintain his freedom of trade; the belligerent has sought to cut off all supplies from his enemy. The desire to seize goods of the enemy may be HUMANITARIAN LAW RESEARCH INITIATIVE, COMPUTERS AND WAR: THE LEGAL BATTLESPACE 15 (2004), (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University), http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf (asserting the mere routing of data through a neutral State is allowed), with LAWRENCE T.

Therefore, there must be an international armed conflict in order for the law of neutrality to apply.²⁴⁰ Hague Convention III Relative To the Opening of Hostilities governs the beginning of hostilities. With regards to neutral states, Hague Convention III states: The existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware of the existence of a state of war.²⁴¹ These provisions will limit the application of neutrality law to cyberwarfare. Thus far, no States have taken responsibility for any cyber attacks.\nIn circumstances where a cyber attack rises to the level of a cyberwar,²⁴² the States involved in the conflict would need to be identified. In accordance with Hague Convention III, the parties to conflict would need to notify neutral States. Until that time, a neutral State would not be bound by the obligations of Hague Convention V, unless they should have known about the conflict. Even if a cyber attack is deemed an\"armed attack,\"generally the identity of the attacker is unknown. In such ²³⁵ Id. at xii.\n²³⁶ Id.\n²³⁷ Id. at xiii.

The movement of troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies by belligerents across the territory of a neutral state is forbidden.²⁴³ Belligerents are forbidden from erecting wireless telegraphy stations or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea on the territory of a neutral state.²⁴⁴ They are further prohibited from using any of such stations erected prior to the war on the territory of a neutral state for purely military purposes, unless it has been opened for the service of public messages.²⁴⁵ These prohibitions apply only to direct communications by belligerents to their forces.²⁴⁶ A neutral State has a responsibility to prohibit such activity from being conducted on its territory.²⁴⁷ Certainly, belligerents may not launch an attack from within the telecommunication infrastructure of a neutral State.²⁴⁸ There is an exception, however, to this principle of information warfare.\na. Telegraph Exception A neutral State is allowed to let belligerents use telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to the neutral State or its nationals.²⁴⁹ The neutral State does, however, have to ensure any restrictions or prohibitions are applied impartially to both belligerents.²⁵⁰ The same applies for private infrastructure systems.²⁵¹ If this is the case, a belligerent may utilize the State's telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.²⁵² The level of State activism by the neutral, though, may range; the greater the degree of activism, the more likely it is a neutral State will violate its duties under the law of neutrality.²⁵³ It is one thing for private companies of a neutral State to conduct commerce with a belligerent State, and another for the State itself to assist a belligerent.²⁵⁴ As long as a neutral State impartially makes its networks available to both sides, there is no reason ²⁴³ Hague Convention V Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 18 October 1907, art. 2 [hereinafter Hague V].\n²⁴⁴ Id. art. 3(a).\n²⁴⁵ Id. art. 3(b).\n²⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 195, at 208.\n²⁴⁷ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 5.\n²⁴⁸ Schmitt et al., supra note 231, at 15.\n²⁴⁹ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 8.\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 9.\n²⁵¹ Brown, supra note 195, at 208 (explaining why there is no duty on neutral states to restrict belligerents from using its own communications systems or privately owned systems, so long as the neutral state and the privately owned systems are impartial).\n²⁵² Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n²⁵³ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (stating the more active a State is in helping a belligerent, the more likely it is violating the law of neutrality); see infra Part VI.\n²⁵⁴ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83; see generally L.

    "## b. Law of the Seas “Peaceful Passage”": "Hague Convention XIII governs the rights and duties of neutral States in naval war.²⁵⁷ The provisions are similar to those on land, but “the neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of war-ships or prizes belonging to belligerents.”²⁵⁸ Belligerent war-ships can remain in a port or territorial water of a neutral state for up to twenty-four hours.²⁵⁹\nIn addition to Hague XIII, the Law of the Sea Convention provides more guidance to neutrals and belligerents in regards to the different navigational regimes.²⁶⁰ In international straits, it protects the right of transit passage, even through neutral straits.²⁶¹ Belligerent forces transiting a neutral international strait must refrain from hostile activities not incident to their transit, but they may “take defensive measures consistent with their security, including the launching and recovery of military devices, screen formation steaming, and acoustic and electronic surveillance, and may respond in self-defense to a hostile act or hostile intent.”²⁶² Once again, analogizing cyberspace to an international strait results in a potentially practical rule for international law.\nDue to the way the Internet is structured, it is foolhardy to prohibit a cyber weapon to peacefully pass through a neutral State’s cyberspace. In most situations, the neutral State will not even know that the electrons passed through its sovereignty.²⁶³ Nor is there much the State can do, short of severing all computer connections with other States.",
    "## B. Responsibility of a Neutral": "Some scholars argue that a neutral must keep electrons from a belligerent from transiting its cyberspace.²⁶⁴ These same scholars suggest that a neutral will lose its protected status if it fails to meet this impossible burden.\nUnder this rule, if a neutral state cannot or does not take action to halt a cyber attack, a belligerent may choose to counter by physically attacking the neutral state’s commu\n²⁵⁵ SCHMITT ET AL., *supra* note 231, at 15 (adding that if a neutral state does not act impartially, the “victim” belligerent may take necessary and proportionate steps to end the violation).\n²⁵⁶ TIKK ET AL., *supra* note 18, at 83.\n²⁵⁷ Hague Convention XIII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 18 October 1907.\n²⁵⁸ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 10.\n²⁵⁹ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 12.\n²⁶⁰ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n²⁶¹ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4 (caveating the idea that a neutral nation may suspend passage of belligerent warships through its territorial seas).\n²⁶² COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n²⁶³ See Kelsey, *supra* note 28, at 1444–45 (considering the scope of the duty of neutrality; specifically, whether neutral states hold the practical methods of detecting a cyber attack).\n²⁶⁴ Kastenberg, *supra* note 26, at 56 (“A surrender of neutrality or acquiescence to belligerent activity may draw a neutral state into the conflict”).\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nnications infrastructure. Thus, even without the physical violation of a neutral state's territory, a cyber attack may force a neutral state to become unwillingly involved.²⁶⁵\nWhy should we espouse such an impossible burden on neutrals? Nothing in the Hague Conventions suggests that a State must defend against anything less than a physical invasion of its territory. The Hague Conventions allow for warships to pass through territorial waters of a neutral and for the usage of telecommunication infrastructure. Jeffrey Kelsey in *Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare* argues that the meaning of neutrality should evolve to an “intent-based view of neutrality” so that neutrals are able to escape an impossible burden.²⁶⁶ “This view would not require the neutral state to take action to prevent the unintentional passage of the cyber weapons through its borders . . .”²⁶⁷ This is the right answer, but international law already allows for this.\nIt is an entirely different situation where a neutral State allows a belligerent to conduct attacks from its cyberspace.²⁶⁸ In these cases, the neutral needs to aggressively pursue those committing these attacks or face attack upon its own network. A neutral must also ensure that its servers are not being used for command and control of belligerent fighters. In such a case, “the server might be a valid military target because it’s being used for the communications or command and control of the enemy fighters in the areas of hostilities.”²⁶⁹ “Although every server has a physical location, the Internet is not segmented along national borders, and the enemy may gain greater tactical advantage from a server hosted half way around the world than from one located right in the middle of hostilities.²⁷⁰\nNeutrals will have to remain vigilant that belligerents do not use the servers located in their sovereign territory for command and control, or face being subject to attack. International law, however, must acknowledge that cyberspace falls under the telegraph exception to the law of neutrality, allowing electrons to freely transit cyberspace. One must remember that the law of neutrality only applies in an actual international armed conflict in cyberspace. Just because there is an international armed conflict on the ground does not necessarily mean there is a conflict in cyberspace, triggering the law of neutrality. The next section applies these concepts to the cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008.",

Issues of Sovereignty Before considering whether the law of neutrality was violated or whether it even applied, one must look at issues of sovereignty. Since both Tulip and Google hosted Georgian websites on their servers, one can assume that Georgian citizens at least accessed these websites, if not interacted with them. These sites were on servers located in the United States without the consent of the United States government. Therefore, Georgian citizens violated the sovereignty of the United States every time they accessed these websites.²⁹¹ Unless of course, there is a right of\"transit passage,\"which would allow nationals of one State to freely transit the cyberspace of other States without the express permission of the sovereign.",
    "## B. Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks Assuming a right of\"transit passage\"exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality²⁹² because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks.²⁹³ The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic.²⁹⁴\"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\"²⁹⁵ Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.²⁹⁶": "Vol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\nIn fact, a self-appointed representatives of the Russian hacker underground claimed responsibility for a “Stop Georgia” website, which was set up to coordinate some of the cyber attacks on Georgian websites.²⁹⁸ When cyber attacks cannot be sufficiently linked to ongoing hostilities, the cyber attacks cannot take on the legal classification of the physical conflict. At this point, the cyber attacks must go through their own analysis.\nIn the end, the damage was minimal — email disruptions and website unavailability.²⁹⁹ The damages were further limited by the low interconnectivity of the country.³⁰⁰ “The main damage was in limiting the nation’s possibilities to distribute information about the ongoing military conflict, in ‘making its voice heard’ to the world and in communicating with the Georgian people.”³⁰¹ The effects of the cyber attacks alone were not severe enough to amount to a “use of force” under Article 2(4) and certainly not enough to justify self-defense in response to an “armed attack” under Article 51³⁰² therefore, neither the law of armed conflict nor the law of neutrality applied.",
    "## C. Regardless, the Law of Neutrality Would Not Have Been Violated Even if LOAC did apply to the situation, the telegraph exception to Hague V would permit a neutral State to allow the use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.³⁰³ Of course, the level of state activism in permitting the use of telecommunications may range, from simply accepting data flow through private infrastructure to lending server space as was the case with Poland and Estonia, to actively supporting the functioning of telecommunications. Not all activities on this scale need necessarily be interpreted in a similar measure in the light of Article 8 of the Hague Convention cited above, but the smaller the degree of state activism, the less there is reason to speak of the state violating neutrality.³⁰⁴ ²⁹⁷ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.": "²⁹⁸ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁹ Kaminski, supra note 7, at 82 (distinguishing “actual damage” from the immeasurable damage that resulted from the attacks).\n³⁰⁰ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰¹ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰² Todd, supra note 16, at 91–92 (“There was no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack...

Cyber Cooperation The assistance by Poland, Estonia, and the United States companies has been described as a “cyber alliance.”³¹² This alliance limited the damages that the cyber attacks caused on Georgia.³¹³ The governments of Poland and Estonia supported Georgia with technical assistance and server space.³¹⁴ In addition, two private companies in the United States gave Georgia server space.³¹⁵ Since the cyber attacks were considered the work of hackers, it was a criminal problem.³¹⁶ As such, these attacks were separate from the international armed conflict, which was conducted on the ground in Georgia. It is in the interest of all States to have a global response to such criminal attacks. States should not be afraid to assist in such non-state sponsored cyber attacks, because they fear violating the law of neutrality. Cyber security is going to take a global effort to be effective.",

These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 The UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace,³¹⁷ this is an infeasible burden.\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure. No other interpretation of the law of neutrality is feasible in cyberspace. A fear of violating the law of neutrality should not hinder State action in cyberspace.\n³¹⁷ Any future change that would allow one to control the path the packets of a message travel would destroy packet switching, one of the founding principles of the Internet."

It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself. From a more technical point of view, this is scarcely true because in its modern meaning \"neutrality\" is a legal status involving certain rights and duties. It therefore contemplates the existence of some sort of international legal system.\n# I.

Among the differing definitions of cyberspace, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) defines cyberspace as “[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”\nAlthough DoD has a definition of cyberspace, it is at times paralyzed in conducting cyber operations due to a lack of any international agreement or even understanding on the application of sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, and neutrality in cyberspace. “[M]ilitary strategists argue that these uncertainties have led to excess caution on the part of Pentagon planners” who are “tremendously sensitive to collateral damage by virtual weapons, but not nearly sensitive enough to damage by kinetic” ones. In October 2011, the New York Times reported that the United States debated using cyber warfare to open the campaign against Libya in March 2011, but rejected its usage in favor of kinetic strikes. In speculating on the reason behind the decision not to use cyber warfare, the article mentions “potential legal complications.” One of the impediments may have been a fear\n Frampton, supra note 4, at 13 (stating the United Nations Charter defines terms such as, an act of aggression, threat of use of force, and an armed attack in the context of Jus Ad Bellum but are silent on their application in a cyber context).\n See generally MARK WESTON JANIS, AMERICA AND THE LAW OF NATIONS 1776-1939 I-2 (2010) (arguing the law referred to as the law of nations or international law has not meant the same thing to everyone, causing fierce debates in America over international law when in reality the two sides were actually arguing over different things); Ryan T.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.” “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.” Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.” At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons. Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare. “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.” This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.\n John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated. The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful. In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations. Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it. Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.” While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status. A misguided view of the law of\n See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

It appears Stuxnet sole mission was “to attack and destroy as many of the Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges as possible thereby directly slowing down the progress of the Iranian nuclear programme.” At the Natanz nuclear research establishment, it damaged approximately 1,000 centrifuges used for Uranium enrichment. “Stuxnet may have been more effective than a conventional military attack and may have avoided a major international crisis over collateral damage.” In addition, States should not fail to aid another State in a cyber crisis out of an apprehension of losing its neutral status.\nOnce thought to be borderless and free of government control, States are transforming cyberspace by exerting their sovereignty in this new domain. Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality. Part VI wraps up analyzing how States did not lose neutral status by assisting Georgia in 2008 during its cyber crisis. Before looking at how sovereignty and the law of neutrality apply in cyberspace, it is important to understand the structure and value of the Internet.\n## II. THE CENTERPIECE OF CYBERSPACE – THE INTERNET\n“The Net negates geometry. While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.” It is not a definable or describable place. Yet, one can find things within the Internet that one did not know existed nor where they were located. “The Net is ambient – nowhere in particular but everywhere at once.” One can access the Internet by logging on from wherever one is physically located, placing oneself virtually in cyberspace while simultaneously remaining in the territorial sovereign of where one began the journey. While virtually exploring cyberspace, one seamlessly transcends into and across the cyberspace of other States. These unique characteristics pose a challenge for sovereignty. Although the Internet is only a subset of cyberspace, this paper primarily concentrates on the Internet in exploring how to create a regime for sovereignty in cyberspace. This section examines the characteristics of the Internet that will impact the choice of a regime.\n## A. The Birth of the Internet\nIn the interest of National Security, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) provided the funding and institutional support for the research that led to the development of the Internet. Despite DoD’s motives, the aspirations and vision of a unique group of electrical engineers and unorthodox computer programmers, who desired to redesign the way computers worked in order to amplify human thinking and communication, designed the Internet.

J. C. R. Licklider, a psychologist at MIT, headed the program. The DoD created ARPA with a broad mandate to fund cutting-edge research and strategically placed the Agency directly below the Secretary of Defense. “Throughout the 1960s groups at various universities and research centers were funded to work on different aspects of interactive computing and networking.” First, the research focused on enabling users to interact with a computer through a terminal, which then turned to connecting computers in different geographic locations to enable them to collaborate and share materials. In 1965, the researchers linked a computer in Massachusetts to one in California through a telephone network, but large blocks of data caused problems when they created traffic jams. A packet-switching network, which “allows for faster travel speeds, a higher volume of information, and permits the system to withstand additional stresses,” still utilized today, turned out to be the solution.\nIn the fall of 1969 at UCLA, the first computer network, ARPANET, was born. It was deliberately designed with “a distributed, redundant structure so that it could survive partial nuclear destruction and the knockout of military headquarters.” By the end of that year, four host computers connected approximately one thousand researchers around the country. The network got bigger and bigger and was utilized more for sending messages than its original purpose of sharing expensive resources among the different research centers. In 1975, the military became interested in the network and began using it for communication.

The Backbone of the Internet\nThe Internet is a very large system of interconnected networks “with significant built-in capacity to resist concentrations of power and authoritarian control.”60 It is a packet-switching network, which distributes messages by breaking them up into smaller addressed packets that follow independent routes to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original message.61 Instead of a central control, independent routers ensure “the addressed packets flow around saturated channels.”62 Not only does this system provide improved efficiency, it provides a more secure system of communication.63 “If one node goes down, the network reroutes around it.”64 Depending on the demand at any given time, packets travel on the most efficient path, causing there to be no predictable paths of travel.65 There is also no way of prohibiting a packet from traveling on an open network of a particular State.66 One message, depending on size, can be divided up into multitude of packets, which all theoretically can travel on a different path through the cyberspace of different sovereign\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nDifferent computers and networks are able to communicate with each other because they were all designed to use the same universal language, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). ARPA required the use of this common language, which spread because of its open design and its freely available software and documentation.\nNo single entity — academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit — administers the Internet. It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers . . . There is no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.\nA great deal of the functionality of the Internet is attributed to the end-to-end principle, which network architects, Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David Clark, used as their guiding principle in designing the Internet.\nRather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network — to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network's core. The core is kept as simple as possible.\nSo any changes to the architecture of the Internet such as authentication or content filtering should not be done by changes to the network itself, but rather by applications attached to the network.\nThe backbone of the Internet being the packet-switching network and the common language of TCP/IP is essential to maintain the current interoperable Internet. In the interest of cyber security, commercial and governmental organizations utilize firewalls to protect themselves from the evils lurking on the Internet. These firewalls are applications that keep computers safe from some attacks and prevent some websites from being seen, but they do not stop the flow of electrons on the network, which crosses all State boundaries.\n See WALKER, supra note 56, at 1095.\n See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61.\n See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61 (“The Internet became the network of networks using this protocol.”).\n ACLU v.

World-wide Dependence on the Internet\nSince its humble beginnings in a research lab in 1969, “cyberspace has grown and spread to become a commons, a critical infrastructure that is pervasive and upon which societies worldwide have become dependent for commerce, recreation, communication, delivery of government services, research, education and a host of other activities.”76 A key qualification to being a major State power today is Internet connectivity.77 In order to survive as a State and remain economically competitive, States have to embrace the Internet and continue to build the infrastructure that it requires.78 The global networking of high speed information processing systems are “made possible by the ground based international telecommunications infrastructure and a growing constellation of satellites which provide countries with a means to acquire and transmit information.”79\nIn 2010, global Internet usage was over 2 billion people.80 Most States have public facilities, such as libraries and Internet cafés, where people can log onto the Internet for free.81 “U.S. and international businesses trade goods and services in cyberspace, moving assets across the globe in seconds. In addition to facilitating trade in other sectors, cyberspace is itself a key sector of the global economy.”82 Around the world, States’ critical infrastructures such as power distribution, telecommunications, banking, emergency services, transportation, national defense, and more are becoming ever dependent on the efficiencies offered by cyberspace.83 Stock exchanges and Air Traffic Control around the world are linked and dependent on the cyber infrastructure.84 Cyberspace has become the seas of commerce and the backbone of our global society, which demands a regime of sovereignty that will ensure the free flow of electrons currently enjoyed on the Internet.\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\n“To Aristotle the idea of a placeless, borderless community would have seemed very strange; it appeared self-evident to him that a state — a self-governing political unit — had a definite, bounded territory in which the citizens lived and over which they exerted control.”85 Defining what constitutes sovereignty, however, is very difficult.86 Sovereignty is defined as “1. Supreme dominion, authority or rule. 2. The supreme political authority of an independent state. 3. The state itself.”87 The definition does not specify what sovereignty includes. In Article 2(4), the Charter of the United Nations speaks of protecting territorial integrity, “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”88 “Preserving state sovereignty is a vital goal of both state-based international organizations and individual countries.”89 Sovereignty, however, is treated differently in each physical domain, striking a balance between States’ interests and global needs.\n## A. The Essence of Sovereignty\n“Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nhis natural liberty and absolute right to anything that tempts him and that he can take; what he gains by the social contract is civil liberty and the legal right of property in what he possesses.”\nA domain is an area where control is exerted. “Since classical times, two domains of operation dominated military and civilian operations: land and sea.” With the development of powered flight in 1904, the domain of air became a new possibility. Finally in 1955, the birth of the “space age” opened the last physical domain, space, but it was not until the 1980s that “the US DoD acknowledged outer space as a fourth war fighting domain.” Even after the international community recognized each of these domains, it took time for States to create specifically tailored treaties for each domain to address sovereignty.\nNow the world community needs to address the development of cyberspace and how sovereignty should relate to this new domain, which is like no other for it is man-made and does not physically exist. Although once thought to be merely an enhancement to the other existing domains, the concept of cyberspace as its own domain was recently accepted. Even though cyberspace is very different from the other naturally occurring domains, it does share some similarities.\n## B. Sovereignty in the Physical Domains\n“The global reach of the Internet, a network of networks, leads some to assume it is ungovernable since it reaches beyond national borders.” Similar concerns existed when mankind entered the domains of air and space.\nWhen states and individuals started developing the technological capability to enter the domains of sea, air, and outer space, strong arguments existed for each of these domains to remain free from sovereign control. However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.\n See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65.\n Patrick D.

Land\nOriginally, principles of sovereignty were about controlling territory and the people in it. “During the 17th century, the concept of sovereigns as individual monarchs gave way to the Westphalian state system of governments as sovereigns.” Since the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the international system has been dominated by the State actor, which holds exclusive authority over the land and people within its geographic boundary. “Under [this] traditional understanding of sovereignty, [States] occupy a territorially-defined physical locus, such that ‘sovereignty’ and ‘country’ are inextricably intertwined. [States] are defined by the territory they control, and [States] possess exclusive authority over events within their borders.” Before long, States had to decide on a regime for the seas.\nii. Sea\nThe seas, which cover “two-thirds of the world’s surface,” originally were not controlled or owned. Over time, this led way to the high seas being open to all with sovereign States only exerting control over the territorial seas bordering its country. “The evolution of the law can be seen as a response to, and a reconciliation of, the conflicting interests of the Members of the international\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 29 (noting that this reliance on state practices “means that a change in state interests or technological capabilities might change the legal status of these domains”).\n J.

In 1625, Grotius determined the territorial sea to be an area in which a state could exert control over those sailing on it, as it could control someone on its land. Cornelius van Bynkershoek adopted this principle in 1702. \"In those times, the coastal [S]tate was able to exercise control over the sea within the range of a canon shot, namely, three miles. The three-mile limit has become thus the traditional breadth of the territorial sea.\" By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was a principle of international law that the high seas were free and open while States could exert sovereignty in their territorial waters.\nSince early times, the law of the sea has had to balance conflicting economic, political, and strategic interests among States. \"With the geometric expansion of international trade following World War II . . . and the increasing awareness of interdependence among the nations of the free world, the importance of the freedom of the seas and navigation in their waters and airspace were reemphasized.\" This concept of sovereignty was first codified in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas, and culminated in 1982 with the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which established national and international waters and airspace. National waters include a State's internal waters and its territorial seas. It set the territorial seas as twelve nautical miles from the States' shores. The international waters include the contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and the high seas. \"Ships and aircraft enjoy high seas freedoms,\" which include freedom of navigation and overflight of international waters.\nAlthough sovereignty is recognized in the territorial waters of a State, UNCLOS III provides for the \"innocent\" passage of ships, not aircraft, through these waters \"for the purpose of continuous and expeditious traversing of the territorial sea\" as long as \"it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.\" The Convention prohibits the launch and recovery of aircraft and any exercise with weapons while a ship is conducting innocent passage, considering these\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nIn straits used for international navigation, UNCLOS III provides for the right of “transit passage,” “freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.” During “transit passage,” ships and submarines can transit in their normal mode of operation. Bordering States are not allowed to suspend transit passage. The Convention carefully balances a State’s need for security with the world’s needs for the freedom of navigation of the seas for commerce and trade. It is a balance like this that the new domain of cyberspace requires.\niii. Air\nLike cyberspace, the air was initially thought to be common to all. With the rise of property rights, the belief that the owner of the land also owned the air above it became the law. The concept of air sovereignty came with the age of flight, and international law regarding air sovereignty started with state practice. “The actions of various states throughout World War I, especially neutral countries’ refusal to allow overflight, firmly established air sovereignty as customary international law by the end of the war.” The first codification was in 1919 in the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation in France, commonly known as the Paris Convention. It established exclusive sovereignty in the air, but it made an exception for the right of innocent passage across the airspace. The final codification was in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Chicago Convention, which states: “the contracting States recognize that every\n UNCLOS III, supra note 120, at pt.

Outer Space\nWith the dawn of rockets and satellites, the world had to decide how high up a State’s sovereignty goes. Some argued that it extended indefinitely, but this was not practical given the laws of planetary science and the lack of ability to exert control in space. “Sovereignty can only truly exist if states can exert control, or sovereignty over the areas they claim.” Prior to the launching of satellites and the beginning of actual space research in 1957, no sovereign conducted activity in outer space, thus precluding any effective control over outer space and the celestial bodies. The United States and the Soviet Union were the first States to conduct actual research in outer space, but neither State made any territorial claim. In 1958, the two States came to an early agreement to prohibit territorial sovereignty over outer space. United States policy makers “faced the challenge to develop policy that protected Space for peaceful purposes for the good of all mankind, while at the same time that responded to the potential Armageddon-like conflict in the frigid, biting reality of the Cold War arms race.”\nThe Outer Space Treaty of 1967 codifies the legal status of outer space as free from sovereignty. China, however, is challenging this principle and arguing that their sovereignty extends into outer space, because there is no definition of where territorial air space ends and outer space begins. Even though the Treaty provides that exploration in space is supposed to be for peace-\n The Convention on International Civil Aviation, Dec. 7, 1944, pt. I, ch.

The domains are global in scope and indifferent to physical terrain or lines drawn on a map with near instantaneous effects transmitted through their domains. Both cyber and space are global commons vital to civil and commercial activities and essential to the economy and military operations.”\nOne major difference, however, is the ease of accessibility of cyberspace versus space. A Master’s thesis from 1965 once asked: “where is space? [W]ho controls it?” These are the same questions that we ask today about cyberspace.\n## C. Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nCyberspace needs the rule of law inherent in sovereignty, but it needs to be open for international transit. “As with maritime trade, the path to future prosperity relies on open access, engagement and cooperation among friends and allies in the global cyberspace commons.” Although similar to space, cyberspace cannot be a true global commons “governed collectively for the common benefit of all mankind,” effectively prohibiting State sovereignty. The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms. “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.” A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance.\n Robert W.

Utopian Beginnings\nIn the 1990s, John Perry Barlow, lyrics writer for the Grateful Dead, advocated for a separate legal regime for cyberspace, totally outside of state control. Barlow and others believed that cyberspace was “a new frontier, where people lived in peace, under their own rules, liberated from the constraints of an oppressive society and free from government meddling.” After President Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act into law, Barlow wrote his famous *Declaration of Cyberspace Independence*, based on the Declaration of Independence, and distributed it widely.\n“Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone . . . You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one . . . Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions . . . We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”\n“The belief that cyberspace should be free from government interference, or sovereignty, led to the idea that cyberspace is, in fact, immune from state sovereignty.” However, this ideal has become very unrealistic. Although cyberspace was once believed to be free from government control and regulation, States are being to exert their control over cyberspace in order to ensure liberty. As a result, sovereignty needs to apply in cyberspace. “We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.” States will have to want to exert sovereignty in cyberspace and in order to do this there will have to be borders in cyberspace. How States construct these borders is another matter.\n---\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 17; see also Franzese, supra note 86, at 11–12.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 13.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 19–20 (explaining that the Communications Decency Act “punished all transmission of ‘indecent’ sexual communications or images on the Internet ‘in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age’”).\n John Perry Barlow, *A Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace* (Feb. 8, 1996), http://www.homes.eff.org/-barlow/Declaration-Final.html.\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 11.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 3.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 4.\n See Forrest Hare, *Borders in Cyberspace: Can Sovereignty Adapt to the Challenges of Cyber Security*, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 88, 101–03 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/06_HARE_Borders%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nOver the last decade, States have begun exerting their sovereignty in cyberspace in response to complaints from its citizens and a need to control the information seen by those citizens. Western States have exerted control on content or access to content in order to protect their citizens from child pornography, sale of Nazi paraphernalia, and other ills. States have also had to regulate content on the Internet in order to safeguard intellectual property. Repressive states such as China and Belarus have constructed barriers to access in an effort to keep western ideals of democracy from its citizens' purview on the Internet.\nAs far back as 1995, the Germans prosecuted the German manager of CompuServe Deutschland for \"failing to prevent child pornography, much of which came from outside Germany, from reaching German citizens.\" Regulating local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is a key to States controlling what content its citizens can view on the Internet. Once notified of the existence of illegal content, German, British, and French laws require their local ISPs to screen out the offending content. This protects the citizens of those States, but it does not stop the offending content from transiting the States' cyberspace.\nPrior to 2000, it was believed that a State could not control an Internet provider in another State. In a landmark decision, the French courts held that Yahoo, a United States corporation, violated French law by allowing Nazi paraphernalia to appear for sale on web pages accessible in France. Acknowledging that a one hundred percent blockage was impossible, the court \"ordered Yahoo to make a 'reasonable effort' to block French users.\" France was not blocking the websites from its cyberspace, but it was erecting a border around its citizens whom it wanted to protect from the Nazi goods being sold.\nAlthough China allows access to the Internet, it has carefully engineered accessible content. China \"is trying to create an Internet that is free enough to support and maintain the world's fastest growing economy, and yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on power.\" In order to accomplish this goal, China has created a \"firewall\" popularly known as the \"Great Firewall of China\" around its people that filters and removes any unapproved information headed to a Chinese national. In 2002, Yahoo signed the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, which requires that \"Yahoo filter materials that might be harmful or threat-\n---\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 154–57.\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 87–104; ACCESS CONTROLLED: THE SHAPING OF POWER, RIGHTS, AND RULE IN CYBERSPACE 161–69, 449–73 (Ronald Deibert et al. eds., 2010); LESSIG, supra note 65, at 79–80, 308; see generally Fyodor Pavlyuchenko, Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 156, 156–62 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., Kenneth Geers trans. 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/11_PAVLYUCHENKO_Belorussia.pdf (censorship).\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 1–10.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 7–8.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 8.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 89.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 92–93 (outlining the process by which the \"Great Firewall of China\" filters unapproved internet information); ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nening to Party rule.” These processes, however, do not prevent the data from actually entering China. Thus, determined savvy Internet users are able to circumvent most, if not all, of these barriers with relative ease.\nE-commerce requires a stable environment controlled by a sovereign who can protect companies and consumers from fraud. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, desired to make a company self-regulated by its users, but “quickly learned that to prevent fraud, enforce its contracts, and ensure stability in its auction services, it would depend critically on government coercion and the rule of law provided by a stable country like the United States.” Originally run by community enforcement, eBay now has a full-time security staff of over eight hundred people.\nStates are creating boundaries in cyberspace to protect its citizens, rather than its territory. Cyber crimes are being prosecuted by States regardless of the fact that the person was not physically within the State’s territory when accessing the Internet. The United States prosecutes a man who views child pornography on the Internet while physically being in another country by using extra-territorial jurisdiction. “Developing sovereignty, [however,] ultimately requires an international regime with specific rules and procedures regulating state activity in that domain, including a requirement to identify and track transnational actors.”\niii. A Navigational Regime for Cyberspace – Transit Passage\nAs with the domains of sea, air, and space, there is a need for international space in cyberspace. “And like the seas, the U.S. will feel the need to maintain ‘freedom of navigation’ in cyberspace as a primary beneficiary of its existence.” The networks of cyberspace need to be kept “open for the economic, social, and security interests of this country and its citizens.” Cyberspace has provided an information-based revolution in the public, private, and military sectors.\nThis domain, however, is very different from the other physical domains. A State may not even be aware of someone in their cyberspace. Cyber operations occur “at computing speeds delivered at the speed of light.” In order to physically enter a State, a traveler must present a passport; yet a cyber traveler can enter any State in cyberspace without any documents. This freedom is not something that we want to stop with the recognition of sovereignty in cyberspace. Therefore, international law needs to adopt a regime for cyberspace that allows for the free flow of electrons through all of cyberspace.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 9.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 103; ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129.\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129–135.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 299.\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 34 (emphasizing that because cyberspace is man-made, it is necessarily influenced by politics and shaped by social actions and institutions); see also Geoffrey L.

No State could suspend transit passage of its cyberspace; but if it so chose, it could disconnect from the network. In addition, transit passage would apply to military operations and would allow for the transit passage through a neutral territory. The hardware, however, is actually in sovereign territory. The relationship between the physical hardware and cyberspace is similar to that of territorial waters and the high seas.\n“Every component of every information and telecommunications network around the world, under the sea, and in the air is subject to proprietary interests – whether that of a private company, a sovereign government, or possibly both. Each copper wire, fiber-optic cable, microwave relay tower, satellite transponder, or Internet router has been produced or installed by some entity whose legal successors not only maintain ownership of that physical asset but also expect protection of the same by sovereign authorities.”\nRecognizing a right of “transit passage” in cyberspace would merely make current State practice customary international law. Every day, States violate the sovereignty of other States as emails from one office transit across national boundaries in route to the office next door. Because of the way the Internet operates, one message can be broken up into multiple packets that travel the public Internet in the most expeditious manner regardless of path. Cyberspace knows no boundaries; packets do not request permission when transiting from one State to another.\n Sorensen, supra note 8, at 51.\n Sorensen, supra note 8, at 58; see also Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, and Benjamin Tilly, Metcalf’s Law is Wrong, IEEE SPECTRUM (July 2006), http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-iswrong.\n Ryan et al., supra note 76, at 89.\n Barney, supra note 159, at 75.\n Kanuck, supra note 20, at 1573.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nPrivate password protected networks in cyberspace should be treated as internal waters, where complete territorial sovereignty is imposed. Information from unauthorized users on these networks would violate territorial sovereignty. The Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) would be one example of such network. This type of regime would balance society's need for freedom of navigation of cyberspace while protecting national security.\nSovereignty in cyberspace is required and States will need to exert this sovereignty. It is imperative that States police crime, protect property interest, and take action against known attacks originating within its cyberspace.^[193]^ Global society is heavily reliant on the Internet's continuing functionality, which requires packets to continue surfing freely through cyberspace. In addition, States cannot currently exert territorial control over the electrons passing through its cyberspace; therefore, there is no way to enforce exclusive sovereignty in cyberspace. Consequently, States should operate in cyberspace, assuming a right of \"transit passage,\" and, with time, the practice will become a part of customary international law.\n## IV. APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT TO CYBERSPACE\nThe governance of cyberspace will require the utilization of all types of law, such as criminal law, tort law, and property law. Since cyberspace interconnects global society, it most assuredly will require international law. As long as cyberwar is possible, the international body of law known as the law of armed conflict^[194]^ will apply to cyberspace.\n## A.

Therefore, law of armed conflict does not directly apply to cyberspace and does not take into account all of the differences between cyberwarfare and traditional kinetic warfare; instead, it must be applied through analogy. In addition, Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention extends the law of armed conflict to any new method of warfare. Additional Protocol I requires a State to review any “new weapon, means or method of warfare to ensure its employment would not violate international law.”\nWhat activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force is the subject of much debate. “At a point along the spectrum of interstate activities called the line of belligerency, a use of force by a state establishes an international armed conflict as a matter of law and the law of armed conflict applies.” Jus ad bellum is this body of international law, found in both customary and treaty law, governing a State’s resort to force against another state. The UN Charter is the primary modern source of jus ad bellum. In accordance with the UN Charter, “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” In order to know what activities between states are forbidden in cyberspace, we must know what activities constitute the threat or use of force in cyberspace. In Article 51, the UN Charter offers that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.” Humanity must determine what an armed attack is in cyberspace in order to know when a state has a right to protect itself. “Although a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense [under Article 51] in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.”\napplicabilityofihltocna.pdf (applying international humanitarian law); Dunlap, supra note 21, at 81–95 (arguing basic tenets of LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT are sufficient to address cyberwar); Todd, supra note 3, at 66–102 (arguing for a definition-based approach); David E.

Defining the Use of Force/Armed Attack in Cyberspace\nWithout defining any of the terms individually, the UN Charter uses the terms “use of force,” “armed attack,” and “aggression” in its various provisions, spurring over fifty years of debate about the terms’ meanings. Although economic and political coercion can threaten international stability, generally the use of force is understood to mean armed force. “Until the advent of information operations, most coercion could be handily categorized into one of several boxes, for few options existed that could not be typed as political, economic, or armed in nature.” Cyber attacks, however, do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Cyber attacks are launched for a multitude of reasons with a wide spectrum of effects. Therefore, it had to be determined “whether a cyber attack, because it does not involve the use of kinetic force, is a prohibited use of force under the Charter and customary international law.” Michael N. Schmitt analyzed this and answered it in the affirmative, stating “the key is to move from an instrument-based paradigm (economics, politics, kinetic military force) to one based on the consequences caused by the action.” To help analyze the consequences of an operation, Schmitt developed seven criteria to determine whether the effects are “more like those caused by economic and political coercion or by physical coercion.”\nIn defining the use of force in cyberspace, most scholars look to the seven-factor analysis proposed by Michael N. Schmitt to determine a use of force. These factors include: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and State responsibility and give a qualitative analysis of how military operations differ from nonmilitary operations, such as diplomatic and economic coercion. The use of force does not include non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare.\nThe next major law of armed conflict issue is evaluating when a cyber attack amounts to an “armed attack” under Article 51, allowing a State to respond with force in self-defense. The previous analysis is not applicable in this determination, because “use of force” and “armed attack” is not the same. Typically, cyber attacks with violent effects are the legally equivalent to armed attacks. Therefore, cyber attacks utilizing cyber weapons (e.g., viruses, worms, logic bombs) and resulting in human suffering or property damage (beyond the computer program or data attacked) can be\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\n## V. NEUTRALITY\nThe designers created the Internet, as implied by its name, to be a single network to link data across States and oceans. In reality, the Internet is a multitude of different linked networks. Therefore, there is no way to predict the State or States through which a packet will travel during transmission. A belligerent cannot know which route its cyber attack will take on its way to its target, which makes it impossible to ensure that it does not cross a neutral’s cyberspace territory.\nIn a cyberwar, how a State remains neutral has been the subject of much discourse. The primary question is whether an electron from a belligerent State crossing through a neutral State’s cyberspace territory is a violation of the law of neutrality. Another question is whether a neutral State is required to take action against a belligerent electron transiting its cyberspace. “More than a century after the Hague Conventions’ enactment, their general conception of neutrality remains controlling law, but international law does not explicitly address cyberattacks and cyber neutrality.” This paper argues that an electron passing through a neutral’s State’s cyberspace does not violate the neutral’s sovereignty and should not require action by the neutral State. Since it appears that there is not go-\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\ning to be any new international agreements written for cyberspace in the near future, it is imperative to interpret the existing rules in the most appropriate fashion. “Because international law imposes a dramatically different legal status on states that enter conflicts between other states as a belligerent, compared with states electing to remain neutral, the choice between belligerency and neutrality represents one of the most significant responsibilities for a sovereign’s national security decision-making body.”\n## A. The Law of Neutrality\nThe law of neutrality embodied in the Hague Conventions is basically as old as time, in the sense it is based on basic economic principles. Neutrals want to stay out of war and yet want to protect their commerce and trade routes. Belligerents need resources, which neutrals have. Since the law of neutrality has endured with little change through all of the technological revolutions of the last several centuries, there is no reason to believe the same law will not apply in cyberspace, where commerce along with communication is paramount.\n## i. History of Neutrality\nAs early as the fourteenth century and possibly even earlier, “neutrality” was applied in its modern sense. Since at least the fifteenth century, a prime objective of belligerents was the destruction of the enemy’s trade, which appears to have led to the law of neutral rights at sea.\nThe problem has always been the reconciliation of the incompatible interests of neutrals and belligerents, or, rather, a compromise between these irreconcilable interests. The neutral has sought to maintain his freedom of trade; the belligerent has sought to cut off all supplies from his enemy. The desire to seize goods of the enemy may be\nHUMANITARIAN LAW RESEARCH INITIATIVE, COMPUTERS AND WAR: THE LEGAL BATTLESPACE 15 (2004), (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University), http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf (asserting the mere routing of data through a neutral State is allowed), with LAWRENCE T.

Resources required by belligerents have served neutral states well through time. Although neutrals have long complained about breaches of the law of neutrality, it appears through history that these neutral States have netted far more gains than losses.\nii. 1907 Hague Convention V\nThe Hague Convention V Respecting The Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land and in the Hague Convention XII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War embody the international law on neutrality. Per the titles of these conventions, they apply in the case of war. Therefore, there must be an international armed conflict in order for the law of neutrality to apply. Hague Convention III Relative To the Opening of Hostilities governs the beginning of hostilities. With regards to neutral states, Hague Convention III states:\nThe existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware of the existence of a state of war.\nThese provisions will limit the application of neutrality law to cyberwarfare. Thus far, no States have taken responsibility for any cyber attacks.\nIn circumstances where a cyber attack rises to the level of a cyberwar, the States involved in the conflict would need to be identified. In accordance with Hague Convention III, the parties to conflict would need to notify neutral States. Until that time, a neutral State would not be bound by the obligations of Hague Convention V, unless they should have known about the conflict. Even if a cyber attack is deemed an \"armed attack,\" generally the identity of the attacker is unknown. In such\n Id. at xii.\n Id.\n Id. at xiii.

The movement of troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies by belligerents across the territory of a neutral state is forbidden. Belligerents are forbidden from erecting wireless telegraphy stations or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea on the territory of a neutral state. They are further prohibited from using any of such stations erected prior to the war on the territory of a neutral state for purely military purposes, unless it has been opened for the service of public messages. These prohibitions apply only to direct communications by belligerents to their forces. A neutral State has a responsibility to prohibit such activity from being conducted on its territory. Certainly, belligerents may not launch an attack from within the telecommunication infrastructure of a neutral State. There is an exception, however, to this principle of information warfare.\na. Telegraph Exception\nA neutral State is allowed to let belligerents use telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to the neutral State or its nationals. The neutral State does, however, have to ensure any restrictions or prohibitions are applied impartially to both belligerents. The same applies for private infrastructure systems. If this is the case, a belligerent may utilize the State's telecommunications infrastructure and equipment. The level of State activism by the neutral, though, may range; the greater the degree of activism, the more likely it is a neutral State will violate its duties under the law of neutrality. It is one thing for private companies of a neutral State to conduct commerce with a belligerent State, and another for the State itself to assist a belligerent. As long as a neutral State impartially makes its networks available to both sides, there is no reason\n Hague Convention V Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 18 October 1907, art. 2 [hereinafter Hague V].\n Id. art. 3(a).\n Id. art. 3(b).\n Brown, supra note 195, at 208.\n Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 5.\n Schmitt et al., supra note 231, at 15.\n Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 8.\n Id. art. 9.\n Brown, supra note 195, at 208 (explaining why there is no duty on neutral states to restrict belligerents from using its own communications systems or privately owned systems, so long as the neutral state and the privately owned systems are impartial).\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (stating the more active a State is in helping a belligerent, the more likely it is violating the law of neutrality); see infra Part VI.\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83; see generally L.

Law of the Seas “Peaceful Passage”\nHague Convention XIII governs the rights and duties of neutral States in naval war. The provisions are similar to those on land, but “the neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of war-ships or prizes belonging to belligerents.” Belligerent war-ships can remain in a port or territorial water of a neutral state for up to twenty-four hours.\nIn addition to Hague XIII, the Law of the Sea Convention provides more guidance to neutrals and belligerents in regards to the different navigational regimes. In international straits, it protects the right of transit passage, even through neutral straits. Belligerent forces transiting a neutral international strait must refrain from hostile activities not incident to their transit, but they may “take defensive measures consistent with their security, including the launching and recovery of military devices, screen formation steaming, and acoustic and electronic surveillance, and may respond in self-defense to a hostile act or hostile intent.” Once again, analogizing cyberspace to an international strait results in a potentially practical rule for international law.\nDue to the way the Internet is structured, it is foolhardy to prohibit a cyber weapon to peacefully pass through a neutral State’s cyberspace. In most situations, the neutral State will not even know that the electrons passed through its sovereignty. Nor is there much the State can do, short of severing all computer connections with other States.\n## B. Responsibility of a Neutral\nSome scholars argue that a neutral must keep electrons from a belligerent from transiting its cyberspace. These same scholars suggest that a neutral will lose its protected status if it fails to meet this impossible burden.\nUnder this rule, if a neutral state cannot or does not take action to halt a cyber attack, a belligerent may choose to counter by physically attacking the neutral state’s commu\n SCHMITT ET AL., *supra* note 231, at 15 (adding that if a neutral state does not act impartially, the “victim” belligerent may take necessary and proportionate steps to end the violation).\n TIKK ET AL., *supra* note 18, at 83.\n Hague Convention XIII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 18 October 1907.\n Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 10.\n Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 12.\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4 (caveating the idea that a neutral nation may suspend passage of belligerent warships through its territorial seas).\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n See Kelsey, *supra* note 28, at 1444–45 (considering the scope of the duty of neutrality; specifically, whether neutral states hold the practical methods of detecting a cyber attack).\n Kastenberg, *supra* note 26, at 56 (“A surrender of neutrality or acquiescence to belligerent activity may draw a neutral state into the conflict”).\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nnications infrastructure. Thus, even without the physical violation of a neutral state's territory, a cyber attack may force a neutral state to become unwillingly involved.\nWhy should we espouse such an impossible burden on neutrals? Nothing in the Hague Conventions suggests that a State must defend against anything less than a physical invasion of its territory. The Hague Conventions allow for warships to pass through territorial waters of a neutral and for the usage of telecommunication infrastructure. Jeffrey Kelsey in *Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare* argues that the meaning of neutrality should evolve to an “intent-based view of neutrality” so that neutrals are able to escape an impossible burden. “This view would not require the neutral state to take action to prevent the unintentional passage of the cyber weapons through its borders . . .” This is the right answer, but international law already allows for this.\nIt is an entirely different situation where a neutral State allows a belligerent to conduct attacks from its cyberspace. In these cases, the neutral needs to aggressively pursue those committing these attacks or face attack upon its own network. A neutral must also ensure that its servers are not being used for command and control of belligerent fighters. In such a case, “the server might be a valid military target because it’s being used for the communications or command and control of the enemy fighters in the areas of hostilities.” “Although every server has a physical location, the Internet is not segmented along national borders, and the enemy may gain greater tactical advantage from a server hosted half way around the world than from one located right in the middle of hostilities.\nNeutrals will have to remain vigilant that belligerents do not use the servers located in their sovereign territory for command and control, or face being subject to attack. International law, however, must acknowledge that cyberspace falls under the telegraph exception to the law of neutrality, allowing electrons to freely transit cyberspace. One must remember that the law of neutrality only applies in an actual international armed conflict in cyberspace. Just because there is an international armed conflict on the ground does not necessarily mean there is a conflict in cyberspace, triggering the law of neutrality. The next section applies these concepts to the cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008.\n## VI. CASE STUDY – CYBER ATTACKS ON GEORGIA (JULY/AUGUST 2008)\nIn the summer of 2008, attacks on Georgian government websites coincided with an actual military ground conflict.

These countries have better cyber security and were able to prevent an information blockade of Georgia. Private U.S. technology companies, unbeknownst to the United States government, allowed Georgia to use their servers for news and governmental services, not military operations. The Estonian government allowed the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hang on a server in their country and the President of Poland hosted official press releases from the Georgian government on a section of their website.

Issues of Sovereignty\nBefore considering whether the law of neutrality was violated or whether it even applied, one must look at issues of sovereignty. Since both Tulip and Google hosted Georgian websites on their servers, one can assume that Georgian citizens at least accessed these websites, if not interacted with them. These sites were on servers located in the United States without the consent of the United States government. Therefore, Georgian citizens violated the sovereignty of the United States every time they accessed these websites. Unless of course, there is a right of \"transit passage,\" which would allow nationals of one State to freely transit the cyberspace of other States without the express permission of the sovereign.\n## B. Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks\nAssuming a right of \"transit passage\" exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks. The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic. \"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\" Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nIn fact, a self-appointed representatives of the Russian hacker underground claimed responsibility for a “Stop Georgia” website, which was set up to coordinate some of the cyber attacks on Georgian websites. When cyber attacks cannot be sufficiently linked to ongoing hostilities, the cyber attacks cannot take on the legal classification of the physical conflict. At this point, the cyber attacks must go through their own analysis.\nIn the end, the damage was minimal — email disruptions and website unavailability. The damages were further limited by the low interconnectivity of the country. “The main damage was in limiting the nation’s possibilities to distribute information about the ongoing military conflict, in ‘making its voice heard’ to the world and in communicating with the Georgian people.” The effects of the cyber attacks alone were not severe enough to amount to a “use of force” under Article 2(4) and certainly not enough to justify self-defense in response to an “armed attack” under Article 51 therefore, neither the law of armed conflict nor the law of neutrality applied.\n## C. Regardless, the Law of Neutrality Would Not Have Been Violated\nEven if LOAC did apply to the situation, the telegraph exception to Hague V would permit a neutral State to allow the use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.\nOf course, the level of state activism in permitting the use of telecommunications may range, from simply accepting data flow through private infrastructure to lending server space as was the case with Poland and Estonia, to actively supporting the functioning of telecommunications. Not all activities on this scale need necessarily be interpreted in a similar measure in the light of Article 8 of the Hague Convention cited above, but the smaller the degree of state activism, the less there is reason to speak of the state violating neutrality.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n Kaminski, supra note 7, at 82 (distinguishing “actual damage” from the immeasurable damage that resulted from the attacks).\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n Todd, supra note 16, at 91–92 (“There was no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack . . . The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy.”).\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nIn addition, the cyber attacks were not military operations since Russia denied all involvement and there was no actual evidence to the contrary. Therefore, the actions of the neutral States could not have interfered with military operations. Georgia also treated the cyber attacks as a computer security issue, rather than as cyberwarfare. The website that the neutral States assisted with were communication outlets and not military in nature.\nFinally, Hague V requires that if a neutral State allows the use of its telecommunications infrastructure by belligerents, it must do so impartially. Russia never requested any similar assistance; therefore, there is no evidence of impartiality. Consequently, even if the law of armed conflict applied to the cyber attack in Georgia, the assisting States did nothing in violation of the law of neutrality.\n## D. Cyber Cooperation\nThe assistance by Poland, Estonia, and the United States companies has been described as a “cyber alliance.” This alliance limited the damages that the cyber attacks caused on Georgia. The governments of Poland and Estonia supported Georgia with technical assistance and server space. In addition, two private companies in the United States gave Georgia server space. Since the cyber attacks were considered the work of hackers, it was a criminal problem. As such, these attacks were separate from the international armed conflict, which was conducted on the ground in Georgia. It is in the interest of all States to have a global response to such criminal attacks. States should not be afraid to assist in such non-state sponsored cyber attacks, because they fear violating the law of neutrality. Cyber security is going to take a global effort to be effective.\n## VII. CONCLUSION\nThe designers of the Internet were utopians, who created a decentralized network to withstand nuclear attack, intending it to be a domain free of government control. They believed that this new parallel world could escape the evils of government. The designers envisioned new communities\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nWith time, however, cyberspace succumbed to human nature and its malfeasance. Citizens are now looking to their sovereigns to police the bad acts occurring in cyberspace. As e-commerce has exploded in cyberspace, companies also want the protections offered by a sovereign such as stability and preservation of property rights. The free flow of information has threatened the existence of other sovereigns, who control their people through restricting and molding the information available to their citizenry.\nAs States exert control in cyberspace, borders are forming in cyberspace. These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nThe UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace, this is an infeasible burden.\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure. No other interpretation of the law of neutrality is feasible in cyberspace. A fear of violating the law of neutrality should not hinder State action in cyberspace.\n Any future change that would allow one to control the path the packets of a message travel would destroy packet switching, one of the founding principles of the Internet.",

It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself. From a more technical point of view, this is scarcely true because in its modern meaning \"neutrality\" is a legal status involving certain rights and duties. It therefore contemplates the existence of some sort of international legal system.\n# I.

Among the differing definitions of cyberspace, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) defines cyberspace as “[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”\nAlthough DoD has a definition of cyberspace, it is at times paralyzed in conducting cyber operations due to a lack of any international agreement or even understanding on the application of sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, and neutrality in cyberspace. “[M]ilitary strategists argue that these uncertainties have led to excess caution on the part of Pentagon planners” who are “tremendously sensitive to collateral damage by virtual weapons, but not nearly sensitive enough to damage by kinetic” ones. In October 2011, the New York Times reported that the United States debated using cyber warfare to open the campaign against Libya in March 2011, but rejected its usage in favor of kinetic strikes. In speculating on the reason behind the decision not to use cyber warfare, the article mentions “potential legal complications.” One of the impediments may have been a fear\n Frampton, supra note 4, at 13 (stating the United Nations Charter defines terms such as, an act of aggression, threat of use of force, and an armed attack in the context of Jus Ad Bellum but are silent on their application in a cyber context).\n See generally MARK WESTON JANIS, AMERICA AND THE LAW OF NATIONS 1776-1939 I-2 (2010) (arguing the law referred to as the law of nations or international law has not meant the same thing to everyone, causing fierce debates in America over international law when in reality the two sides were actually arguing over different things); Ryan T.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.” “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.” Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.” At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons. Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare. “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.” This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.\n John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

In a situation where the “use of force” amounts to an “armed attack,” Article 51 allows a State to legally respond in self-defense with force. See U.N. Charter art. 51. If the State responds with force against the other State, there will be an international armed conflict as referred to in Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions and a state of war as referred to in the Hague Conventions.

However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated. The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful. In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations. Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it. Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.” While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status. A misguided view of the law of\n See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

It appears Stuxnet sole mission was “to attack and destroy as many of the Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges as possible thereby directly slowing down the progress of the Iranian nuclear programme.” At the Natanz nuclear research establishment, it damaged approximately 1,000 centrifuges used for Uranium enrichment. “Stuxnet may have been more effective than a conventional military attack and may have avoided a major international crisis over collateral damage.” In addition, States should not fail to aid another State in a cyber crisis out of an apprehension of losing its neutral status.\nOnce thought to be borderless and free of government control, States are transforming cyberspace by exerting their sovereignty in this new domain. Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality. Part VI wraps up analyzing how States did not lose neutral status by assisting Georgia in 2008 during its cyber crisis. Before looking at how sovereignty and the law of neutrality apply in cyberspace, it is important to understand the structure and value of the Internet.\n## II. THE CENTERPIECE OF CYBERSPACE – THE INTERNET\n“The Net negates geometry. While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.” It is not a definable or describable place. Yet, one can find things within the Internet that one did not know existed nor where they were located. “The Net is ambient – nowhere in particular but everywhere at once.” One can access the Internet by logging on from wherever one is physically located, placing oneself virtually in cyberspace while simultaneously remaining in the territorial sovereign of where one began the journey. While virtually exploring cyberspace, one seamlessly transcends into and across the cyberspace of other States. These unique characteristics pose a challenge for sovereignty. Although the Internet is only a subset of cyberspace, this paper primarily concentrates on the Internet in exploring how to create a regime for sovereignty in cyberspace. This section examines the characteristics of the Internet that will impact the choice of a regime.\n## A. The Birth of the Internet\nIn the interest of National Security, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) provided the funding and institutional support for the research that led to the development of the Internet. Despite DoD’s motives, the aspirations and vision of a unique group of electrical engineers and unorthodox computer programmers, who desired to redesign the way computers worked in order to amplify human thinking and communication, designed the Internet.

J. C. R. Licklider, a psychologist at MIT, headed the program. The DoD created ARPA with a broad mandate to fund cutting-edge research and strategically placed the Agency directly below the Secretary of Defense. “Throughout the 1960s groups at various universities and research centers were funded to work on different aspects of interactive computing and networking.” First, the research focused on enabling users to interact with a computer through a terminal, which then turned to connecting computers in different geographic locations to enable them to collaborate and share materials. In 1965, the researchers linked a computer in Massachusetts to one in California through a telephone network, but large blocks of data caused problems when they created traffic jams. A packet-switching network, which “allows for faster travel speeds, a higher volume of information, and permits the system to withstand additional stresses,” still utilized today, turned out to be the solution.\nIn the fall of 1969 at UCLA, the first computer network, ARPANET, was born. It was deliberately designed with “a distributed, redundant structure so that it could survive partial nuclear destruction and the knockout of military headquarters.” By the end of that year, four host computers connected approximately one thousand researchers around the country. The network got bigger and bigger and was utilized more for sending messages than its original purpose of sharing expensive resources among the different research centers. In 1975, the military became interested in the network and began using it for communication.

The Backbone of the Internet\nThe Internet is a very large system of interconnected networks “with significant built-in capacity to resist concentrations of power and authoritarian control.”60 It is a packet-switching network, which distributes messages by breaking them up into smaller addressed packets that follow independent routes to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original message.61 Instead of a central control, independent routers ensure “the addressed packets flow around saturated channels.”62 Not only does this system provide improved efficiency, it provides a more secure system of communication.63 “If one node goes down, the network reroutes around it.”64 Depending on the demand at any given time, packets travel on the most efficient path, causing there to be no predictable paths of travel.65 There is also no way of prohibiting a packet from traveling on an open network of a particular State.66 One message, depending on size, can be divided up into multitude of packets, which all theoretically can travel on a different path through the cyberspace of different sovereign\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nDifferent computers and networks are able to communicate with each other because they were all designed to use the same universal language, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). ARPA required the use of this common language, which spread because of its open design and its freely available software and documentation.\nNo single entity — academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit — administers the Internet. It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers . . . There is no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.\nA great deal of the functionality of the Internet is attributed to the end-to-end principle, which network architects, Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David Clark, used as their guiding principle in designing the Internet.\nRather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network — to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network's core. The core is kept as simple as possible.\nSo any changes to the architecture of the Internet such as authentication or content filtering should not be done by changes to the network itself, but rather by applications attached to the network.\nThe backbone of the Internet being the packet-switching network and the common language of TCP/IP is essential to maintain the current interoperable Internet. In the interest of cyber security, commercial and governmental organizations utilize firewalls to protect themselves from the evils lurking on the Internet. These firewalls are applications that keep computers safe from some attacks and prevent some websites from being seen, but they do not stop the flow of electrons on the network, which crosses all State boundaries.\n See WALKER, supra note 56, at 1095.\n See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61.\n See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61 (“The Internet became the network of networks using this protocol.”).\n ACLU v.

World-wide Dependence on the Internet\nSince its humble beginnings in a research lab in 1969, “cyberspace has grown and spread to become a commons, a critical infrastructure that is pervasive and upon which societies worldwide have become dependent for commerce, recreation, communication, delivery of government services, research, education and a host of other activities.”76 A key qualification to being a major State power today is Internet connectivity.77 In order to survive as a State and remain economically competitive, States have to embrace the Internet and continue to build the infrastructure that it requires.78 The global networking of high speed information processing systems are “made possible by the ground based international telecommunications infrastructure and a growing constellation of satellites which provide countries with a means to acquire and transmit information.”79\nIn 2010, global Internet usage was over 2 billion people.80 Most States have public facilities, such as libraries and Internet cafés, where people can log onto the Internet for free.81 “U.S. and international businesses trade goods and services in cyberspace, moving assets across the globe in seconds. In addition to facilitating trade in other sectors, cyberspace is itself a key sector of the global economy.”82 Around the world, States’ critical infrastructures such as power distribution, telecommunications, banking, emergency services, transportation, national defense, and more are becoming ever dependent on the efficiencies offered by cyberspace.83 Stock exchanges and Air Traffic Control around the world are linked and dependent on the cyber infrastructure.84 Cyberspace has become the seas of commerce and the backbone of our global society, which demands a regime of sovereignty that will ensure the free flow of electrons currently enjoyed on the Internet.\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\n“To Aristotle the idea of a placeless, borderless community would have seemed very strange; it appeared self-evident to him that a state — a self-governing political unit — had a definite, bounded territory in which the citizens lived and over which they exerted control.”85 Defining what constitutes sovereignty, however, is very difficult.86 Sovereignty is defined as “1. Supreme dominion, authority or rule. 2. The supreme political authority of an independent state. 3. The state itself.”87 The definition does not specify what sovereignty includes. In Article 2(4), the Charter of the United Nations speaks of protecting territorial integrity, “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”88 “Preserving state sovereignty is a vital goal of both state-based international organizations and individual countries.”89 Sovereignty, however, is treated differently in each physical domain, striking a balance between States’ interests and global needs.\n## A. The Essence of Sovereignty\n“Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nhis natural liberty and absolute right to anything that tempts him and that he can take; what he gains by the social contract is civil liberty and the legal right of property in what he possesses.”\nA domain is an area where control is exerted. “Since classical times, two domains of operation dominated military and civilian operations: land and sea.” With the development of powered flight in 1904, the domain of air became a new possibility. Finally in 1955, the birth of the “space age” opened the last physical domain, space, but it was not until the 1980s that “the US DoD acknowledged outer space as a fourth war fighting domain.” Even after the international community recognized each of these domains, it took time for States to create specifically tailored treaties for each domain to address sovereignty.\nNow the world community needs to address the development of cyberspace and how sovereignty should relate to this new domain, which is like no other for it is man-made and does not physically exist. Although once thought to be merely an enhancement to the other existing domains, the concept of cyberspace as its own domain was recently accepted. Even though cyberspace is very different from the other naturally occurring domains, it does share some similarities.\n## B. Sovereignty in the Physical Domains\n“The global reach of the Internet, a network of networks, leads some to assume it is ungovernable since it reaches beyond national borders.” Similar concerns existed when mankind entered the domains of air and space.\nWhen states and individuals started developing the technological capability to enter the domains of sea, air, and outer space, strong arguments existed for each of these domains to remain free from sovereign control. However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.\n See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65.\n Patrick D.

Land\nOriginally, principles of sovereignty were about controlling territory and the people in it. “During the 17th century, the concept of sovereigns as individual monarchs gave way to the Westphalian state system of governments as sovereigns.” Since the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the international system has been dominated by the State actor, which holds exclusive authority over the land and people within its geographic boundary. “Under [this] traditional understanding of sovereignty, [States] occupy a territorially-defined physical locus, such that ‘sovereignty’ and ‘country’ are inextricably intertwined. [States] are defined by the territory they control, and [States] possess exclusive authority over events within their borders.” Before long, States had to decide on a regime for the seas.\nii. Sea\nThe seas, which cover “two-thirds of the world’s surface,” originally were not controlled or owned. Over time, this led way to the high seas being open to all with sovereign States only exerting control over the territorial seas bordering its country. “The evolution of the law can be seen as a response to, and a reconciliation of, the conflicting interests of the Members of the international\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 29 (noting that this reliance on state practices “means that a change in state interests or technological capabilities might change the legal status of these domains”).\n J.

In 1625, Grotius determined the territorial sea to be an area in which a state could exert control over those sailing on it, as it could control someone on its land. Cornelius van Bynkershoek adopted this principle in 1702. \"In those times, the coastal [S]tate was able to exercise control over the sea within the range of a canon shot, namely, three miles. The three-mile limit has become thus the traditional breadth of the territorial sea.\" By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was a principle of international law that the high seas were free and open while States could exert sovereignty in their territorial waters.\nSince early times, the law of the sea has had to balance conflicting economic, political, and strategic interests among States. \"With the geometric expansion of international trade following World War II . . . and the increasing awareness of interdependence among the nations of the free world, the importance of the freedom of the seas and navigation in their waters and airspace were reemphasized.\" This concept of sovereignty was first codified in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas, and culminated in 1982 with the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which established national and international waters and airspace. National waters include a State's internal waters and its territorial seas. It set the territorial seas as twelve nautical miles from the States' shores. The international waters include the contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and the high seas. \"Ships and aircraft enjoy high seas freedoms,\" which include freedom of navigation and overflight of international waters.\nAlthough sovereignty is recognized in the territorial waters of a State, UNCLOS III provides for the \"innocent\" passage of ships, not aircraft, through these waters \"for the purpose of continuous and expeditious traversing of the territorial sea\" as long as \"it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.\" The Convention prohibits the launch and recovery of aircraft and any exercise with weapons while a ship is conducting innocent passage, considering these\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nIn straits used for international navigation, UNCLOS III provides for the right of “transit passage,” “freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.” During “transit passage,” ships and submarines can transit in their normal mode of operation. Bordering States are not allowed to suspend transit passage. The Convention carefully balances a State’s need for security with the world’s needs for the freedom of navigation of the seas for commerce and trade. It is a balance like this that the new domain of cyberspace requires.\niii. Air\nLike cyberspace, the air was initially thought to be common to all. With the rise of property rights, the belief that the owner of the land also owned the air above it became the law. The concept of air sovereignty came with the age of flight, and international law regarding air sovereignty started with state practice. “The actions of various states throughout World War I, especially neutral countries’ refusal to allow overflight, firmly established air sovereignty as customary international law by the end of the war.” The first codification was in 1919 in the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation in France, commonly known as the Paris Convention. It established exclusive sovereignty in the air, but it made an exception for the right of innocent passage across the airspace. The final codification was in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Chicago Convention, which states: “the contracting States recognize that every\n UNCLOS III, supra note 120, at pt.

Outer Space\nWith the dawn of rockets and satellites, the world had to decide how high up a State’s sovereignty goes. Some argued that it extended indefinitely, but this was not practical given the laws of planetary science and the lack of ability to exert control in space. “Sovereignty can only truly exist if states can exert control, or sovereignty over the areas they claim.” Prior to the launching of satellites and the beginning of actual space research in 1957, no sovereign conducted activity in outer space, thus precluding any effective control over outer space and the celestial bodies. The United States and the Soviet Union were the first States to conduct actual research in outer space, but neither State made any territorial claim. In 1958, the two States came to an early agreement to prohibit territorial sovereignty over outer space. United States policy makers “faced the challenge to develop policy that protected Space for peaceful purposes for the good of all mankind, while at the same time that responded to the potential Armageddon-like conflict in the frigid, biting reality of the Cold War arms race.”\nThe Outer Space Treaty of 1967 codifies the legal status of outer space as free from sovereignty. China, however, is challenging this principle and arguing that their sovereignty extends into outer space, because there is no definition of where territorial air space ends and outer space begins. Even though the Treaty provides that exploration in space is supposed to be for peace-\n The Convention on International Civil Aviation, Dec. 7, 1944, pt. I, ch.

The domains are global in scope and indifferent to physical terrain or lines drawn on a map with near instantaneous effects transmitted through their domains. Both cyber and space are global commons vital to civil and commercial activities and essential to the economy and military operations.”\nOne major difference, however, is the ease of accessibility of cyberspace versus space. A Master’s thesis from 1965 once asked: “where is space? [W]ho controls it?” These are the same questions that we ask today about cyberspace.\n## C. Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nCyberspace needs the rule of law inherent in sovereignty, but it needs to be open for international transit. “As with maritime trade, the path to future prosperity relies on open access, engagement and cooperation among friends and allies in the global cyberspace commons.” Although similar to space, cyberspace cannot be a true global commons “governed collectively for the common benefit of all mankind,” effectively prohibiting State sovereignty. The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms. “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.” A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance.\n Robert W.

Utopian Beginnings\nIn the 1990s, John Perry Barlow, lyrics writer for the Grateful Dead, advocated for a separate legal regime for cyberspace, totally outside of state control. Barlow and others believed that cyberspace was “a new frontier, where people lived in peace, under their own rules, liberated from the constraints of an oppressive society and free from government meddling.” After President Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act into law, Barlow wrote his famous *Declaration of Cyberspace Independence*, based on the Declaration of Independence, and distributed it widely.\n“Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone . . . You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one . . . Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions . . . We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”\n“The belief that cyberspace should be free from government interference, or sovereignty, led to the idea that cyberspace is, in fact, immune from state sovereignty.” However, this ideal has become very unrealistic. Although cyberspace was once believed to be free from government control and regulation, States are being to exert their control over cyberspace in order to ensure liberty. As a result, sovereignty needs to apply in cyberspace. “We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.” States will have to want to exert sovereignty in cyberspace and in order to do this there will have to be borders in cyberspace. How States construct these borders is another matter.\n---\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 17; see also Franzese, supra note 86, at 11–12.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 13.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 19–20 (explaining that the Communications Decency Act “punished all transmission of ‘indecent’ sexual communications or images on the Internet ‘in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age’”).\n John Perry Barlow, *A Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace* (Feb. 8, 1996), http://www.homes.eff.org/-barlow/Declaration-Final.html.\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 11.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 3.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 4.\n See Forrest Hare, *Borders in Cyberspace: Can Sovereignty Adapt to the Challenges of Cyber Security*, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 88, 101–03 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/06_HARE_Borders%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nOver the last decade, States have begun exerting their sovereignty in cyberspace in response to complaints from its citizens and a need to control the information seen by those citizens. Western States have exerted control on content or access to content in order to protect their citizens from child pornography, sale of Nazi paraphernalia, and other ills. States have also had to regulate content on the Internet in order to safeguard intellectual property. Repressive states such as China and Belarus have constructed barriers to access in an effort to keep western ideals of democracy from its citizens' purview on the Internet.\nAs far back as 1995, the Germans prosecuted the German manager of CompuServe Deutschland for \"failing to prevent child pornography, much of which came from outside Germany, from reaching German citizens.\" Regulating local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is a key to States controlling what content its citizens can view on the Internet. Once notified of the existence of illegal content, German, British, and French laws require their local ISPs to screen out the offending content. This protects the citizens of those States, but it does not stop the offending content from transiting the States' cyberspace.\nPrior to 2000, it was believed that a State could not control an Internet provider in another State. In a landmark decision, the French courts held that Yahoo, a United States corporation, violated French law by allowing Nazi paraphernalia to appear for sale on web pages accessible in France. Acknowledging that a one hundred percent blockage was impossible, the court \"ordered Yahoo to make a 'reasonable effort' to block French users.\" France was not blocking the websites from its cyberspace, but it was erecting a border around its citizens whom it wanted to protect from the Nazi goods being sold.\nAlthough China allows access to the Internet, it has carefully engineered accessible content. China \"is trying to create an Internet that is free enough to support and maintain the world's fastest growing economy, and yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on power.\" In order to accomplish this goal, China has created a \"firewall\" popularly known as the \"Great Firewall of China\" around its people that filters and removes any unapproved information headed to a Chinese national. In 2002, Yahoo signed the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, which requires that \"Yahoo filter materials that might be harmful or threat-\n---\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 154–57.\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 87–104; ACCESS CONTROLLED: THE SHAPING OF POWER, RIGHTS, AND RULE IN CYBERSPACE 161–69, 449–73 (Ronald Deibert et al. eds., 2010); LESSIG, supra note 65, at 79–80, 308; see generally Fyodor Pavlyuchenko, Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 156, 156–62 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., Kenneth Geers trans. 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/11_PAVLYUCHENKO_Belorussia.pdf (censorship).\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 1–10.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 7–8.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 8.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 89.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 92–93 (outlining the process by which the \"Great Firewall of China\" filters unapproved internet information); ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nening to Party rule.” These processes, however, do not prevent the data from actually entering China. Thus, determined savvy Internet users are able to circumvent most, if not all, of these barriers with relative ease.\nE-commerce requires a stable environment controlled by a sovereign who can protect companies and consumers from fraud. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, desired to make a company self-regulated by its users, but “quickly learned that to prevent fraud, enforce its contracts, and ensure stability in its auction services, it would depend critically on government coercion and the rule of law provided by a stable country like the United States.” Originally run by community enforcement, eBay now has a full-time security staff of over eight hundred people.\nStates are creating boundaries in cyberspace to protect its citizens, rather than its territory. Cyber crimes are being prosecuted by States regardless of the fact that the person was not physically within the State’s territory when accessing the Internet. The United States prosecutes a man who views child pornography on the Internet while physically being in another country by using extra-territorial jurisdiction. “Developing sovereignty, [however,] ultimately requires an international regime with specific rules and procedures regulating state activity in that domain, including a requirement to identify and track transnational actors.”\niii. A Navigational Regime for Cyberspace – Transit Passage\nAs with the domains of sea, air, and space, there is a need for international space in cyberspace. “And like the seas, the U.S. will feel the need to maintain ‘freedom of navigation’ in cyberspace as a primary beneficiary of its existence.” The networks of cyberspace need to be kept “open for the economic, social, and security interests of this country and its citizens.” Cyberspace has provided an information-based revolution in the public, private, and military sectors.\nThis domain, however, is very different from the other physical domains. A State may not even be aware of someone in their cyberspace. Cyber operations occur “at computing speeds delivered at the speed of light.” In order to physically enter a State, a traveler must present a passport; yet a cyber traveler can enter any State in cyberspace without any documents. This freedom is not something that we want to stop with the recognition of sovereignty in cyberspace. Therefore, international law needs to adopt a regime for cyberspace that allows for the free flow of electrons through all of cyberspace.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 9.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 103; ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\n GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129.\n See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129–135.\n LESSIG, supra note 65, at 299.\n Franzese, supra note 86, at 34 (emphasizing that because cyberspace is man-made, it is necessarily influenced by politics and shaped by social actions and institutions); see also Geoffrey L.

No State could suspend transit passage of its cyberspace; but if it so chose, it could disconnect from the network. In addition, transit passage would apply to military operations and would allow for the transit passage through a neutral territory. The hardware, however, is actually in sovereign territory. The relationship between the physical hardware and cyberspace is similar to that of territorial waters and the high seas.\n“Every component of every information and telecommunications network around the world, under the sea, and in the air is subject to proprietary interests – whether that of a private company, a sovereign government, or possibly both. Each copper wire, fiber-optic cable, microwave relay tower, satellite transponder, or Internet router has been produced or installed by some entity whose legal successors not only maintain ownership of that physical asset but also expect protection of the same by sovereign authorities.”\nRecognizing a right of “transit passage” in cyberspace would merely make current State practice customary international law. Every day, States violate the sovereignty of other States as emails from one office transit across national boundaries in route to the office next door. Because of the way the Internet operates, one message can be broken up into multiple packets that travel the public Internet in the most expeditious manner regardless of path. Cyberspace knows no boundaries; packets do not request permission when transiting from one State to another.\n Sorensen, supra note 8, at 51.\n Sorensen, supra note 8, at 58; see also Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, and Benjamin Tilly, Metcalf’s Law is Wrong, IEEE SPECTRUM (July 2006), http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-iswrong.\n Ryan et al., supra note 76, at 89.\n Barney, supra note 159, at 75.\n Kanuck, supra note 20, at 1573.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nPrivate password protected networks in cyberspace should be treated as internal waters, where complete territorial sovereignty is imposed. Information from unauthorized users on these networks would violate territorial sovereignty. The Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) would be one example of such network. This type of regime would balance society's need for freedom of navigation of cyberspace while protecting national security.\nSovereignty in cyberspace is required and States will need to exert this sovereignty. It is imperative that States police crime, protect property interest, and take action against known attacks originating within its cyberspace.^[193]^ Global society is heavily reliant on the Internet's continuing functionality, which requires packets to continue surfing freely through cyberspace. In addition, States cannot currently exert territorial control over the electrons passing through its cyberspace; therefore, there is no way to enforce exclusive sovereignty in cyberspace. Consequently, States should operate in cyberspace, assuming a right of \"transit passage,\" and, with time, the practice will become a part of customary international law.\n## IV. APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT TO CYBERSPACE\nThe governance of cyberspace will require the utilization of all types of law, such as criminal law, tort law, and property law. Since cyberspace interconnects global society, it most assuredly will require international law. As long as cyberwar is possible, the international body of law known as the law of armed conflict^[194]^ will apply to cyberspace.\n## A.

Therefore, law of armed conflict does not directly apply to cyberspace and does not take into account all of the differences between cyberwarfare and traditional kinetic warfare; instead, it must be applied through analogy. In addition, Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention extends the law of armed conflict to any new method of warfare. Additional Protocol I requires a State to review any “new weapon, means or method of warfare to ensure its employment would not violate international law.”\nWhat activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force is the subject of much debate. “At a point along the spectrum of interstate activities called the line of belligerency, a use of force by a state establishes an international armed conflict as a matter of law and the law of armed conflict applies.” Jus ad bellum is this body of international law, found in both customary and treaty law, governing a State’s resort to force against another state. The UN Charter is the primary modern source of jus ad bellum. In accordance with the UN Charter, “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” In order to know what activities between states are forbidden in cyberspace, we must know what activities constitute the threat or use of force in cyberspace. In Article 51, the UN Charter offers that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.” Humanity must determine what an armed attack is in cyberspace in order to know when a state has a right to protect itself. “Although a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense [under Article 51] in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.”\napplicabilityofihltocna.pdf (applying international humanitarian law); Dunlap, supra note 21, at 81–95 (arguing basic tenets of LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT are sufficient to address cyberwar); Todd, supra note 3, at 66–102 (arguing for a definition-based approach); David E.

Defining the Use of Force/Armed Attack in Cyberspace\nWithout defining any of the terms individually, the UN Charter uses the terms “use of force,” “armed attack,” and “aggression” in its various provisions, spurring over fifty years of debate about the terms’ meanings. Although economic and political coercion can threaten international stability, generally the use of force is understood to mean armed force. “Until the advent of information operations, most coercion could be handily categorized into one of several boxes, for few options existed that could not be typed as political, economic, or armed in nature.” Cyber attacks, however, do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Cyber attacks are launched for a multitude of reasons with a wide spectrum of effects. Therefore, it had to be determined “whether a cyber attack, because it does not involve the use of kinetic force, is a prohibited use of force under the Charter and customary international law.” Michael N. Schmitt analyzed this and answered it in the affirmative, stating “the key is to move from an instrument-based paradigm (economics, politics, kinetic military force) to one based on the consequences caused by the action.” To help analyze the consequences of an operation, Schmitt developed seven criteria to determine whether the effects are “more like those caused by economic and political coercion or by physical coercion.”\nIn defining the use of force in cyberspace, most scholars look to the seven-factor analysis proposed by Michael N. Schmitt to determine a use of force. These factors include: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and State responsibility and give a qualitative analysis of how military operations differ from nonmilitary operations, such as diplomatic and economic coercion. The use of force does not include non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare.\nThe next major law of armed conflict issue is evaluating when a cyber attack amounts to an “armed attack” under Article 51, allowing a State to respond with force in self-defense. The previous analysis is not applicable in this determination, because “use of force” and “armed attack” is not the same. Typically, cyber attacks with violent effects are the legally equivalent to armed attacks. Therefore, cyber attacks utilizing cyber weapons (e.g., viruses, worms, logic bombs) and resulting in human suffering or property damage (beyond the computer program or data attacked) can be\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\n## V. NEUTRALITY\nThe designers created the Internet, as implied by its name, to be a single network to link data across States and oceans. In reality, the Internet is a multitude of different linked networks. Therefore, there is no way to predict the State or States through which a packet will travel during transmission. A belligerent cannot know which route its cyber attack will take on its way to its target, which makes it impossible to ensure that it does not cross a neutral’s cyberspace territory.\nIn a cyberwar, how a State remains neutral has been the subject of much discourse. The primary question is whether an electron from a belligerent State crossing through a neutral State’s cyberspace territory is a violation of the law of neutrality. Another question is whether a neutral State is required to take action against a belligerent electron transiting its cyberspace. “More than a century after the Hague Conventions’ enactment, their general conception of neutrality remains controlling law, but international law does not explicitly address cyberattacks and cyber neutrality.” This paper argues that an electron passing through a neutral’s State’s cyberspace does not violate the neutral’s sovereignty and should not require action by the neutral State. Since it appears that there is not go-\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\ning to be any new international agreements written for cyberspace in the near future, it is imperative to interpret the existing rules in the most appropriate fashion. “Because international law imposes a dramatically different legal status on states that enter conflicts between other states as a belligerent, compared with states electing to remain neutral, the choice between belligerency and neutrality represents one of the most significant responsibilities for a sovereign’s national security decision-making body.”\n## A. The Law of Neutrality\nThe law of neutrality embodied in the Hague Conventions is basically as old as time, in the sense it is based on basic economic principles. Neutrals want to stay out of war and yet want to protect their commerce and trade routes. Belligerents need resources, which neutrals have. Since the law of neutrality has endured with little change through all of the technological revolutions of the last several centuries, there is no reason to believe the same law will not apply in cyberspace, where commerce along with communication is paramount.\n## i. History of Neutrality\nAs early as the fourteenth century and possibly even earlier, “neutrality” was applied in its modern sense. Since at least the fifteenth century, a prime objective of belligerents was the destruction of the enemy’s trade, which appears to have led to the law of neutral rights at sea.\nThe problem has always been the reconciliation of the incompatible interests of neutrals and belligerents, or, rather, a compromise between these irreconcilable interests. The neutral has sought to maintain his freedom of trade; the belligerent has sought to cut off all supplies from his enemy. The desire to seize goods of the enemy may be\nHUMANITARIAN LAW RESEARCH INITIATIVE, COMPUTERS AND WAR: THE LEGAL BATTLESPACE 15 (2004), (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University), http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf (asserting the mere routing of data through a neutral State is allowed), with LAWRENCE T.

Resources required by belligerents have served neutral states well through time. Although neutrals have long complained about breaches of the law of neutrality, it appears through history that these neutral States have netted far more gains than losses.\nii. 1907 Hague Convention V\nThe Hague Convention V Respecting The Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land and in the Hague Convention XII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War embody the international law on neutrality. Per the titles of these conventions, they apply in the case of war. Therefore, there must be an international armed conflict in order for the law of neutrality to apply. Hague Convention III Relative To the Opening of Hostilities governs the beginning of hostilities. With regards to neutral states, Hague Convention III states:\nThe existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware of the existence of a state of war.\nThese provisions will limit the application of neutrality law to cyberwarfare. Thus far, no States have taken responsibility for any cyber attacks.\nIn circumstances where a cyber attack rises to the level of a cyberwar, the States involved in the conflict would need to be identified. In accordance with Hague Convention III, the parties to conflict would need to notify neutral States. Until that time, a neutral State would not be bound by the obligations of Hague Convention V, unless they should have known about the conflict. Even if a cyber attack is deemed an \"armed attack,\" generally the identity of the attacker is unknown. In such\n Id. at xii.\n Id.\n Id. at xiii.

The movement of troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies by belligerents across the territory of a neutral state is forbidden. Belligerents are forbidden from erecting wireless telegraphy stations or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea on the territory of a neutral state. They are further prohibited from using any of such stations erected prior to the war on the territory of a neutral state for purely military purposes, unless it has been opened for the service of public messages. These prohibitions apply only to direct communications by belligerents to their forces. A neutral State has a responsibility to prohibit such activity from being conducted on its territory. Certainly, belligerents may not launch an attack from within the telecommunication infrastructure of a neutral State. There is an exception, however, to this principle of information warfare.\na. Telegraph Exception\nA neutral State is allowed to let belligerents use telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to the neutral State or its nationals. The neutral State does, however, have to ensure any restrictions or prohibitions are applied impartially to both belligerents. The same applies for private infrastructure systems. If this is the case, a belligerent may utilize the State's telecommunications infrastructure and equipment. The level of State activism by the neutral, though, may range; the greater the degree of activism, the more likely it is a neutral State will violate its duties under the law of neutrality. It is one thing for private companies of a neutral State to conduct commerce with a belligerent State, and another for the State itself to assist a belligerent. As long as a neutral State impartially makes its networks available to both sides, there is no reason\n Hague Convention V Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 18 October 1907, art. 2 [hereinafter Hague V].\n Id. art. 3(a).\n Id. art. 3(b).\n Brown, supra note 195, at 208.\n Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 5.\n Schmitt et al., supra note 231, at 15.\n Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 8.\n Id. art. 9.\n Brown, supra note 195, at 208 (explaining why there is no duty on neutral states to restrict belligerents from using its own communications systems or privately owned systems, so long as the neutral state and the privately owned systems are impartial).\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (stating the more active a State is in helping a belligerent, the more likely it is violating the law of neutrality); see infra Part VI.\n Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83; see generally L.

Law of the Seas “Peaceful Passage”\nHague Convention XIII governs the rights and duties of neutral States in naval war. The provisions are similar to those on land, but “the neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of war-ships or prizes belonging to belligerents.” Belligerent war-ships can remain in a port or territorial water of a neutral state for up to twenty-four hours.\nIn addition to Hague XIII, the Law of the Sea Convention provides more guidance to neutrals and belligerents in regards to the different navigational regimes. In international straits, it protects the right of transit passage, even through neutral straits. Belligerent forces transiting a neutral international strait must refrain from hostile activities not incident to their transit, but they may “take defensive measures consistent with their security, including the launching and recovery of military devices, screen formation steaming, and acoustic and electronic surveillance, and may respond in self-defense to a hostile act or hostile intent.” Once again, analogizing cyberspace to an international strait results in a potentially practical rule for international law.\nDue to the way the Internet is structured, it is foolhardy to prohibit a cyber weapon to peacefully pass through a neutral State’s cyberspace. In most situations, the neutral State will not even know that the electrons passed through its sovereignty. Nor is there much the State can do, short of severing all computer connections with other States.\n## B. Responsibility of a Neutral\nSome scholars argue that a neutral must keep electrons from a belligerent from transiting its cyberspace. These same scholars suggest that a neutral will lose its protected status if it fails to meet this impossible burden.\nUnder this rule, if a neutral state cannot or does not take action to halt a cyber attack, a belligerent may choose to counter by physically attacking the neutral state’s commu\n SCHMITT ET AL., *supra* note 231, at 15 (adding that if a neutral state does not act impartially, the “victim” belligerent may take necessary and proportionate steps to end the violation).\n TIKK ET AL., *supra* note 18, at 83.\n Hague Convention XIII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 18 October 1907.\n Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 10.\n Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 12.\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4 (caveating the idea that a neutral nation may suspend passage of belligerent warships through its territorial seas).\n COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n See Kelsey, *supra* note 28, at 1444–45 (considering the scope of the duty of neutrality; specifically, whether neutral states hold the practical methods of detecting a cyber attack).\n Kastenberg, *supra* note 26, at 56 (“A surrender of neutrality or acquiescence to belligerent activity may draw a neutral state into the conflict”).\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nnications infrastructure. Thus, even without the physical violation of a neutral state's territory, a cyber attack may force a neutral state to become unwillingly involved.\nWhy should we espouse such an impossible burden on neutrals? Nothing in the Hague Conventions suggests that a State must defend against anything less than a physical invasion of its territory. The Hague Conventions allow for warships to pass through territorial waters of a neutral and for the usage of telecommunication infrastructure. Jeffrey Kelsey in *Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare* argues that the meaning of neutrality should evolve to an “intent-based view of neutrality” so that neutrals are able to escape an impossible burden. “This view would not require the neutral state to take action to prevent the unintentional passage of the cyber weapons through its borders . . .” This is the right answer, but international law already allows for this.\nIt is an entirely different situation where a neutral State allows a belligerent to conduct attacks from its cyberspace. In these cases, the neutral needs to aggressively pursue those committing these attacks or face attack upon its own network. A neutral must also ensure that its servers are not being used for command and control of belligerent fighters. In such a case, “the server might be a valid military target because it’s being used for the communications or command and control of the enemy fighters in the areas of hostilities.” “Although every server has a physical location, the Internet is not segmented along national borders, and the enemy may gain greater tactical advantage from a server hosted half way around the world than from one located right in the middle of hostilities.\nNeutrals will have to remain vigilant that belligerents do not use the servers located in their sovereign territory for command and control, or face being subject to attack. International law, however, must acknowledge that cyberspace falls under the telegraph exception to the law of neutrality, allowing electrons to freely transit cyberspace. One must remember that the law of neutrality only applies in an actual international armed conflict in cyberspace. Just because there is an international armed conflict on the ground does not necessarily mean there is a conflict in cyberspace, triggering the law of neutrality. The next section applies these concepts to the cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008.\n## VI.

These countries have better cyber security and were able to prevent an information blockade of Georgia. Private U.S. technology companies, unbeknownst to the United States government, allowed Georgia to use their servers for news and governmental services, not military operations. The Estonian government allowed the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hang on a server in their country and the President of Poland hosted official press releases from the Georgian government on a section of their website.

Issues of Sovereignty\nBefore considering whether the law of neutrality was violated or whether it even applied, one must look at issues of sovereignty. Since both Tulip and Google hosted Georgian websites on their servers, one can assume that Georgian citizens at least accessed these websites, if not interacted with them. These sites were on servers located in the United States without the consent of the United States government. Therefore, Georgian citizens violated the sovereignty of the United States every time they accessed these websites. Unless of course, there is a right of \"transit passage,\" which would allow nationals of one State to freely transit the cyberspace of other States without the express permission of the sovereign.\n## B. Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks\nAssuming a right of \"transit passage\" exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks. The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic. \"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\" Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nIn fact, a self-appointed representatives of the Russian hacker underground claimed responsibility for a “Stop Georgia” website, which was set up to coordinate some of the cyber attacks on Georgian websites. When cyber attacks cannot be sufficiently linked to ongoing hostilities, the cyber attacks cannot take on the legal classification of the physical conflict. At this point, the cyber attacks must go through their own analysis.\nIn the end, the damage was minimal — email disruptions and website unavailability. The damages were further limited by the low interconnectivity of the country. “The main damage was in limiting the nation’s possibilities to distribute information about the ongoing military conflict, in ‘making its voice heard’ to the world and in communicating with the Georgian people.” The effects of the cyber attacks alone were not severe enough to amount to a “use of force” under Article 2(4) and certainly not enough to justify self-defense in response to an “armed attack” under Article 51 therefore, neither the law of armed conflict nor the law of neutrality applied.\n## C. Regardless, the Law of Neutrality Would Not Have Been Violated\nEven if LOAC did apply to the situation, the telegraph exception to Hague V would permit a neutral State to allow the use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.\nOf course, the level of state activism in permitting the use of telecommunications may range, from simply accepting data flow through private infrastructure to lending server space as was the case with Poland and Estonia, to actively supporting the functioning of telecommunications. Not all activities on this scale need necessarily be interpreted in a similar measure in the light of Article 8 of the Hague Convention cited above, but the smaller the degree of state activism, the less there is reason to speak of the state violating neutrality.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n Kaminski, supra note 7, at 82 (distinguishing “actual damage” from the immeasurable damage that resulted from the attacks).\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n Todd, supra note 16, at 91–92 (“There was no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack . . . The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy.”).\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nIn addition, the cyber attacks were not military operations since Russia denied all involvement and there was no actual evidence to the contrary. Therefore, the actions of the neutral States could not have interfered with military operations. Georgia also treated the cyber attacks as a computer security issue, rather than as cyberwarfare. The website that the neutral States assisted with were communication outlets and not military in nature.\nFinally, Hague V requires that if a neutral State allows the use of its telecommunications infrastructure by belligerents, it must do so impartially. Russia never requested any similar assistance; therefore, there is no evidence of impartiality. Consequently, even if the law of armed conflict applied to the cyber attack in Georgia, the assisting States did nothing in violation of the law of neutrality.\n## D. Cyber Cooperation\nThe assistance by Poland, Estonia, and the United States companies has been described as a “cyber alliance.” This alliance limited the damages that the cyber attacks caused on Georgia. The governments of Poland and Estonia supported Georgia with technical assistance and server space. In addition, two private companies in the United States gave Georgia server space. Since the cyber attacks were considered the work of hackers, it was a criminal problem. As such, these attacks were separate from the international armed conflict, which was conducted on the ground in Georgia. It is in the interest of all States to have a global response to such criminal attacks. States should not be afraid to assist in such non-state sponsored cyber attacks, because they fear violating the law of neutrality. Cyber security is going to take a global effort to be effective.\n## VII. CONCLUSION\nThe designers of the Internet were utopians, who created a decentralized network to withstand nuclear attack, intending it to be a domain free of government control. They believed that this new parallel world could escape the evils of government. The designers envisioned new communities\n\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nWith time, however, cyberspace succumbed to human nature and its malfeasance. Citizens are now looking to their sovereigns to police the bad acts occurring in cyberspace. As e-commerce has exploded in cyberspace, companies also want the protections offered by a sovereign such as stability and preservation of property rights. The free flow of information has threatened the existence of other sovereigns, who control their people through restricting and molding the information available to their citizenry.\nAs States exert control in cyberspace, borders are forming in cyberspace. These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nThe UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace, this is an infeasible burden.\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure. No other interpretation of the law of neutrality is feasible in cyberspace. A fear of violating the law of neutrality should not hinder State action in cyberspace.\n Any future change that would allow one to control the path the packets of a message travel would destroy packet switching, one of the founding principles of the Internet."

It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself. From a more technical point of view, this is scarcely true because in its modern meaning \"neutrality\" is a legal status involving certain rights and duties. It therefore contemplates the existence of some sort of international legal system.¹\n# I.

At the same time, however, cyberspace creates great new vulnerabilities, which have the potential to disrupt peace and stability in the world.⁴\nAlthough cyberspace has existed for the last several decades, there are still no international rules, much less standard definitions applicable to this new domain.⁵ Utilizing cyber operations or\n* CDR Danielle Higson is the Director of the Cyber, Information Operations, and Intelligence Law Division of the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.”¹⁴ “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”¹⁵ Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.”¹⁶ At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons.¹⁷ Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare.¹⁸ “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.”¹⁹ This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.²⁰\n¹⁴ John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated.²¹ The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful.²² In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations.²³ Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it.²⁴ Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.”²⁵ While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status.²⁶ A misguided view of the law of\n²¹ See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality. Part VI wraps up analyzing how States did not lose neutral status by assisting Georgia in 2008 during its cyber crisis. Before looking at how sovereignty and the law of neutrality apply in cyberspace, it is important to understand the structure and value of the Internet.\n## II. THE CENTERPIECE OF CYBERSPACE – THE INTERNET\n“The Net negates geometry. While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.”³⁴ It is not a definable or describable place. Yet, one can find things within the Internet that one did not know existed nor where they were located.³⁵ “The Net is ambient – nowhere in particular but everywhere at once.”³⁶ One can access the Internet by logging on from wherever one is physically located,³⁷ placing oneself virtually in cyberspace while simultaneously remaining in the territorial sovereign of where one began the journey. While virtually exploring cyberspace, one seamlessly transcends into and across the cyberspace of other States. These unique characteristics pose a challenge for sovereignty. Although the Internet is only a subset of cyberspace, this paper primarily concentrates on the Internet in exploring how to create a regime for sovereignty in cyberspace. This section examines the characteristics of the Internet that will impact the choice of a regime.\n## A. The Birth of the Internet\nIn the interest of National Security, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) provided the funding and institutional support for the research that led to the development of the Internet.³⁸ Despite DoD’s motives, the aspirations and vision of a unique group of electrical engineers and unorthodox computer programmers, who desired to redesign the way computers worked in order to amplify human thinking and communication, designed the Internet.³⁹ Desiring to keep the Inter-\n³⁴ WILLIAM J.

C. R. Licklider, a psychologist at MIT, headed the program.⁴³ The DoD created ARPA with a broad mandate to fund cutting-edge research and strategically placed the Agency directly below the Secretary of Defense.⁴⁴ “Throughout the 1960s groups at various universities and research centers were funded to work on different aspects of interactive computing and networking.”⁴⁵ First, the research focused on enabling users to interact with a computer through a terminal, which then turned to connecting computers in different geographic locations to enable them to collaborate and share materials.⁴⁶ In 1965, the researchers linked a computer in Massachusetts to one in California through a telephone network, but large blocks of data caused problems when they created traffic jams.⁴⁷ A packet-switching network, which “allows for faster travel speeds, a higher volume of information, and permits the system to withstand additional stresses,”⁴⁸ still utilized today, turned out to be the solution.⁴⁹\nIn the fall of 1969 at UCLA, the first computer network, ARPANET, was born.⁵⁰ It was deliberately designed with “a distributed, redundant structure so that it could survive partial nuclear destruction and the knockout of military headquarters.”⁵¹ By the end of that year, four host computers connected approximately one thousand researchers around the country.⁵² The network got bigger and bigger and was utilized more for sending messages than its original purpose of sharing expensive resources among the different research centers.⁵³ In 1975, the military became interested in the network and began using it for communication.⁵⁴ In 1982, the network was split into MILNET,\n⁴⁰ JACK GOLDSMITH &amp; TIM WU, WHO CONTROLS THE INTERNET?, ILLUSIONS OF BORDERLESS WORLD 23 (2006) (referring to the structure of the Internet’s design as open, minimalist, and neutral because it is willing to accept any time of computer or network to join, does not require much of the computers or networks to join, and treats all applications the same).\n⁴¹ Id.\n⁴² HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n⁴³ HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n⁴⁴ HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (commenting the design was to ensure the project would be independent of pressures from individual services for specific projects).\n⁴⁵ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (asserting that there was interest throughout the United States of people who were eager to reinvent computing).\n⁴⁶ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n⁴⁷ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n⁴⁸ See Sharon R.

The Backbone of the Internet\nThe Internet is a very large system of interconnected networks “with significant built-in capacity to resist concentrations of power and authoritarian control.”60 It is a packet-switching network, which distributes messages by breaking them up into smaller addressed packets that follow independent routes to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original message.61 Instead of a central control, independent routers ensure “the addressed packets flow around saturated channels.”62 Not only does this system provide improved efficiency, it provides a more secure system of communication.63 “If one node goes down, the network reroutes around it.”64 Depending on the demand at any given time, packets travel on the most efficient path, causing there to be no predictable paths of travel.65 There is also no way of prohibiting a packet from traveling on an open network of a particular State.66 One message, depending on size, can be divided up into multitude of packets, which all theoretically can travel on a different path through the cyberspace of different sovereign\n55 HANSON, supra note 38, at 59.\n56 George K Walker, Information Warfare and Neutrality, 33 VAND.

It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers . . . There is no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.⁷⁰\nA great deal of the functionality of the Internet is attributed to the end-to-end principle, which network architects, Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David Clark, used as their guiding principle in designing the Internet.⁷¹\nRather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network — to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network's core. The core is kept as simple as possible.⁷²\nSo any changes to the architecture of the Internet such as authentication or content filtering should not be done by changes to the network itself, but rather by applications attached to the network.⁷³\nThe backbone of the Internet being the packet-switching network and the common language of TCP/IP is essential to maintain the current interoperable Internet.⁷⁴ In the interest of cyber security, commercial and governmental organizations utilize firewalls to protect themselves from the evils lurking on the Internet.⁷⁵ These firewalls are applications that keep computers safe from some attacks and prevent some websites from being seen, but they do not stop the flow of electrons on the network, which crosses all State boundaries.\n⁶⁷ See WALKER, supra note 56, at 1095.\n⁶⁸ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61.\n⁶⁹ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61 (“The Internet became the network of networks using this protocol.”).\n⁷⁰ ACLU v.

World-wide Dependence on the Internet\nSince its humble beginnings in a research lab in 1969, “cyberspace has grown and spread to become a commons, a critical infrastructure that is pervasive and upon which societies worldwide have become dependent for commerce, recreation, communication, delivery of government services, research, education and a host of other activities.”76 A key qualification to being a major State power today is Internet connectivity.77 In order to survive as a State and remain economically competitive, States have to embrace the Internet and continue to build the infrastructure that it requires.78 The global networking of high speed information processing systems are “made possible by the ground based international telecommunications infrastructure and a growing constellation of satellites which provide countries with a means to acquire and transmit information.”79\nIn 2010, global Internet usage was over 2 billion people.80 Most States have public facilities, such as libraries and Internet cafés, where people can log onto the Internet for free.81 “U.S. and international businesses trade goods and services in cyberspace, moving assets across the globe in seconds. In addition to facilitating trade in other sectors, cyberspace is itself a key sector of the global economy.”82 Around the world, States’ critical infrastructures such as power distribution, telecommunications, banking, emergency services, transportation, national defense, and more are becoming ever dependent on the efficiencies offered by cyberspace.83 Stock exchanges and Air Traffic Control around the world are linked and dependent on the cyber infrastructure.84 Cyberspace has become the seas of commerce and the backbone of our global society, which demands a regime of sovereignty that will ensure the free flow of electrons currently enjoyed on the Internet.\n76 Julie J.C.H.

ESTABLISHING SOVEREIGNTY IN THE NEWEST FRONTIER\n“To Aristotle the idea of a placeless, borderless community would have seemed very strange; it appeared self-evident to him that a state — a self-governing political unit — had a definite, bounded territory in which the citizens lived and over which they exerted control.”85 Defining what constitutes sovereignty, however, is very difficult.86 Sovereignty is defined as “1. Supreme dominion, authority or rule. 2. The supreme political authority of an independent state. 3. The state itself.”87 The definition does not specify what sovereignty includes. In Article 2(4), the Charter of the United Nations speaks of protecting territorial integrity, “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”88 “Preserving state sovereignty is a vital goal of both state-based international organizations and individual countries.”89 Sovereignty, however, is treated differently in each physical domain, striking a balance between States’ interests and global needs.\n## A. The Essence of Sovereignty\n“Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is\n85 MITCHELL, supra note 34, at 151.\n86 Patrick W.

Although once thought to be merely an enhancement to the other existing domains, the concept of cyberspace as its own domain was recently accepted.¹⁰¹ Even though cyberspace is very different from the other naturally occurring domains, it does share some similarities.\n## B. Sovereignty in the Physical Domains\n“The global reach of the Internet, a network of networks, leads some to assume it is ungovernable since it reaches beyond national borders.”¹⁰² Similar concerns existed when mankind entered the domains of air and space.¹⁰³\nWhen states and individuals started developing the technological capability to enter the domains of sea, air, and outer space, strong arguments existed for each of these domains to remain free from sovereign control. However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.¹⁰⁴\n⁹⁶ See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65.\n⁹⁷ Patrick D.

Although ultimately codified in treatises, these international regimes resulted from State practices.¹⁰⁵ Since cyberspace will most likely follow the same trajectory, current State practices in cyberspace are critical to its future.\ni. Land\nOriginally, principles of sovereignty were about controlling territory and the people in it. “During the 17th century, the concept of sovereigns as individual monarchs gave way to the Westphalian state system of governments as sovereigns.”¹⁰⁶ Since the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the international system has been dominated by the State actor, which holds exclusive authority over the land and people within its geographic boundary.¹⁰⁷ “Under [this] traditional understanding of sovereignty, [States] occupy a territorially-defined physical locus, such that ‘sovereignty’ and ‘country’ are inextricably intertwined. [States] are defined by the territory they control, and [States] possess exclusive authority over events within their borders.”¹⁰⁸ Before long, States had to decide on a regime for the seas.\nii. Sea\nThe seas, which cover “two-thirds of the world’s surface,”¹⁰⁹ originally were not controlled or owned.¹¹⁰ Over time, this led way to the high seas being open to all with sovereign States only exerting control over the territorial seas bordering its country.¹¹¹ “The evolution of the law can be seen as a response to, and a reconciliation of, the conflicting interests of the Members of the international\n¹⁰⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 29 (noting that this reliance on state practices “means that a change in state interests or technological capabilities might change the legal status of these domains”).\n¹⁰⁶ J.

The three-mile limit has become thus the traditional breadth of the territorial sea.\"¹¹⁶ By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was a principle of international law that the high seas were free and open while States could exert sovereignty in their territorial waters.¹¹⁷\nSince early times, the law of the sea has had to balance conflicting economic, political, and strategic interests among States.¹¹⁸ \"With the geometric expansion of international trade following World War II . . . and the increasing awareness of interdependence among the nations of the free world, the importance of the freedom of the seas and navigation in their waters and airspace were reemphasized.\"¹¹⁹ This concept of sovereignty was first codified in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas, and culminated in 1982 with the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III),¹²⁰ which established national and international waters and airspace.¹²¹ National waters include a State's internal waters and its territorial seas.¹²² It set the territorial seas as twelve nautical miles from the States' shores.¹²³ The international waters include the contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and the high seas.¹²⁴ \"Ships and aircraft enjoy high seas freedoms,\" which include freedom of navigation and overflight of international waters.¹²⁵\nAlthough sovereignty is recognized in the territorial waters of a State, UNCLOS III provides for the \"innocent\" passage of ships, not aircraft, through these waters \"for the purpose of continuous and expeditious traversing of the territorial sea\" as long as \"it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.\"¹²⁶ The Convention prohibits the launch and recovery of aircraft and any exercise with weapons while a ship is conducting innocent passage, considering these\n112 BOWETT, supra note 109, at 1.\n113 Franzese, supra note 86, at 19; see also R.R.

Outer Space\nWith the dawn of rockets and satellites, the world had to decide how high up a State’s sovereignty goes.¹⁴² Some argued that it extended indefinitely, but this was not practical given the laws of planetary science and the lack of ability to exert control in space.¹⁴³ “Sovereignty can only truly exist if states can exert control, or sovereignty over the areas they claim.”¹⁴⁴ Prior to the launching of satellites and the beginning of actual space research in 1957, no sovereign conducted activity in outer space, thus precluding any effective control over outer space and the celestial bodies.¹⁴⁵ The United States and the Soviet Union were the first States to conduct actual research in outer space, but neither State made any territorial claim.¹⁴⁶ In 1958, the two States came to an early agreement to prohibit territorial sovereignty over outer space.¹⁴⁷ United States policy makers “faced the challenge to develop policy that protected Space for peaceful purposes for the good of all mankind, while at the same time that responded to the potential Armageddon-like conflict in the frigid, biting reality of the Cold War arms race.”¹⁴⁸\nThe Outer Space Treaty of 1967 codifies the legal status of outer space as free from sovereignty.¹⁴⁹ China, however, is challenging this principle and arguing that their sovereignty extends into outer space, because there is no definition of where territorial air space ends and outer space begins.¹⁵⁰ Even though the Treaty provides that exploration in space is supposed to be for peace-\n¹⁴⁰ The Convention on International Civil Aviation, Dec. 7, 1944, pt.

The domains are global in scope and indifferent to physical terrain or lines drawn on a map with near instantaneous effects transmitted through their domains. Both cyber and space are global commons vital to civil and commercial activities and essential to the economy and military operations.”¹⁵⁵\nOne major difference, however, is the ease of accessibility of cyberspace versus space. A Master’s thesis from 1965 once asked: “where is space? [W]ho controls it?”¹⁵⁶ These are the same questions that we ask today about cyberspace.\n## C. Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nCyberspace needs the rule of law inherent in sovereignty, but it needs to be open for international transit. “As with maritime trade, the path to future prosperity relies on open access, engagement and cooperation among friends and allies in the global cyberspace commons.”¹⁵⁷ Although similar to space, cyberspace cannot be a true global commons “governed collectively for the common benefit of all mankind,”¹⁵⁸ effectively prohibiting State sovereignty. The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms.¹⁵⁹ “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.”¹⁶⁰ A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance.\n¹⁵¹ Robert W.

Utopian Beginnings\nIn the 1990s, John Perry Barlow, lyrics writer for the Grateful Dead, advocated for a separate legal regime for cyberspace, totally outside of state control.¹⁶¹ Barlow and others believed that cyberspace was “a new frontier, where people lived in peace, under their own rules, liberated from the constraints of an oppressive society and free from government meddling.”¹⁶² After President Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act into law, Barlow wrote his famous *Declaration of Cyberspace Independence*, based on the Declaration of Independence, and distributed it widely.¹⁶³\n“Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone . . . You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one . . . Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions . . . We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”¹⁶⁴\n“The belief that cyberspace should be free from government interference, or sovereignty, led to the idea that cyberspace is, in fact, immune from state sovereignty.”¹⁶⁵ However, this ideal has become very unrealistic. Although cyberspace was once believed to be free from government control and regulation, States are being to exert their control over cyberspace in order to ensure liberty.¹⁶⁶ As a result, sovereignty needs to apply in cyberspace. “We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.”¹⁶⁷ States will have to want to exert sovereignty in cyberspace and in order to do this there will have to be borders in cyberspace. How States construct these borders is another matter.¹⁶⁸\n---\n¹⁶¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 17; see also Franzese, supra note 86, at 11–12.\n¹⁶² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 13.\n¹⁶³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 19–20 (explaining that the Communications Decency Act “punished all transmission of ‘indecent’ sexual communications or images on the Internet ‘in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age’”).\n¹⁶⁴ John Perry Barlow, *A Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace* (Feb. 8, 1996), http://www.homes.eff.org/-barlow/Declaration-Final.html.\n¹⁶⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 11.\n¹⁶⁶ LESSIG, supra note 65, at 3.\n¹⁶⁷ LESSIG, supra note 65, at 4.\n¹⁶⁸ See Forrest Hare, *Borders in Cyberspace: Can Sovereignty Adapt to the Challenges of Cyber Security*, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 88, 101–03 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/06_HARE_Borders%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n19\n## ii. The Taming of Cyberspace\nOver the last decade, States have begun exerting their sovereignty in cyberspace in response to complaints from its citizens and a need to control the information seen by those citizens. Western States have exerted control on content or access to content in order to protect their citizens from child pornography, sale of Nazi paraphernalia, and other ills.¹⁶⁹ States have also had to regulate content on the Internet in order to safeguard intellectual property. Repressive states such as China and Belarus have constructed barriers to access in an effort to keep western ideals of democracy from its citizens' purview on the Internet.¹⁷⁰\nAs far back as 1995, the Germans prosecuted the German manager of CompuServe Deutschland for \"failing to prevent child pornography, much of which came from outside Germany, from reaching German citizens.\"¹⁷¹ Regulating local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is a key to States controlling what content its citizens can view on the Internet. Once notified of the existence of illegal content, German, British, and French laws require their local ISPs to screen out the offending content.¹⁷² This protects the citizens of those States, but it does not stop the offending content from transiting the States' cyberspace.\nPrior to 2000, it was believed that a State could not control an Internet provider in another State.¹⁷³ In a landmark decision, the French courts held that Yahoo, a United States corporation, violated French law by allowing Nazi paraphernalia to appear for sale on web pages accessible in France.¹⁷⁴ Acknowledging that a one hundred percent blockage was impossible, the court \"ordered Yahoo to make a 'reasonable effort' to block French users.\"¹⁷⁵ France was not blocking the websites from its cyberspace, but it was erecting a border around its citizens whom it wanted to protect from the Nazi goods being sold.\nAlthough China allows access to the Internet, it has carefully engineered accessible content. China \"is trying to create an Internet that is free enough to support and maintain the world's fastest growing economy, and yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on power.\"¹⁷⁶ In order to accomplish this goal, China has created a \"firewall\" popularly known as the \"Great Firewall of China\" around its people that filters and removes any unapproved information headed to a Chinese national.¹⁷⁷ In 2002, Yahoo signed the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, which requires that \"Yahoo filter materials that might be harmful or threat-\n---\n¹⁶⁹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 154–57.\n¹⁷⁰ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 87–104; ACCESS CONTROLLED: THE SHAPING OF POWER, RIGHTS, AND RULE IN CYBERSPACE 161–69, 449–73 (Ronald Deibert et al. eds., 2010); LESSIG, supra note 65, at 79–80, 308; see generally Fyodor Pavlyuchenko, Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 156, 156–62 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., Kenneth Geers trans. 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/11_PAVLYUCHENKO_Belorussia.pdf (censorship).\n¹⁷¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n¹⁷² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n¹⁷³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 1–10.\n¹⁷⁴ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 7–8.\n¹⁷⁵ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 8.\n¹⁷⁶ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 89.\n¹⁷⁷ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 92–93 (outlining the process by which the \"Great Firewall of China\" filters unapproved internet information); ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nening to Party rule.”¹⁷⁸ These processes, however, do not prevent the data from actually entering China. Thus, determined savvy Internet users are able to circumvent most, if not all, of these barriers with relative ease.¹⁷⁹\nE-commerce requires a stable environment controlled by a sovereign who can protect companies and consumers from fraud. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, desired to make a company self-regulated by its users, but “quickly learned that to prevent fraud, enforce its contracts, and ensure stability in its auction services, it would depend critically on government coercion and the rule of law provided by a stable country like the United States.”¹⁸⁰ Originally run by community enforcement, eBay now has a full-time security staff of over eight hundred people.¹⁸¹\nStates are creating boundaries in cyberspace to protect its citizens, rather than its territory. Cyber crimes are being prosecuted by States regardless of the fact that the person was not physically within the State’s territory when accessing the Internet. The United States prosecutes a man who views child pornography on the Internet while physically being in another country by using extra-territorial jurisdiction.¹⁸² “Developing sovereignty, [however,] ultimately requires an international regime with specific rules and procedures regulating state activity in that domain, including a requirement to identify and track transnational actors.”¹⁸³\niii. A Navigational Regime for Cyberspace – Transit Passage\nAs with the domains of sea, air, and space, there is a need for international space in cyberspace. “And like the seas, the U.S. will feel the need to maintain ‘freedom of navigation’ in cyberspace as a primary beneficiary of its existence.”¹⁸⁴ The networks of cyberspace need to be kept “open for the economic, social, and security interests of this country and its citizens.”¹⁸⁵ Cyberspace has provided an information-based revolution in the public, private, and military sectors.¹⁸⁶\nThis domain, however, is very different from the other physical domains. A State may not even be aware of someone in their cyberspace. Cyber operations occur “at computing speeds delivered at the speed of light.”¹⁸⁷ In order to physically enter a State, a traveler must present a passport; yet a cyber traveler can enter any State in cyberspace without any documents. This freedom is not something that we want to stop with the recognition of sovereignty in cyberspace. Therefore, international law needs to adopt a regime for cyberspace that allows for the free flow of electrons through all of cyberspace.\n¹⁷⁸ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 9.\n¹⁷⁹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 103; ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\n¹⁸⁰ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129.\n¹⁸¹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129–135.\n¹⁸² LESSIG, supra note 65, at 299.\n¹⁸³ Franzese, supra note 86, at 34 (emphasizing that because cyberspace is man-made, it is necessarily influenced by politics and shaped by social actions and institutions); see also Geoffrey L. Herrera, Cyberspace and Sovereignty: Thoughts on Physical Space and Digital Space (Mar. 22, 2006), http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p98069_index.html.\n¹⁸⁴ Matus, supra note 5, at 33 (noting that this issues will require “significant strategic changes to U.S. national security”).\n¹⁸⁵ Huntley, supra note 18, at 2 (asserting that, in order to keep these cyberspace networks open, the United States must also conduct operations in cyberspace).\n¹⁸⁶ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 56.\n¹⁸⁷ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 52.\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n21\nAn international strait is a fitting analogy for Cyberspace, which has an extremely high volume of traffic that is exponentially growing.¹⁸⁸ “For cyberspace capabilities, like e-mail, the utility of the tool to each user increases exponentially as the number of people using the tool increases.”¹⁸⁹ Therefore, it is in society’s interest to keep this traffic in cyberspace free flowing, like the desire to keep the high volume of traffic transiting an international strait. There are no clear borders in cyberspace. Once a packet of information is launched into cyberspace, it is nearly impossible to tell when it passes from one sovereign to another until it finally arrives. “Although every computer, server, and wire is located in some place subject to other regulatory frameworks, the paths by which packets travel across the Internet are largely beyond the control of the user and may pass through many different sovereign jurisdictions in route from senders to recipient.”¹⁹⁰ In an international strait, the territorial seas of more than one State overlap. The public and freely accessible parts of cyberspace are like international straits connecting the sovereign territories where the hardware is located.\n“[T]ransit passage allows all ships and aircraft freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the international strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.”¹⁹¹ Cyberspace absolutely requires this type of framework in order not to disrupt the flow of ideas and commerce in cyberspace. “Transit passage” would allow the electrons to transit cyberspace in their normal mode of operation. No State could suspend transit passage of its cyberspace; but if it so chose, it could disconnect from the network. In addition, transit passage would apply to military operations and would allow for the transit passage through a neutral territory. The hardware, however, is actually in sovereign territory. The relationship between the physical hardware and cyberspace is similar to that of territorial waters and the high seas.\n“Every component of every information and telecommunications network around the world, under the sea, and in the air is subject to proprietary interests – whether that of a private company, a sovereign government, or possibly both. Each copper wire, fiber-optic cable, microwave relay tower, satellite transponder, or Internet router has been produced or installed by some entity whose legal successors not only maintain ownership of that physical asset but also expect protection of the same by sovereign authorities.”¹⁹²\nRecognizing a right of “transit passage” in cyberspace would merely make current State practice customary international law. Every day, States violate the sovereignty of other States as emails from one office transit across national boundaries in route to the office next door. Because of the way the Internet operates, one message can be broken up into multiple packets that travel the public Internet in the most expeditious manner regardless of path. Cyberspace knows no boundaries; packets do not request permission when transiting from one State to another.\n¹⁸⁸ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 51.\n¹⁸⁹ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 58; see also Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, and Benjamin Tilly, Metcalf’s Law is Wrong, IEEE SPECTRUM (July 2006), http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-iswrong.\n¹⁹⁰ Ryan et al., supra note 76, at 89.\n¹⁹¹ Barney, supra note 159, at 75.\n¹⁹² Kanuck, supra note 20, at 1573.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nPrivate password protected networks in cyberspace should be treated as internal waters, where complete territorial sovereignty is imposed. Information from unauthorized users on these networks would violate territorial sovereignty. The Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) would be one example of such network. This type of regime would balance society's need for freedom of navigation of cyberspace while protecting national security.\nSovereignty in cyberspace is required and States will need to exert this sovereignty. It is imperative that States police crime, protect property interest, and take action against known attacks originating within its cyberspace.^^ Global society is heavily reliant on the Internet's continuing functionality, which requires packets to continue surfing freely through cyberspace. In addition, States cannot currently exert territorial control over the electrons passing through its cyberspace; therefore, there is no way to enforce exclusive sovereignty in cyberspace. Consequently, States should operate in cyberspace, assuming a right of \"transit passage,\" and, with time, the practice will become a part of customary international law.\n## IV. APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT TO CYBERSPACE\nThe governance of cyberspace will require the utilization of all types of law, such as criminal law, tort law, and property law. Since cyberspace interconnects global society, it most assuredly will require international law. As long as cyberwar is possible, the international body of law known as the law of armed conflict^^ will apply to cyberspace.\n## A. Applying the Law of Armed Conflict to Cyberspace\nOver the last decade, great scholars have debated whether the law of armed conflict (LOAC) should apply to cyberspace, and the majority consensus agrees that it should.^^ The pivotal question,\n^^ See generally Matthew J.

Additional Protocol I requires a State to review any “new weapon, means or method of warfare to ensure its employment would not violate international law.”²⁰⁰\nWhat activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force is the subject of much debate. “At a point along the spectrum of interstate activities called the line of belligerency, a use of force by a state establishes an international armed conflict as a matter of law and the law of armed conflict applies.”²⁰¹ Jus ad bellum is this body of international law, found in both customary and treaty law, governing a State’s resort to force against another state.²⁰² The UN Charter is the primary modern source of jus ad bellum.²⁰³ In accordance with the UN Charter, “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”²⁰⁴ In order to know what activities between states are forbidden in cyberspace, we must know what activities constitute the threat or use of force in cyberspace. In Article 51, the UN Charter offers that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”²⁰⁵ Humanity must determine what an armed attack is in cyberspace in order to know when a state has a right to protect itself. “Although a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense [under Article 51] in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.”²⁰⁶\napplicabilityofihltocna.pdf (applying international humanitarian law); Dunlap, supra note 21, at 81–95 (arguing basic tenets of LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT are sufficient to address cyberwar); Todd, supra note 3, at 66–102 (arguing for a definition-based approach); David E.

Defining the Use of Force/Armed Attack in Cyberspace\nWithout defining any of the terms individually, the UN Charter uses the terms “use of force,” “armed attack,” and “aggression” in its various provisions, spurring over fifty years of debate about the terms’ meanings.²⁰⁷ Although economic and political coercion can threaten international stability, generally the use of force is understood to mean armed force.²⁰⁸ “Until the advent of information operations, most coercion could be handily categorized into one of several boxes, for few options existed that could not be typed as political, economic, or armed in nature.”²⁰⁹ Cyber attacks, however, do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Cyber attacks are launched for a multitude of reasons with a wide spectrum of effects. Therefore, it had to be determined “whether a cyber attack, because it does not involve the use of kinetic force, is a prohibited use of force under the Charter and customary international law.”²¹⁰ Michael N. Schmitt analyzed this and answered it in the affirmative, stating “the key is to move from an instrument-based paradigm (economics, politics, kinetic military force) to one based on the consequences caused by the action.”²¹¹ To help analyze the consequences of an operation, Schmitt developed seven criteria to determine whether the effects are “more like those caused by economic and political coercion or by physical coercion.”²¹²\nIn defining the use of force in cyberspace, most scholars look to the seven-factor analysis proposed by Michael N. Schmitt to determine a use of force.²¹³ These factors include: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and State responsibility²¹⁴ and give a qualitative analysis of how military operations differ from nonmilitary operations, such as diplomatic and economic coercion.²¹⁵ The use of force does not include non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare.²¹⁶\nThe next major law of armed conflict issue is evaluating when a cyber attack amounts to an “armed attack” under Article 51, allowing a State to respond with force in self-defense.²¹⁷ The previous analysis is not applicable in this determination, because “use of force” and “armed attack” is not the same.²¹⁸ Typically, cyber attacks with violent effects are the legally equivalent to armed attacks.²¹⁹ Therefore, cyber attacks utilizing cyber weapons (e.g., viruses, worms, logic bombs) and resulting in human suffering or property damage (beyond the computer program or data attacked) can be\n207 Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 199, at 150; SHARP, SR., supra note 2, at 73.\n208 Schmitt, supra note 195, at 908.\n209 Schmitt, supra note 195, at 908.\n210 Michael N.

In those instances, however, where there is an international armed conflict and the law of armed conflict does apply, States need to know their obligations under the law of neutrality.\n## V. NEUTRALITY\nThe designers created the Internet, as implied by its name, to be a single network to link data across States and oceans.²²⁵ In reality, the Internet is a multitude of different linked networks.²²⁶ Therefore, there is no way to predict the State or States through which a packet will travel during transmission.²²⁷ A belligerent cannot know which route its cyber attack will take on its way to its target, which makes it impossible to ensure that it does not cross a neutral’s cyberspace territory.²²⁸\nIn a cyberwar, how a State remains neutral has been the subject of much discourse. The primary question is whether an electron from a belligerent State crossing through a neutral State’s cyberspace territory is a violation of the law of neutrality.²²⁹ Another question is whether a neutral State is required to take action against a belligerent electron transiting its cyberspace. “More than a century after the Hague Conventions’ enactment, their general conception of neutrality remains controlling law, but international law does not explicitly address cyberattacks and cyber neutrality.”²³⁰ This paper argues that an electron passing through a neutral’s State’s cyberspace does not violate the neutral’s sovereignty and should not require action by the neutral State.²³¹ Since it appears that there is not go-\n220 Dörmann, supra note 195, at 4.\n221 See Dunlap, supra note 21, at 86 (recognizing the importance of neutrally assessing the consequences of a cyber incident to see if it rises to the equivalent level of an armed attack); see also Rowe, supra note 195, at 1.\n222 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 99.\n223 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 99.\n224 Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 199, at 172; Huntley, supra note 18, at 2–3 (implying that certain principles of international law do little to control states in cyber space).\n225 Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432.\n226 Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432 (“Keeping with its military roots, the Internet has a significant level of redundancy in the backbone, such that if one network experiences a problem the Internet can reroute traffic in real time to avoid it.”).\n227 See Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432.\n228 See Lessig, supra note 65, at 63.\n229 John S.

SCHMITT, et al., INTERNATIONAL\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\ning to be any new international agreements written for cyberspace in the near future, it is imperative to interpret the existing rules in the most appropriate fashion. “Because international law imposes a dramatically different legal status on states that enter conflicts between other states as a belligerent, compared with states electing to remain neutral, the choice between belligerency and neutrality represents one of the most significant responsibilities for a sovereign’s national security decision-making body.”²³²\n## A. The Law of Neutrality\nThe law of neutrality embodied in the Hague Conventions is basically as old as time, in the sense it is based on basic economic principles. Neutrals want to stay out of war and yet want to protect their commerce and trade routes. Belligerents need resources, which neutrals have. Since the law of neutrality has endured with little change through all of the technological revolutions of the last several centuries, there is no reason to believe the same law will not apply in cyberspace, where commerce along with communication is paramount.\n## i. History of Neutrality\nAs early as the fourteenth century and possibly even earlier, “neutrality” was applied in its modern sense.²³³ Since at least the fifteenth century, a prime objective of belligerents was the destruction of the enemy’s trade, which appears to have led to the law of neutral rights at sea.²³⁴\nThe problem has always been the reconciliation of the incompatible interests of neutrals and belligerents, or, rather, a compromise between these irreconcilable interests. The neutral has sought to maintain his freedom of trade; the belligerent has sought to cut off all supplies from his enemy. The desire to seize goods of the enemy may be\nHUMANITARIAN LAW RESEARCH INITIATIVE, COMPUTERS AND WAR: THE LEGAL BATTLESPACE 15 (2004), (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University), http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf (asserting the mere routing of data through a neutral State is allowed), with LAWRENCE T.

Therefore, there must be an international armed conflict in order for the law of neutrality to apply.²⁴⁰ Hague Convention III Relative To the Opening of Hostilities governs the beginning of hostilities. With regards to neutral states, Hague Convention III states:\nThe existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware of the existence of a state of war.²⁴¹\nThese provisions will limit the application of neutrality law to cyberwarfare. Thus far, no States have taken responsibility for any cyber attacks.\nIn circumstances where a cyber attack rises to the level of a cyberwar,²⁴² the States involved in the conflict would need to be identified. In accordance with Hague Convention III, the parties to conflict would need to notify neutral States. Until that time, a neutral State would not be bound by the obligations of Hague Convention V, unless they should have known about the conflict. Even if a cyber attack is deemed an \"armed attack,\" generally the identity of the attacker is unknown. In such\n²³⁵ Id. at xii.\n²³⁶ Id.\n²³⁷ Id. at xiii.

The movement of troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies by belligerents across the territory of a neutral state is forbidden.²⁴³ Belligerents are forbidden from erecting wireless telegraphy stations or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea on the territory of a neutral state.²⁴⁴ They are further prohibited from using any of such stations erected prior to the war on the territory of a neutral state for purely military purposes, unless it has been opened for the service of public messages.²⁴⁵ These prohibitions apply only to direct communications by belligerents to their forces.²⁴⁶ A neutral State has a responsibility to prohibit such activity from being conducted on its territory.²⁴⁷ Certainly, belligerents may not launch an attack from within the telecommunication infrastructure of a neutral State.²⁴⁸ There is an exception, however, to this principle of information warfare.\na. Telegraph Exception\nA neutral State is allowed to let belligerents use telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to the neutral State or its nationals.²⁴⁹ The neutral State does, however, have to ensure any restrictions or prohibitions are applied impartially to both belligerents.²⁵⁰ The same applies for private infrastructure systems.²⁵¹ If this is the case, a belligerent may utilize the State's telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.²⁵² The level of State activism by the neutral, though, may range; the greater the degree of activism, the more likely it is a neutral State will violate its duties under the law of neutrality.²⁵³ It is one thing for private companies of a neutral State to conduct commerce with a belligerent State, and another for the State itself to assist a belligerent.²⁵⁴ As long as a neutral State impartially makes its networks available to both sides, there is no reason\n²⁴³ Hague Convention V Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 18 October 1907, art. 2 [hereinafter Hague V].\n²⁴⁴ Id. art. 3(a).\n²⁴⁵ Id. art. 3(b).\n²⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 195, at 208.\n²⁴⁷ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 5.\n²⁴⁸ Schmitt et al., supra note 231, at 15.\n²⁴⁹ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 8.\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 9.\n²⁵¹ Brown, supra note 195, at 208 (explaining why there is no duty on neutral states to restrict belligerents from using its own communications systems or privately owned systems, so long as the neutral state and the privately owned systems are impartial).\n²⁵² Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n²⁵³ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (stating the more active a State is in helping a belligerent, the more likely it is violating the law of neutrality); see infra Part VI.\n²⁵⁴ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83; see generally L.

Law of the Seas “Peaceful Passage”\nHague Convention XIII governs the rights and duties of neutral States in naval war.²⁵⁷ The provisions are similar to those on land, but “the neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of war-ships or prizes belonging to belligerents.”²⁵⁸ Belligerent war-ships can remain in a port or territorial water of a neutral state for up to twenty-four hours.²⁵⁹\nIn addition to Hague XIII, the Law of the Sea Convention provides more guidance to neutrals and belligerents in regards to the different navigational regimes.²⁶⁰ In international straits, it protects the right of transit passage, even through neutral straits.²⁶¹ Belligerent forces transiting a neutral international strait must refrain from hostile activities not incident to their transit, but they may “take defensive measures consistent with their security, including the launching and recovery of military devices, screen formation steaming, and acoustic and electronic surveillance, and may respond in self-defense to a hostile act or hostile intent.”²⁶² Once again, analogizing cyberspace to an international strait results in a potentially practical rule for international law.\nDue to the way the Internet is structured, it is foolhardy to prohibit a cyber weapon to peacefully pass through a neutral State’s cyberspace. In most situations, the neutral State will not even know that the electrons passed through its sovereignty.²⁶³ Nor is there much the State can do, short of severing all computer connections with other States.\n## B. Responsibility of a Neutral\nSome scholars argue that a neutral must keep electrons from a belligerent from transiting its cyberspace.²⁶⁴ These same scholars suggest that a neutral will lose its protected status if it fails to meet this impossible burden.\nUnder this rule, if a neutral state cannot or does not take action to halt a cyber attack, a belligerent may choose to counter by physically attacking the neutral state’s commu\n²⁵⁵ SCHMITT ET AL., *supra* note 231, at 15 (adding that if a neutral state does not act impartially, the “victim” belligerent may take necessary and proportionate steps to end the violation).\n²⁵⁶ TIKK ET AL., *supra* note 18, at 83.\n²⁵⁷ Hague Convention XIII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 18 October 1907.\n²⁵⁸ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 10.\n²⁵⁹ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 12.\n²⁶⁰ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n²⁶¹ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4 (caveating the idea that a neutral nation may suspend passage of belligerent warships through its territorial seas).\n²⁶² COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n²⁶³ See Kelsey, *supra* note 28, at 1444–45 (considering the scope of the duty of neutrality; specifically, whether neutral states hold the practical methods of detecting a cyber attack).\n²⁶⁴ Kastenberg, *supra* note 26, at 56 (“A surrender of neutrality or acquiescence to belligerent activity may draw a neutral state into the conflict”).\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nnications infrastructure. Thus, even without the physical violation of a neutral state's territory, a cyber attack may force a neutral state to become unwillingly involved.²⁶⁵\nWhy should we espouse such an impossible burden on neutrals? Nothing in the Hague Conventions suggests that a State must defend against anything less than a physical invasion of its territory. The Hague Conventions allow for warships to pass through territorial waters of a neutral and for the usage of telecommunication infrastructure. Jeffrey Kelsey in *Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare* argues that the meaning of neutrality should evolve to an “intent-based view of neutrality” so that neutrals are able to escape an impossible burden.²⁶⁶ “This view would not require the neutral state to take action to prevent the unintentional passage of the cyber weapons through its borders . . .”²⁶⁷ This is the right answer, but international law already allows for this.\nIt is an entirely different situation where a neutral State allows a belligerent to conduct attacks from its cyberspace.²⁶⁸ In these cases, the neutral needs to aggressively pursue those committing these attacks or face attack upon its own network. A neutral must also ensure that its servers are not being used for command and control of belligerent fighters. In such a case, “the server might be a valid military target because it’s being used for the communications or command and control of the enemy fighters in the areas of hostilities.”²⁶⁹ “Although every server has a physical location, the Internet is not segmented along national borders, and the enemy may gain greater tactical advantage from a server hosted half way around the world than from one located right in the middle of hostilities.²⁷⁰\nNeutrals will have to remain vigilant that belligerents do not use the servers located in their sovereign territory for command and control, or face being subject to attack. International law, however, must acknowledge that cyberspace falls under the telegraph exception to the law of neutrality, allowing electrons to freely transit cyberspace. One must remember that the law of neutrality only applies in an actual international armed conflict in cyberspace. Just because there is an international armed conflict on the ground does not necessarily mean there is a conflict in cyberspace, triggering the law of neutrality. The next section applies these concepts to the cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008.\n## VI.

Issues of Sovereignty\nBefore considering whether the law of neutrality was violated or whether it even applied, one must look at issues of sovereignty. Since both Tulip and Google hosted Georgian websites on their servers, one can assume that Georgian citizens at least accessed these websites, if not interacted with them. These sites were on servers located in the United States without the consent of the United States government. Therefore, Georgian citizens violated the sovereignty of the United States every time they accessed these websites.²⁹¹ Unless of course, there is a right of \"transit passage,\" which would allow nationals of one State to freely transit the cyberspace of other States without the express permission of the sovereign.\n## B. Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks\nAssuming a right of \"transit passage\" exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality²⁹² because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks.²⁹³ The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic.²⁹⁴ \"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\"²⁹⁵ Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.²⁹⁶\n288 Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 26, at 60 (asking whether the Georgian case impacted America's status as a cyber neutral and, more broadly, whether the United States can remain neutral during a cyber conflict).\n289 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (\"the fact that a neutral state permits use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment does not automatically entail breach of neutrality for that state.\").\n290 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n291 This may seem improbable since Georgia is an ally of the United States and it is hard to believe the United States would object to an ally transiting its cyberspace. Compare this, however, to the physical world where that would translate to Canadians crossing the United States border without a passport. See Fredland, supra note 286 and accompanying text.\n292 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n293 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 80.\n294 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n295 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n296 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 74–75.\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n33\nThere is no doubt regarding the involvement of the Russian hacker community in the cyber attacks: the coordination of and support to the attacks took place mainly in the Russian language and was conducted on Russian or Russia-friendly forums. However, there is no evident link to the Russian administration, and the Russian government has denied any involvement in the cyber assaults. The Project Grey Goose team was unable to find, in their research into the Russian hacker sites, any references to state organizations guiding or directing attacks.²⁹⁷\nIn fact, a self-appointed representatives of the Russian hacker underground claimed responsibility for a “Stop Georgia” website, which was set up to coordinate some of the cyber attacks on Georgian websites.²⁹⁸ When cyber attacks cannot be sufficiently linked to ongoing hostilities, the cyber attacks cannot take on the legal classification of the physical conflict. At this point, the cyber attacks must go through their own analysis.\nIn the end, the damage was minimal — email disruptions and website unavailability.²⁹⁹ The damages were further limited by the low interconnectivity of the country.³⁰⁰ “The main damage was in limiting the nation’s possibilities to distribute information about the ongoing military conflict, in ‘making its voice heard’ to the world and in communicating with the Georgian people.”³⁰¹ The effects of the cyber attacks alone were not severe enough to amount to a “use of force” under Article 2(4) and certainly not enough to justify self-defense in response to an “armed attack” under Article 51³⁰² therefore, neither the law of armed conflict nor the law of neutrality applied.\n## C. Regardless, the Law of Neutrality Would Not Have Been Violated\nEven if LOAC did apply to the situation, the telegraph exception to Hague V would permit a neutral State to allow the use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.³⁰³\nOf course, the level of state activism in permitting the use of telecommunications may range, from simply accepting data flow through private infrastructure to lending server space as was the case with Poland and Estonia, to actively supporting the functioning of telecommunications. Not all activities on this scale need necessarily be interpreted in a similar measure in the light of Article 8 of the Hague Convention cited above, but the smaller the degree of state activism, the less there is reason to speak of the state violating neutrality.³⁰⁴\n²⁹⁷ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁸ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁹ Kaminski, supra note 7, at 82 (distinguishing “actual damage” from the immeasurable damage that resulted from the attacks).\n³⁰⁰ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰¹ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰² Todd, supra note 16, at 91–92 (“There was no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack . . . The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy.”).\n³⁰³ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n³⁰⁴ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nIn addition, the cyber attacks were not military operations since Russia denied all involvement and there was no actual evidence to the contrary.³⁰⁵ Therefore, the actions of the neutral States could not have interfered with military operations.³⁰⁶ Georgia also treated the cyber attacks as a computer security issue, rather than as cyberwarfare.³⁰⁷ The website that the neutral States assisted with were communication outlets and not military in nature.³⁰⁸\nFinally, Hague V requires that if a neutral State allows the use of its telecommunications infrastructure by belligerents, it must do so impartially.³⁰⁹ Russia never requested any similar assistance; therefore, there is no evidence of impartiality.³¹⁰ Consequently, even if the law of armed conflict applied to the cyber attack in Georgia, the assisting States did nothing in violation of the law of neutrality.³¹¹\n## D. Cyber Cooperation\nThe assistance by Poland, Estonia, and the United States companies has been described as a “cyber alliance.”³¹² This alliance limited the damages that the cyber attacks caused on Georgia.³¹³ The governments of Poland and Estonia supported Georgia with technical assistance and server space.³¹⁴ In addition, two private companies in the United States gave Georgia server space.³¹⁵ Since the cyber attacks were considered the work of hackers, it was a criminal problem.³¹⁶ As such, these attacks were separate from the international armed conflict, which was conducted on the ground in Georgia. It is in the interest of all States to have a global response to such criminal attacks. States should not be afraid to assist in such non-state sponsored cyber attacks, because they fear violating the law of neutrality. Cyber security is going to take a global effort to be effective.\n## VII. CONCLUSION\nThe designers of the Internet were utopians, who created a decentralized network to withstand nuclear attack, intending it to be a domain free of government control. They believed that this new parallel world could escape the evils of government. The designers envisioned new communities\n305 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n306 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n307 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n308 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n309 Hague V, supra note 243, art. 8–9 (seeing the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telecommunications infrastructure).\n310 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n311 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n312 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266 (using this terms to explain how these nations helped Georgia mitigate the consequences of the cyber attacks, through the help of resources).\n313 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266.\n314 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266.\n315 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 77.\n316 See generally McGavran, supra note 199, at 262 (explaining that criminal syndicates rent hijacked computers to the highest bidder for a low price, around four cents).\nVol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n35\nin cyberspace would develop better ways of regulating conduct than traditional government. In the beginning, it appeared that this new domain was borderless and beyond the control of States.\nWith time, however, cyberspace succumbed to human nature and its malfeasance. Citizens are now looking to their sovereigns to police the bad acts occurring in cyberspace. As e-commerce has exploded in cyberspace, companies also want the protections offered by a sovereign such as stability and preservation of property rights. The free flow of information has threatened the existence of other sovereigns, who control their people through restricting and molding the information available to their citizenry.\nAs States exert control in cyberspace, borders are forming in cyberspace. These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nThe UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace,³¹⁷ this is an infeasible burden.\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure. No other interpretation of the law of neutrality is feasible in cyberspace. A fear of violating the law of neutrality should not hinder State action in cyberspace.\n³¹⁷ Any future change that would allow one to control the path the packets of a message travel would destroy packet switching, one of the founding principles of the Internet."

It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself. From a more technical point of view, this is scarcely true because in its modern meaning\"neutrality\"is a legal status involving certain rights and duties. It therefore contemplates the existence of some sort of international legal system.¹ # I.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.”¹⁴ “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”¹⁵ Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.”¹⁶ At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons.¹⁷ Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare.¹⁸ “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.”¹⁹ This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.²⁰ ¹⁴ John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

If the State responds with force against the other State, there will be an international armed conflict as referred to in Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions and a state of war as referred to in the Hague Conventions. See U.N. Charter art. 2. In this paper, international armed conflict and war are used synonymously.

However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated.²¹ The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful.²² In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations.²³ Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it.²⁴ Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.”²⁵ While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status.²⁶ A misguided view of the law of ²¹ See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality. Part VI wraps up analyzing how States did not lose neutral status by assisting Georgia in 2008 during its cyber crisis. Before looking at how sovereignty and the law of neutrality apply in cyberspace, it is important to understand the structure and value of the Internet.\n## II. THE CENTERPIECE OF CYBERSPACE – THE INTERNET “The Net negates geometry. While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.”³⁴ It is not a definable or describable place. Yet, one can find things within the Internet that one did not know existed nor where they were located.³⁵ “The Net is ambient – nowhere in particular but everywhere at once.”³⁶ One can access the Internet by logging on from wherever one is physically located,³⁷ placing oneself virtually in cyberspace while simultaneously remaining in the territorial sovereign of where one began the journey. While virtually exploring cyberspace, one seamlessly transcends into and across the cyberspace of other States. These unique characteristics pose a challenge for sovereignty. Although the Internet is only a subset of cyberspace, this paper primarily concentrates on the Internet in exploring how to create a regime for sovereignty in cyberspace. This section examines the characteristics of the Internet that will impact the choice of a regime.\n## A. The Birth of the Internet In the interest of National Security, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) provided the funding and institutional support for the research that led to the development of the Internet.³⁸ Despite DoD’s motives, the aspirations and vision of a unique group of electrical engineers and unorthodox computer programmers, who desired to redesign the way computers worked in order to amplify human thinking and communication, designed the Internet.³⁹ Desiring to keep the Inter- ³⁴ WILLIAM J.

C. R. Licklider, a psychologist at MIT, headed the program.⁴³ The DoD created ARPA with a broad mandate to fund cutting-edge research and strategically placed the Agency directly below the Secretary of Defense.⁴⁴ “Throughout the 1960s groups at various universities and research centers were funded to work on different aspects of interactive computing and networking.”⁴⁵ First, the research focused on enabling users to interact with a computer through a terminal, which then turned to connecting computers in different geographic locations to enable them to collaborate and share materials.⁴⁶ In 1965, the researchers linked a computer in Massachusetts to one in California through a telephone network, but large blocks of data caused problems when they created traffic jams.⁴⁷ A packet-switching network, which “allows for faster travel speeds, a higher volume of information, and permits the system to withstand additional stresses,”⁴⁸ still utilized today, turned out to be the solution.⁴⁹ In the fall of 1969 at UCLA, the first computer network, ARPANET, was born.⁵⁰ It was deliberately designed with “a distributed, redundant structure so that it could survive partial nuclear destruction and the knockout of military headquarters.”⁵¹ By the end of that year, four host computers connected approximately one thousand researchers around the country.⁵² The network got bigger and bigger and was utilized more for sending messages than its original purpose of sharing expensive resources among the different research centers.⁵³ In 1975, the military became interested in the network and began using it for communication.⁵⁴ In 1982, the network was split into MILNET, ⁴⁰ JACK GOLDSMITH &amp; TIM WU, WHO CONTROLS THE INTERNET?, ILLUSIONS OF BORDERLESS WORLD 23 (2006) (referring to the structure of the Internet’s design as open, minimalist, and neutral because it is willing to accept any time of computer or network to join, does not require much of the computers or networks to join, and treats all applications the same).\n⁴¹ Id.\n⁴² HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n⁴³ HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n⁴⁴ HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (commenting the design was to ensure the project would be independent of pressures from individual services for specific projects).\n⁴⁵ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (asserting that there was interest throughout the United States of people who were eager to reinvent computing).\n⁴⁶ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n⁴⁷ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n⁴⁸ See Sharon R.

The Backbone of the Internet The Internet is a very large system of interconnected networks “with significant built-in capacity to resist concentrations of power and authoritarian control.”60 It is a packet-switching network, which distributes messages by breaking them up into smaller addressed packets that follow independent routes to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original message.61 Instead of a central control, independent routers ensure “the addressed packets flow around saturated channels.”62 Not only does this system provide improved efficiency, it provides a more secure system of communication.63 “If one node goes down, the network reroutes around it.”64 Depending on the demand at any given time, packets travel on the most efficient path, causing there to be no predictable paths of travel.65 There is also no way of prohibiting a packet from traveling on an open network of a particular State.66 One message, depending on size, can be divided up into multitude of packets, which all theoretically can travel on a different path through the cyberspace of different sovereign\n\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nDifferent computers and networks are able to communicate with each other because they were all designed to use the same universal language, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).⁶⁸ ARPA required the use of this common language, which spread because of its open design and its freely available software and documentation.⁶⁹ No single entity — academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit — administers the Internet. It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers... There is no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.⁷⁰ A great deal of the functionality of the Internet is attributed to the end-to-end principle, which network architects, Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David Clark, used as their guiding principle in designing the Internet.⁷¹ Rather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network — to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network's core. The core is kept as simple as possible.⁷² So any changes to the architecture of the Internet such as authentication or content filtering should not be done by changes to the network itself, but rather by applications attached to the network.⁷³ The backbone of the Internet being the packet-switching network and the common language of TCP/IP is essential to maintain the current interoperable Internet.⁷⁴ In the interest of cyber security, commercial and governmental organizations utilize firewalls to protect themselves from the evils lurking on the Internet.⁷⁵ These firewalls are applications that keep computers safe from some attacks and prevent some websites from being seen, but they do not stop the flow of electrons on the network, which crosses all State boundaries.\n⁶⁷ See WALKER, supra note 56, at 1095.\n⁶⁸ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61.\n⁶⁹ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61 (“The Internet became the network of networks using this protocol.”).\n⁷⁰ ACLU v.

World-wide Dependence on the Internet Since its humble beginnings in a research lab in 1969, “cyberspace has grown and spread to become a commons, a critical infrastructure that is pervasive and upon which societies worldwide have become dependent for commerce, recreation, communication, delivery of government services, research, education and a host of other activities.”76 A key qualification to being a major State power today is Internet connectivity.77 In order to survive as a State and remain economically competitive, States have to embrace the Internet and continue to build the infrastructure that it requires.78 The global networking of high speed information processing systems are “made possible by the ground based international telecommunications infrastructure and a growing constellation of satellites which provide countries with a means to acquire and transmit information.”79 In 2010, global Internet usage was over 2 billion people.80 Most States have public facilities, such as libraries and Internet cafés, where people can log onto the Internet for free.81 “U.S. and international businesses trade goods and services in cyberspace, moving assets across the globe in seconds. In addition to facilitating trade in other sectors, cyberspace is itself a key sector of the global economy.”82 Around the world, States’ critical infrastructures such as power distribution, telecommunications, banking, emergency services, transportation, national defense, and more are becoming ever dependent on the efficiencies offered by cyberspace.83 Stock exchanges and Air Traffic Control around the world are linked and dependent on the cyber infrastructure.84 Cyberspace has become the seas of commerce and the backbone of our global society, which demands a regime of sovereignty that will ensure the free flow of electrons currently enjoyed on the Internet.\n\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\n“To Aristotle the idea of a placeless, borderless community would have seemed very strange; it appeared self-evident to him that a state — a self-governing political unit — had a definite, bounded territory in which the citizens lived and over which they exerted control.”85 Defining what constitutes sovereignty, however, is very difficult.86 Sovereignty is defined as “1. Supreme dominion, authority or rule. 2. The supreme political authority of an independent state. 3. The state itself.”87 The definition does not specify what sovereignty includes. In Article 2(4), the Charter of the United Nations speaks of protecting territorial integrity, “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”88 “Preserving state sovereignty is a vital goal of both state-based international organizations and individual countries.”89 Sovereignty, however, is treated differently in each physical domain, striking a balance between States’ interests and global needs.\n## A. The Essence of Sovereignty “Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 his natural liberty and absolute right to anything that tempts him and that he can take; what he gains by the social contract is civil liberty and the legal right of property in what he possesses.”⁹⁶ A domain is an area where control is exerted.⁹⁷ “Since classical times, two domains of operation dominated military and civilian operations: land and sea.”⁹⁸ With the development of powered flight in 1904, the domain of air became a new possibility.⁹⁹ Finally in 1955, the birth of the “space age” opened the last physical domain, space, but it was not until the 1980s that “the US DoD acknowledged outer space as a fourth war fighting domain.”¹⁰⁰ Even after the international community recognized each of these domains, it took time for States to create specifically tailored treaties for each domain to address sovereignty.\nNow the world community needs to address the development of cyberspace and how sovereignty should relate to this new domain, which is like no other for it is man-made and does not physically exist. Although once thought to be merely an enhancement to the other existing domains, the concept of cyberspace as its own domain was recently accepted.¹⁰¹ Even though cyberspace is very different from the other naturally occurring domains, it does share some similarities.\n## B. Sovereignty in the Physical Domains “The global reach of the Internet, a network of networks, leads some to assume it is ungovernable since it reaches beyond national borders.”¹⁰² Similar concerns existed when mankind entered the domains of air and space.¹⁰³ When states and individuals started developing the technological capability to enter the domains of sea, air, and outer space, strong arguments existed for each of these domains to remain free from sovereign control. However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.¹⁰⁴ ⁹⁶ See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65.\n⁹⁷ Patrick D.

Land Originally, principles of sovereignty were about controlling territory and the people in it. “During the 17th century, the concept of sovereigns as individual monarchs gave way to the Westphalian state system of governments as sovereigns.”¹⁰⁶ Since the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the international system has been dominated by the State actor, which holds exclusive authority over the land and people within its geographic boundary.¹⁰⁷ “Under [this] traditional understanding of sovereignty, [States] occupy a territorially-defined physical locus, such that ‘sovereignty’ and ‘country’ are inextricably intertwined. [States] are defined by the territory they control, and [States] possess exclusive authority over events within their borders.”¹⁰⁸ Before long, States had to decide on a regime for the seas.\nii. Sea The seas, which cover “two-thirds of the world’s surface,”¹⁰⁹ originally were not controlled or owned.¹¹⁰ Over time, this led way to the high seas being open to all with sovereign States only exerting control over the territorial seas bordering its country.¹¹¹ “The evolution of the law can be seen as a response to, and a reconciliation of, the conflicting interests of the Members of the international ¹⁰⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 29 (noting that this reliance on state practices “means that a change in state interests or technological capabilities might change the legal status of these domains”).\n¹⁰⁶ J.

The three-mile limit has become thus the traditional breadth of the territorial sea.\"¹¹⁶ By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was a principle of international law that the high seas were free and open while States could exert sovereignty in their territorial waters.¹¹⁷ Since early times, the law of the sea has had to balance conflicting economic, political, and strategic interests among States.¹¹⁸\"With the geometric expansion of international trade following World War II... and the increasing awareness of interdependence among the nations of the free world, the importance of the freedom of the seas and navigation in their waters and airspace were reemphasized.\"¹¹⁹ This concept of sovereignty was first codified in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas, and culminated in 1982 with the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III),¹²⁰ which established national and international waters and airspace.¹²¹ National waters include a State's internal waters and its territorial seas.¹²² It set the territorial seas as twelve nautical miles from the States' shores.¹²³ The international waters include the contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and the high seas.¹²⁴\"Ships and aircraft enjoy high seas freedoms,\"which include freedom of navigation and overflight of international waters.¹²⁵ Although sovereignty is recognized in the territorial waters of a State, UNCLOS III provides for the\"innocent\"passage of ships, not aircraft, through these waters\"for the purpose of continuous and expeditious traversing of the territorial sea\"as long as\"it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.\"¹²⁶ The Convention prohibits the launch and recovery of aircraft and any exercise with weapons while a ship is conducting innocent passage, considering these\n\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nIn straits used for international navigation, UNCLOS III provides for the right of “transit passage,” “freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.”¹³⁰ During “transit passage,” ships and submarines can transit in their normal mode of operation.¹³¹ Bordering States are not allowed to suspend transit passage.¹³² The Convention carefully balances a State’s need for security with the world’s needs for the freedom of navigation of the seas for commerce and trade. It is a balance like this that the new domain of cyberspace requires.\niii. Air Like cyberspace, the air was initially thought to be common to all.¹³³ With the rise of property rights, the belief that the owner of the land also owned the air above it became the law.¹³⁴ The concept of air sovereignty came with the age of flight,¹³⁵ and international law regarding air sovereignty started with state practice.¹³⁶ “The actions of various states throughout World War I, especially neutral countries’ refusal to allow overflight, firmly established air sovereignty as customary international law by the end of the war.”¹³⁷ The first codification was in 1919 in the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation in France, commonly known as the Paris Convention.¹³⁸ It established exclusive sovereignty in the air, but it made an exception for the right of innocent passage across the airspace.¹³⁹ The final codification was in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Chicago Convention, which states: “the contracting States recognize that every ¹²⁷ UNCLOS III, supra note 120, at pt.

Outer Space With the dawn of rockets and satellites, the world had to decide how high up a State’s sovereignty goes.¹⁴² Some argued that it extended indefinitely, but this was not practical given the laws of planetary science and the lack of ability to exert control in space.¹⁴³ “Sovereignty can only truly exist if states can exert control, or sovereignty over the areas they claim.”¹⁴⁴ Prior to the launching of satellites and the beginning of actual space research in 1957, no sovereign conducted activity in outer space, thus precluding any effective control over outer space and the celestial bodies.¹⁴⁵ The United States and the Soviet Union were the first States to conduct actual research in outer space, but neither State made any territorial claim.¹⁴⁶ In 1958, the two States came to an early agreement to prohibit territorial sovereignty over outer space.¹⁴⁷ United States policy makers “faced the challenge to develop policy that protected Space for peaceful purposes for the good of all mankind, while at the same time that responded to the potential Armageddon-like conflict in the frigid, biting reality of the Cold War arms race.”¹⁴⁸ The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 codifies the legal status of outer space as free from sovereignty.¹⁴⁹ China, however, is challenging this principle and arguing that their sovereignty extends into outer space, because there is no definition of where territorial air space ends and outer space begins.¹⁵⁰ Even though the Treaty provides that exploration in space is supposed to be for peace- ¹⁴⁰ The Convention on International Civil Aviation, Dec. 7, 1944, pt.

The domains are global in scope and indifferent to physical terrain or lines drawn on a map with near instantaneous effects transmitted through their domains. Both cyber and space are global commons vital to civil and commercial activities and essential to the economy and military operations.”¹⁵⁵ One major difference, however, is the ease of accessibility of cyberspace versus space. A Master’s thesis from 1965 once asked: “where is space? [W]ho controls it?”¹⁵⁶ These are the same questions that we ask today about cyberspace.\n## C. Sovereignty in Cyberspace Cyberspace needs the rule of law inherent in sovereignty, but it needs to be open for international transit. “As with maritime trade, the path to future prosperity relies on open access, engagement and cooperation among friends and allies in the global cyberspace commons.”¹⁵⁷ Although similar to space, cyberspace cannot be a true global commons “governed collectively for the common benefit of all mankind,”¹⁵⁸ effectively prohibiting State sovereignty. The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms.¹⁵⁹ “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.”¹⁶⁰ A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance.\n¹⁵¹ Robert W.

Utopian Beginnings In the 1990s, John Perry Barlow, lyrics writer for the Grateful Dead, advocated for a separate legal regime for cyberspace, totally outside of state control.¹⁶¹ Barlow and others believed that cyberspace was “a new frontier, where people lived in peace, under their own rules, liberated from the constraints of an oppressive society and free from government meddling.”¹⁶² After President Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act into law, Barlow wrote his famous *Declaration of Cyberspace Independence*, based on the Declaration of Independence, and distributed it widely.¹⁶³ “Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone... You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one... Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions... We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”¹⁶⁴ “The belief that cyberspace should be free from government interference, or sovereignty, led to the idea that cyberspace is, in fact, immune from state sovereignty.”¹⁶⁵ However, this ideal has become very unrealistic. Although cyberspace was once believed to be free from government control and regulation, States are being to exert their control over cyberspace in order to ensure liberty.¹⁶⁶ As a result, sovereignty needs to apply in cyberspace. “We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.”¹⁶⁷ States will have to want to exert sovereignty in cyberspace and in order to do this there will have to be borders in cyberspace. How States construct these borders is another matter.¹⁶⁸ --- ¹⁶¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 17; see also Franzese, supra note 86, at 11–12.\n¹⁶² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 13.\n¹⁶³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 19–20 (explaining that the Communications Decency Act “punished all transmission of ‘indecent’ sexual communications or images on the Internet ‘in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age’”).\n¹⁶⁴ John Perry Barlow, *A Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace* (Feb. 8, 1996), http://www.homes.eff.org/-barlow/Declaration-Final.html.\n¹⁶⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 11.\n¹⁶⁶ LESSIG, supra note 65, at 3.\n¹⁶⁷ LESSIG, supra note 65, at 4.\n¹⁶⁸ See Forrest Hare, *Borders in Cyberspace: Can Sovereignty Adapt to the Challenges of Cyber Security*, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 88, 101–03 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/06_HARE_Borders%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE Over the last decade, States have begun exerting their sovereignty in cyberspace in response to complaints from its citizens and a need to control the information seen by those citizens. Western States have exerted control on content or access to content in order to protect their citizens from child pornography, sale of Nazi paraphernalia, and other ills.¹⁶⁹ States have also had to regulate content on the Internet in order to safeguard intellectual property. Repressive states such as China and Belarus have constructed barriers to access in an effort to keep western ideals of democracy from its citizens' purview on the Internet.¹⁷⁰ As far back as 1995, the Germans prosecuted the German manager of CompuServe Deutschland for\"failing to prevent child pornography, much of which came from outside Germany, from reaching German citizens.\"¹⁷¹ Regulating local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is a key to States controlling what content its citizens can view on the Internet. Once notified of the existence of illegal content, German, British, and French laws require their local ISPs to screen out the offending content.¹⁷² This protects the citizens of those States, but it does not stop the offending content from transiting the States' cyberspace.\nPrior to 2000, it was believed that a State could not control an Internet provider in another State.¹⁷³ In a landmark decision, the French courts held that Yahoo, a United States corporation, violated French law by allowing Nazi paraphernalia to appear for sale on web pages accessible in France.¹⁷⁴ Acknowledging that a one hundred percent blockage was impossible, the court\"ordered Yahoo to make a 'reasonable effort' to block French users.\"¹⁷⁵ France was not blocking the websites from its cyberspace, but it was erecting a border around its citizens whom it wanted to protect from the Nazi goods being sold.\nAlthough China allows access to the Internet, it has carefully engineered accessible content. China\"is trying to create an Internet that is free enough to support and maintain the world's fastest growing economy, and yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on power.\"¹⁷⁶ In order to accomplish this goal, China has created a\"firewall\"popularly known as the\"Great Firewall of China\"around its people that filters and removes any unapproved information headed to a Chinese national.¹⁷⁷ In 2002, Yahoo signed the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, which requires that\"Yahoo filter materials that might be harmful or threat- --- ¹⁶⁹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 154–57.\n¹⁷⁰ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 87–104; ACCESS CONTROLLED: THE SHAPING OF POWER, RIGHTS, AND RULE IN CYBERSPACE 161–69, 449–73 (Ronald Deibert et al. eds., 2010); LESSIG, supra note 65, at 79–80, 308; see generally Fyodor Pavlyuchenko, Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 156, 156–62 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., Kenneth Geers trans. 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/11_PAVLYUCHENKO_Belorussia.pdf (censorship).\n¹⁷¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n¹⁷² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n¹⁷³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 1–10.\n¹⁷⁴ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 7–8.\n¹⁷⁵ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 8.\n¹⁷⁶ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 89.\n¹⁷⁷ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 92–93 (outlining the process by which the\"Great Firewall of China\"filters unapproved internet information); ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 ening to Party rule.”¹⁷⁸ These processes, however, do not prevent the data from actually entering China. Thus, determined savvy Internet users are able to circumvent most, if not all, of these barriers with relative ease.¹⁷⁹ E-commerce requires a stable environment controlled by a sovereign who can protect companies and consumers from fraud. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, desired to make a company self-regulated by its users, but “quickly learned that to prevent fraud, enforce its contracts, and ensure stability in its auction services, it would depend critically on government coercion and the rule of law provided by a stable country like the United States.”¹⁸⁰ Originally run by community enforcement, eBay now has a full-time security staff of over eight hundred people.¹⁸¹ States are creating boundaries in cyberspace to protect its citizens, rather than its territory. Cyber crimes are being prosecuted by States regardless of the fact that the person was not physically within the State’s territory when accessing the Internet. The United States prosecutes a man who views child pornography on the Internet while physically being in another country by using extra-territorial jurisdiction.¹⁸² “Developing sovereignty, [however,] ultimately requires an international regime with specific rules and procedures regulating state activity in that domain, including a requirement to identify and track transnational actors.”¹⁸³ iii. A Navigational Regime for Cyberspace – Transit Passage As with the domains of sea, air, and space, there is a need for international space in cyberspace. “And like the seas, the U.S. will feel the need to maintain ‘freedom of navigation’ in cyberspace as a primary beneficiary of its existence.”¹⁸⁴ The networks of cyberspace need to be kept “open for the economic, social, and security interests of this country and its citizens.”¹⁸⁵ Cyberspace has provided an information-based revolution in the public, private, and military sectors.¹⁸⁶ This domain, however, is very different from the other physical domains. A State may not even be aware of someone in their cyberspace. Cyber operations occur “at computing speeds delivered at the speed of light.”¹⁸⁷ In order to physically enter a State, a traveler must present a passport; yet a cyber traveler can enter any State in cyberspace without any documents. This freedom is not something that we want to stop with the recognition of sovereignty in cyberspace. Therefore, international law needs to adopt a regime for cyberspace that allows for the free flow of electrons through all of cyberspace.\n¹⁷⁸ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 9.\n¹⁷⁹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 103; ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\n¹⁸⁰ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129.\n¹⁸¹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129–135.\n¹⁸² LESSIG, supra note 65, at 299.\n¹⁸³ Franzese, supra note 86, at 34 (emphasizing that because cyberspace is man-made, it is necessarily influenced by politics and shaped by social actions and institutions); see also Geoffrey L. Herrera, Cyberspace and Sovereignty: Thoughts on Physical Space and Digital Space (Mar. 22, 2006), http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p98069_index.html.\n¹⁸⁴ Matus, supra note 5, at 33 (noting that this issues will require “significant strategic changes to U.S. national security”).\n¹⁸⁵ Huntley, supra note 18, at 2 (asserting that, in order to keep these cyberspace networks open, the United States must also conduct operations in cyberspace).\n¹⁸⁶ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 56.\n¹⁸⁷ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 52.\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE “[T]ransit passage allows all ships and aircraft freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the international strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.”¹⁹¹ Cyberspace absolutely requires this type of framework in order not to disrupt the flow of ideas and commerce in cyberspace. “Transit passage” would allow the electrons to transit cyberspace in their normal mode of operation. No State could suspend transit passage of its cyberspace; but if it so chose, it could disconnect from the network. In addition, transit passage would apply to military operations and would allow for the transit passage through a neutral territory. The hardware, however, is actually in sovereign territory. The relationship between the physical hardware and cyberspace is similar to that of territorial waters and the high seas.\n“Every component of every information and telecommunications network around the world, under the sea, and in the air is subject to proprietary interests – whether that of a private company, a sovereign government, or possibly both. Each copper wire, fiber-optic cable, microwave relay tower, satellite transponder, or Internet router has been produced or installed by some entity whose legal successors not only maintain ownership of that physical asset but also expect protection of the same by sovereign authorities.”¹⁹² Recognizing a right of “transit passage” in cyberspace would merely make current State practice customary international law. Every day, States violate the sovereignty of other States as emails from one office transit across national boundaries in route to the office next door. Because of the way the Internet operates, one message can be broken up into multiple packets that travel the public Internet in the most expeditious manner regardless of path. Cyberspace knows no boundaries; packets do not request permission when transiting from one State to another.\n¹⁸⁸ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 51.\n¹⁸⁹ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 58; see also Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, and Benjamin Tilly, Metcalf’s Law is Wrong, IEEE SPECTRUM, http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-iswrong.\n¹⁹⁰ Ryan et al., supra note 76, at 89.\n¹⁹¹ Barney, supra note 159, at 75.\n¹⁹² Kanuck, supra note 20, at 1573.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 Private password protected networks in cyberspace should be treated as internal waters, where complete territorial sovereignty is imposed. Information from unauthorized users on these networks would violate territorial sovereignty. The Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) would be one example of such network. This type of regime would balance society's need for freedom of navigation of cyberspace while protecting national security.\nSovereignty in cyberspace is required and States will need to exert this sovereignty. It is imperative that States police crime, protect property interest, and take action against known attacks originating within its cyberspace.^[193]^ Global society is heavily reliant on the Internet's continuing functionality, which requires packets to continue surfing freely through cyberspace. In addition, States cannot currently exert territorial control over the electrons passing through its cyberspace; therefore, there is no way to enforce exclusive sovereignty in cyberspace. Consequently, States should operate in cyberspace, assuming a right of\"transit passage,\"and, with time, the practice will become a part of customary international law.\n## IV. APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT TO CYBERSPACE The governance of cyberspace will require the utilization of all types of law, such as criminal law, tort law, and property law. Since cyberspace interconnects global society, it most assuredly will require international law. As long as cyberwar is possible, the international body of law known as the law of armed conflict^[194]^ will apply to cyberspace.\n## A. Applying the Law of Armed Conflict to Cyberspace Over the last decade, great scholars have debated whether the law of armed conflict (LOAC) should apply to cyberspace, and the majority consensus agrees that it should.^[195]^ The pivotal question, ^[193]^ See generally Matthew J.

Additional Protocol I requires a State to review any “new weapon, means or method of warfare to ensure its employment would not violate international law.”²⁰⁰ What activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force is the subject of much debate. “At a point along the spectrum of interstate activities called the line of belligerency, a use of force by a state establishes an international armed conflict as a matter of law and the law of armed conflict applies.”²⁰¹ Jus ad bellum is this body of international law, found in both customary and treaty law, governing a State’s resort to force against another state.²⁰² The UN Charter is the primary modern source of jus ad bellum.²⁰³ In accordance with the UN Charter, “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”²⁰⁴ In order to know what activities between states are forbidden in cyberspace, we must know what activities constitute the threat or use of force in cyberspace. In Article 51, the UN Charter offers that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”²⁰⁵ Humanity must determine what an armed attack is in cyberspace in order to know when a state has a right to protect itself. “Although a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense [under Article 51] in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.”²⁰⁶ applicabilityofihltocna.pdf (applying international humanitarian law); Dunlap, supra note 21, at 81–95 (arguing basic tenets of LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT are sufficient to address cyberwar); Todd, supra note 3, at 66–102 (arguing for a definition-based approach); David E.

Defining the Use of Force/Armed Attack in Cyberspace Without defining any of the terms individually, the UN Charter uses the terms “use of force,” “armed attack,” and “aggression” in its various provisions, spurring over fifty years of debate about the terms’ meanings.²⁰⁷ Although economic and political coercion can threaten international stability, generally the use of force is understood to mean armed force.²⁰⁸ “Until the advent of information operations, most coercion could be handily categorized into one of several boxes, for few options existed that could not be typed as political, economic, or armed in nature.”²⁰⁹ Cyber attacks, however, do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Cyber attacks are launched for a multitude of reasons with a wide spectrum of effects. Therefore, it had to be determined “whether a cyber attack, because it does not involve the use of kinetic force, is a prohibited use of force under the Charter and customary international law.”²¹⁰ Michael N. Schmitt analyzed this and answered it in the affirmative, stating “the key is to move from an instrument-based paradigm (economics, politics, kinetic military force) to one based on the consequences caused by the action.”²¹¹ To help analyze the consequences of an operation, Schmitt developed seven criteria to determine whether the effects are “more like those caused by economic and political coercion or by physical coercion.”²¹² In defining the use of force in cyberspace, most scholars look to the seven-factor analysis proposed by Michael N. Schmitt to determine a use of force.²¹³ These factors include: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and State responsibility²¹⁴ and give a qualitative analysis of how military operations differ from nonmilitary operations, such as diplomatic and economic coercion.²¹⁵ The use of force does not include non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare.²¹⁶ The next major law of armed conflict issue is evaluating when a cyber attack amounts to an “armed attack” under Article 51, allowing a State to respond with force in self-defense.²¹⁷ The previous analysis is not applicable in this determination, because “use of force” and “armed attack” is not the same.²¹⁸ Typically, cyber attacks with violent effects are the legally equivalent to armed attacks.²¹⁹ Therefore, cyber attacks utilizing cyber weapons (e.g., viruses, worms, logic bombs) and resulting in human suffering or property damage (beyond the computer program or data attacked) can be\n\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\n## V. NEUTRALITY\nThe designers created the Internet, as implied by its name, to be a single network to link data across States and oceans.²²⁵ In reality, the Internet is a multitude of different linked networks.²²⁶ Therefore, there is no way to predict the State or States through which a packet will travel during transmission.²²⁷ A belligerent cannot know which route its cyber attack will take on its way to its target, which makes it impossible to ensure that it does not cross a neutral’s cyberspace territory.²²⁸\nIn a cyberwar, how a State remains neutral has been the subject of much discourse. The primary question is whether an electron from a belligerent State crossing through a neutral State’s cyberspace territory is a violation of the law of neutrality.²²⁹ Another question is whether a neutral State is required to take action against a belligerent electron transiting its cyberspace. “More than a century after the Hague Conventions’ enactment, their general conception of neutrality remains controlling law, but international law does not explicitly address cyberattacks and cyber neutrality.”²³⁰ This paper argues that an electron passing through a neutral’s State’s cyberspace does not violate the neutral’s sovereignty and should not require action by the neutral State.²³¹ Since it appears that there is not go-\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 ing to be any new international agreements written for cyberspace in the near future, it is imperative to interpret the existing rules in the most appropriate fashion. “Because international law imposes a dramatically different legal status on states that enter conflicts between other states as a belligerent, compared with states electing to remain neutral, the choice between belligerency and neutrality represents one of the most significant responsibilities for a sovereign’s national security decision-making body.”²³² ## A. The Law of Neutrality The law of neutrality embodied in the Hague Conventions is basically as old as time, in the sense it is based on basic economic principles. Neutrals want to stay out of war and yet want to protect their commerce and trade routes. Belligerents need resources, which neutrals have. Since the law of neutrality has endured with little change through all of the technological revolutions of the last several centuries, there is no reason to believe the same law will not apply in cyberspace, where commerce along with communication is paramount.\n## i. History of Neutrality As early as the fourteenth century and possibly even earlier, “neutrality” was applied in its modern sense.²³³ Since at least the fifteenth century, a prime objective of belligerents was the destruction of the enemy’s trade, which appears to have led to the law of neutral rights at sea.²³⁴ The problem has always been the reconciliation of the incompatible interests of neutrals and belligerents, or, rather, a compromise between these irreconcilable interests. The neutral has sought to maintain his freedom of trade; the belligerent has sought to cut off all supplies from his enemy. The desire to seize goods of the enemy may be HUMANITARIAN LAW RESEARCH INITIATIVE, COMPUTERS AND WAR: THE LEGAL BATTLESPACE 15 (2004), (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University), http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf (asserting the mere routing of data through a neutral State is allowed), with LAWRENCE T.

Therefore, there must be an international armed conflict in order for the law of neutrality to apply.²⁴⁰ Hague Convention III Relative To the Opening of Hostilities governs the beginning of hostilities. With regards to neutral states, Hague Convention III states: The existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware of the existence of a state of war.²⁴¹ These provisions will limit the application of neutrality law to cyberwarfare. Thus far, no States have taken responsibility for any cyber attacks.\nIn circumstances where a cyber attack rises to the level of a cyberwar,²⁴² the States involved in the conflict would need to be identified. In accordance with Hague Convention III, the parties to conflict would need to notify neutral States. Until that time, a neutral State would not be bound by the obligations of Hague Convention V, unless they should have known about the conflict. Even if a cyber attack is deemed an\"armed attack,\"generally the identity of the attacker is unknown. In such ²³⁵ Id. at xii.\n²³⁶ Id.\n²³⁷ Id. at xiii.

The movement of troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies by belligerents across the territory of a neutral state is forbidden.²⁴³ Belligerents are forbidden from erecting wireless telegraphy stations or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea on the territory of a neutral state.²⁴⁴ They are further prohibited from using any of such stations erected prior to the war on the territory of a neutral state for purely military purposes, unless it has been opened for the service of public messages.²⁴⁵ These prohibitions apply only to direct communications by belligerents to their forces.²⁴⁶ A neutral State has a responsibility to prohibit such activity from being conducted on its territory.²⁴⁷ Certainly, belligerents may not launch an attack from within the telecommunication infrastructure of a neutral State.²⁴⁸ There is an exception, however, to this principle of information warfare.\na. Telegraph Exception A neutral State is allowed to let belligerents use telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to the neutral State or its nationals.²⁴⁹ The neutral State does, however, have to ensure any restrictions or prohibitions are applied impartially to both belligerents.²⁵⁰ The same applies for private infrastructure systems.²⁵¹ If this is the case, a belligerent may utilize the State's telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.²⁵² The level of State activism by the neutral, though, may range; the greater the degree of activism, the more likely it is a neutral State will violate its duties under the law of neutrality.²⁵³ It is one thing for private companies of a neutral State to conduct commerce with a belligerent State, and another for the State itself to assist a belligerent.²⁵⁴ As long as a neutral State impartially makes its networks available to both sides, there is no reason ²⁴³ Hague Convention V Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 18 October 1907, art. 2 [hereinafter Hague V].\n²⁴⁴ Id. art. 3(a).\n²⁴⁵ Id. art. 3(b).\n²⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 195, at 208.\n²⁴⁷ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 5.\n²⁴⁸ Schmitt et al., supra note 231, at 15.\n²⁴⁹ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 8.\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 9.\n²⁵¹ Brown, supra note 195, at 208 (explaining why there is no duty on neutral states to restrict belligerents from using its own communications systems or privately owned systems, so long as the neutral state and the privately owned systems are impartial).\n²⁵² Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n²⁵³ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (stating the more active a State is in helping a belligerent, the more likely it is violating the law of neutrality); see infra Part VI.\n²⁵⁴ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83; see generally L.

Law of the Seas “Peaceful Passage”\nHague Convention XIII governs the rights and duties of neutral States in naval war.²⁵⁷ The provisions are similar to those on land, but “the neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of war-ships or prizes belonging to belligerents.”²⁵⁸ Belligerent war-ships can remain in a port or territorial water of a neutral state for up to twenty-four hours.²⁵⁹\nIn addition to Hague XIII, the Law of the Sea Convention provides more guidance to neutrals and belligerents in regards to the different navigational regimes.²⁶⁰ In international straits, it protects the right of transit passage, even through neutral straits.²⁶¹ Belligerent forces transiting a neutral international strait must refrain from hostile activities not incident to their transit, but they may “take defensive measures consistent with their security, including the launching and recovery of military devices, screen formation steaming, and acoustic and electronic surveillance, and may respond in self-defense to a hostile act or hostile intent.”²⁶² Once again, analogizing cyberspace to an international strait results in a potentially practical rule for international law.\nDue to the way the Internet is structured, it is foolhardy to prohibit a cyber weapon to peacefully pass through a neutral State’s cyberspace. In most situations, the neutral State will not even know that the electrons passed through its sovereignty.²⁶³ Nor is there much the State can do, short of severing all computer connections with other States.\n## B. Responsibility of a Neutral\nSome scholars argue that a neutral must keep electrons from a belligerent from transiting its cyberspace.²⁶⁴ These same scholars suggest that a neutral will lose its protected status if it fails to meet this impossible burden.\nUnder this rule, if a neutral state cannot or does not take action to halt a cyber attack, a belligerent may choose to counter by physically attacking the neutral state’s commu\n²⁵⁵ SCHMITT ET AL., *supra* note 231, at 15 (adding that if a neutral state does not act impartially, the “victim” belligerent may take necessary and proportionate steps to end the violation).\n²⁵⁶ TIKK ET AL., *supra* note 18, at 83.\n²⁵⁷ Hague Convention XIII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 18 October 1907.\n²⁵⁸ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 10.\n²⁵⁹ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 12.\n²⁶⁰ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n²⁶¹ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4 (caveating the idea that a neutral nation may suspend passage of belligerent warships through its territorial seas).\n²⁶² COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n²⁶³ See Kelsey, *supra* note 28, at 1444–45 (considering the scope of the duty of neutrality; specifically, whether neutral states hold the practical methods of detecting a cyber attack).\n²⁶⁴ Kastenberg, *supra* note 26, at 56 (“A surrender of neutrality or acquiescence to belligerent activity may draw a neutral state into the conflict”).\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\nnications infrastructure. Thus, even without the physical violation of a neutral state's territory, a cyber attack may force a neutral state to become unwillingly involved.²⁶⁵\nWhy should we espouse such an impossible burden on neutrals? Nothing in the Hague Conventions suggests that a State must defend against anything less than a physical invasion of its territory. The Hague Conventions allow for warships to pass through territorial waters of a neutral and for the usage of telecommunication infrastructure. Jeffrey Kelsey in *Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare* argues that the meaning of neutrality should evolve to an “intent-based view of neutrality” so that neutrals are able to escape an impossible burden.²⁶⁶ “This view would not require the neutral state to take action to prevent the unintentional passage of the cyber weapons through its borders . . .”²⁶⁷ This is the right answer, but international law already allows for this.\nIt is an entirely different situation where a neutral State allows a belligerent to conduct attacks from its cyberspace.²⁶⁸ In these cases, the neutral needs to aggressively pursue those committing these attacks or face attack upon its own network. A neutral must also ensure that its servers are not being used for command and control of belligerent fighters. In such a case, “the server might be a valid military target because it’s being used for the communications or command and control of the enemy fighters in the areas of hostilities.”²⁶⁹ “Although every server has a physical location, the Internet is not segmented along national borders, and the enemy may gain greater tactical advantage from a server hosted half way around the world than from one located right in the middle of hostilities.²⁷⁰\nNeutrals will have to remain vigilant that belligerents do not use the servers located in their sovereign territory for command and control, or face being subject to attack. International law, however, must acknowledge that cyberspace falls under the telegraph exception to the law of neutrality, allowing electrons to freely transit cyberspace. One must remember that the law of neutrality only applies in an actual international armed conflict in cyberspace. Just because there is an international armed conflict on the ground does not necessarily mean there is a conflict in cyberspace, triggering the law of neutrality. The next section applies these concepts to the cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008.\n## VI.

Issues of Sovereignty Before considering whether the law of neutrality was violated or whether it even applied, one must look at issues of sovereignty. Since both Tulip and Google hosted Georgian websites on their servers, one can assume that Georgian citizens at least accessed these websites, if not interacted with them. These sites were on servers located in the United States without the consent of the United States government. Therefore, Georgian citizens violated the sovereignty of the United States every time they accessed these websites.²⁹¹ Unless of course, there is a right of\"transit passage,\"which would allow nationals of one State to freely transit the cyberspace of other States without the express permission of the sovereign.\n## B. Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks Assuming a right of\"transit passage\"exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality²⁹² because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks.²⁹³ The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic.²⁹⁴\"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\"²⁹⁵ Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.²⁹⁶\n\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nIn fact, a self-appointed representatives of the Russian hacker underground claimed responsibility for a “Stop Georgia” website, which was set up to coordinate some of the cyber attacks on Georgian websites.²⁹⁸ When cyber attacks cannot be sufficiently linked to ongoing hostilities, the cyber attacks cannot take on the legal classification of the physical conflict. At this point, the cyber attacks must go through their own analysis.\nIn the end, the damage was minimal — email disruptions and website unavailability.²⁹⁹ The damages were further limited by the low interconnectivity of the country.³⁰⁰ “The main damage was in limiting the nation’s possibilities to distribute information about the ongoing military conflict, in ‘making its voice heard’ to the world and in communicating with the Georgian people.”³⁰¹ The effects of the cyber attacks alone were not severe enough to amount to a “use of force” under Article 2(4) and certainly not enough to justify self-defense in response to an “armed attack” under Article 51³⁰² therefore, neither the law of armed conflict nor the law of neutrality applied.\n## C. Regardless, the Law of Neutrality Would Not Have Been Violated Even if LOAC did apply to the situation, the telegraph exception to Hague V would permit a neutral State to allow the use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.³⁰³ Of course, the level of state activism in permitting the use of telecommunications may range, from simply accepting data flow through private infrastructure to lending server space as was the case with Poland and Estonia, to actively supporting the functioning of telecommunications. Not all activities on this scale need necessarily be interpreted in a similar measure in the light of Article 8 of the Hague Convention cited above, but the smaller the degree of state activism, the less there is reason to speak of the state violating neutrality.³⁰⁴ ²⁹⁷ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁸ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁹ Kaminski, supra note 7, at 82 (distinguishing “actual damage” from the immeasurable damage that resulted from the attacks).\n³⁰⁰ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰¹ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰² Todd, supra note 16, at 91–92 (“There was no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack... The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy.”).\n³⁰³ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n³⁰⁴ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 In addition, the cyber attacks were not military operations since Russia denied all involvement and there was no actual evidence to the contrary.³⁰⁵ Therefore, the actions of the neutral States could not have interfered with military operations.³⁰⁶ Georgia also treated the cyber attacks as a computer security issue, rather than as cyberwarfare.³⁰⁷ The website that the neutral States assisted with were communication outlets and not military in nature.³⁰⁸ Finally, Hague V requires that if a neutral State allows the use of its telecommunications infrastructure by belligerents, it must do so impartially.³⁰⁹ Russia never requested any similar assistance; therefore, there is no evidence of impartiality.³¹⁰ Consequently, even if the law of armed conflict applied to the cyber attack in Georgia, the assisting States did nothing in violation of the law of neutrality.³¹¹ ## D. Cyber Cooperation The assistance by Poland, Estonia, and the United States companies has been described as a “cyber alliance.”³¹² This alliance limited the damages that the cyber attacks caused on Georgia.³¹³ The governments of Poland and Estonia supported Georgia with technical assistance and server space.³¹⁴ In addition, two private companies in the United States gave Georgia server space.³¹⁵ Since the cyber attacks were considered the work of hackers, it was a criminal problem.³¹⁶ As such, these attacks were separate from the international armed conflict, which was conducted on the ground in Georgia. It is in the interest of all States to have a global response to such criminal attacks. States should not be afraid to assist in such non-state sponsored cyber attacks, because they fear violating the law of neutrality. Cyber security is going to take a global effort to be effective.\n## VII. CONCLUSION The designers of the Internet were utopians, who created a decentralized network to withstand nuclear attack, intending it to be a domain free of government control. They believed that this new parallel world could escape the evils of government. The designers envisioned new communities\n\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n\nWith time, however, cyberspace succumbed to human nature and its malfeasance. Citizens are now looking to their sovereigns to police the bad acts occurring in cyberspace. As e-commerce has exploded in cyberspace, companies also want the protections offered by a sovereign such as stability and preservation of property rights. The free flow of information has threatened the existence of other sovereigns, who control their people through restricting and molding the information available to their citizenry.\nAs States exert control in cyberspace, borders are forming in cyberspace. These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 The UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace,³¹⁷ this is an infeasible burden.\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure. No other interpretation of the law of neutrality is feasible in cyberspace. A fear of violating the law of neutrality should not hinder State action in cyberspace.\n³¹⁷ Any future change that would allow one to control the path the packets of a message travel would destroy packet switching, one of the founding principles of the Internet."

It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself. From a more technical point of view, this is scarcely true because in its modern meaning\"neutrality\"is a legal status involving certain rights and duties. It therefore contemplates the existence of some sort of international legal system.¹ # I. INTRODUCTION Unlike the physical domains of land, sea, air, and outer space, the new man-made domain of cyberspace cannot be seen or felt for it\"is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time-space continuum.\"² Since its creation by man, cyberspace has greatly expanded the interconnectivity of the world.\"Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light.\"³ It has led to advancements in all areas of life. At the same time, however, cyberspace creates great new vulnerabilities, which have the potential to disrupt peace and stability in the world.⁴ Although cyberspace has existed for the last several decades, there are still no international rules, much less standard definitions applicable to this new domain.⁵ Utilizing cyber operations or * CDR Danielle Higson is the Director of the Cyber, Information Operations, and Intelligence Law Division of the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.”¹⁴ “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”¹⁵ Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.”¹⁶ At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons.¹⁷ Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare.¹⁸ “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.”¹⁹ This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.²⁰ ¹⁴ John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

In a situation where the “use of force” amounts to an “armed attack,” Article 51 allows a State to legally respond in self-defense with force. See U.N. Charter art. 51. If the State responds with force against the other State, there will be an international armed conflict as referred to in Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions and a state of war as referred to in the Hague Conventions. See U.N. Charter art. 2. In this paper, international armed conflict and war are used synonymously.

REV.* 1571, 1585–90 (2010).\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 Until recently, many believed in the impossibility of regulating cyberspace, because of the speed at which it transcends national boundaries. However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated.²¹ The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful.²² In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations.²³ Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it.²⁴ Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.”²⁵ While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status.²⁶ A misguided view of the law of ²¹ See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality. Part VI wraps up analyzing how States did not lose neutral status by assisting Georgia in 2008 during its cyber crisis. Before looking at how sovereignty and the law of neutrality apply in cyberspace, it is important to understand the structure and value of the Internet.\n\n---\n\n## ## VII. CONCLUSION The designers of the Internet were utopians, who created a decentralized network to withstand nuclear attack, intending it to be a domain free of government control. They believed that this new parallel world could escape the evils of government. The designers envisioned new communities\n\nVol. 6, No. 2 TRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\nWith time, however, cyberspace succumbed to human nature and its malfeasance. Citizens are now looking to their sovereigns to police the bad acts occurring in cyberspace. As e-commerce has exploded in cyberspace, companies also want the protections offered by a sovereign such as stability and preservation of property rights. The free flow of information has threatened the existence of other sovereigns, who control their people through restricting and molding the information available to their citizenry.\nAs States exert control in cyberspace, borders are forming in cyberspace. These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.\nNATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF Vol. 6, No. 2 The UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace,³¹⁷ this is an infeasible burden.\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure. No other interpretation of the law of neutrality is feasible in cyberspace. A fear of violating the law of neutrality should not hinder State action in cyberspace.\n³¹⁷ Any future change that would allow one to control the path the packets of a message travel would destroy packet switching, one of the founding principles of the Internet.",

Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks Assuming a right of\"transit passage\"exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality²⁹² because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks.²⁹³ The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic.²⁹⁴\"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\"²⁹⁵ Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.²⁹⁶\nextra_sections:None\npayload_tokens_before:9691\npayload_tokens_after:6889\ndropped_section:## A.

It is the condition of those who remain at peace while others are fighting. In this sense, the problem of neutrality is as old as war itself. From a more technical point of view, this is scarcely true because in its modern meaning \"neutrality\" is a legal status involving certain rights and duties. It therefore contemplates the existence of some sort of international legal system.¹\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nUnlike the physical domains of land, sea, air, and outer space, the new man-made domain of cyberspace cannot be seen or felt for it \"is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time-space continuum.\"² Since its creation by man, cyberspace has greatly expanded the interconnectivity of the world. \"Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light.\"³ It has led to advancements in all areas of life. At the same time, however, cyberspace creates great new vulnerabilities, which have the potential to disrupt peace and stability in the world.⁴\n\nAlthough cyberspace has existed for the last several decades, there are still no international rules, much less standard definitions applicable to this new domain.⁵ Utilizing cyber operations or\n\n* CDR Danielle Higson is the Director of the Cyber, Information Operations, and Intelligence Law Division of the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.

It “is essentially the use of networks and control systems to carry out organized disruptive, disabling, destructive or malicious attacks.”¹⁴ “Cyber warfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”¹⁵ Critical to any discussion of cyber warfare is the definition of a cyber weapon, since these instruments of destruction do not resemble traditional means of warfare. One proposal for a definition of a cyberspace weapon is “[a]ny capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.”¹⁶ At least 140 States have programs to develop cyber weapons.¹⁷ Cyber warfare has to be distinguished from cyber attacks, because not all attacks are cyber warfare.¹⁸ “A cyber attack is not an end in itself, but a powerful means to a wide variety of ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure.”¹⁹ This paper defines cyber warfare as cyber attacks between belligerents in an international armed conflict in cyberspace.²⁰\n\n¹⁴ John Weed, *Cyber Warfare: Understanding the Threat to Weapon Systems*, 9 *WEAPON SYSTEMS TECH.

    "NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\n\nUntil recently, many believed in the impossibility of regulating cyberspace, because of the speed at which it transcends national boundaries. However, States have slowly began developing domestic criminal laws to regulate the conduct of its citizenry on the Internet, leading to the realization that it is not a borderless wild frontier. With this awareness, the international community must decide how States will define, exert, and defend their sovereignty in cyberspace, while still preserving the utility of the Internet for cyber travelers. Although many, including the developers of the Internet, argued that government should stay out of cyberspace, sovereignty is essential in order to control the chaos inherent in any environment where people have total freedom to do their will.\n\nIt will be difficult to garner international support for any new regime to standardize conduct globally in cyberspace, since there is very little agreement amongst States on how cyberspace should be regulated.²¹ The only treaty thus far to police cross-border Internet harm is the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is widely viewed as unsuccessful.²² In order to try to get most nations to ratify the treaty, it utilizes vague definitions that are open to multiple interpretations.²³ Yet only two-thirds of the Council of Europe and the United States have ratified it.²⁴ Given this situation, we need to extrapolate what we can from the existing body of international law so that State action will create the customary international law of cyberspace. In its Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, the United States DoD proposes that “[c]ontinued international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms will serve to strengthen cyberspace for the benefit of all.”²⁵ While the current international law does not directly address cyberspace, States can apply the principles of international law.\n\nOver the last two decades, there has been a great deal of scholarship on the application of the law of armed conflict to cyberspace. Cyberwar has been accepted as a real possibility. With this acceptance, there has been some limited discussion on how to treat neutrality in cyberspace. What obligations does a neutral State have to remain neutral in a cyberwar? What does international law require of a belligerent in regard to a neutral State? Some scholars have warned if the United States is not careful, it could unintentionally abandon its neutral status.²⁶ A misguided view of the law of\n\n²¹ See Jack Goldsmith, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Skeptical View, FUTURE CHALLENGES IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW 5–7 (Peter Berkowitz ed. 2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Charles J.

Given the unique nature and purpose of cyberspace, a right to “transit passage” is necessary for the continued functionality of the Internet as we know it. As sovereignty is recognized in cyberspace, there is concern about violating another State’s neutrality. Only international armed conflict, however, triggers the law of neutrality. Therefore, a fear of violating neutrality should restrict actions in cyberspace only in the limited circumstances of an international armed conflict. In these circumstances, international law should acknowledge that the law of neutrality is not violated by packets merely transiting through a neutral State.\n\nIn the following sections, this paper will discuss the Internet, sovereignty, the law of armed conflict, the law of neutrality, and the 2008 cyber attacks of Georgia.

Part III explores how the international community should treat sovereignty in cyberspace and argues for the adoption of a regime of “transit passage.” Part IV looks at the relevance of the law of armed conflict in cyberspace. Part V contends that the law of neutrality only applies in cyberspace in the limited circumstances that the law of armed conflict is triggered. In those situations, it maintains that the Hague Conventions provide for the transit of electrons through cyberspace without violating neutrality. Part VI wraps up analyzing how States did not lose neutral status by assisting Georgia in 2008 during its cyber crisis. Before looking at how sovereignty and the law of neutrality apply in cyberspace, it is important to understand the structure and value of the Internet.\n\n## II. THE CENTERPIECE OF CYBERSPACE – THE INTERNET\n\n“The Net negates geometry. While it does have a definite topology of computational nodes and radiating boulevards for bits, and while the locations of the nodes and links can be plotted on plans to produce surprisingly Haussmann-like diagrams, it is fundamentally and profoundly antispatial.”³⁴ It is not a definable or describable place. Yet, one can find things within the Internet that one did not know existed nor where they were located.³⁵ “The Net is ambient – nowhere in particular but everywhere at once.”³⁶ One can access the Internet by logging on from wherever one is physically located,³⁷ placing oneself virtually in cyberspace while simultaneously remaining in the territorial sovereign of where one began the journey. While virtually exploring cyberspace, one seamlessly transcends into and across the cyberspace of other States. These unique characteristics pose a challenge for sovereignty. Although the Internet is only a subset of cyberspace, this paper primarily concentrates on the Internet in exploring how to create a regime for sovereignty in cyberspace. This section examines the characteristics of the Internet that will impact the choice of a regime.\n\n## A. The Birth of the Internet\n\nIn the interest of National Security, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) provided the funding and institutional support for the research that led to the development of the Internet.³⁸ Despite DoD’s motives, the aspirations and vision of a unique group of electrical engineers and unorthodox computer programmers, who desired to redesign the way computers worked in order to amplify human thinking and communication, designed the Internet.³⁹ Desiring to keep the Inter-\n\n³⁴ WILLIAM J.

C. R. Licklider, a psychologist at MIT, headed the program.⁴³ The DoD created ARPA with a broad mandate to fund cutting-edge research and strategically placed the Agency directly below the Secretary of Defense.⁴⁴ “Throughout the 1960s groups at various universities and research centers were funded to work on different aspects of interactive computing and networking.”⁴⁵ First, the research focused on enabling users to interact with a computer through a terminal, which then turned to connecting computers in different geographic locations to enable them to collaborate and share materials.⁴⁶ In 1965, the researchers linked a computer in Massachusetts to one in California through a telephone network, but large blocks of data caused problems when they created traffic jams.⁴⁷ A packet-switching network, which “allows for faster travel speeds, a higher volume of information, and permits the system to withstand additional stresses,”⁴⁸ still utilized today, turned out to be the solution.⁴⁹\n\nIn the fall of 1969 at UCLA, the first computer network, ARPANET, was born.⁵⁰ It was deliberately designed with “a distributed, redundant structure so that it could survive partial nuclear destruction and the knockout of military headquarters.”⁵¹ By the end of that year, four host computers connected approximately one thousand researchers around the country.⁵² The network got bigger and bigger and was utilized more for sending messages than its original purpose of sharing expensive resources among the different research centers.⁵³ In 1975, the military became interested in the network and began using it for communication.⁵⁴ In 1982, the network was split into MILNET,\n\n⁴⁰ JACK GOLDSMITH &amp; TIM WU, WHO CONTROLS THE INTERNET?, ILLUSIONS OF BORDERLESS WORLD 23 (2006) (referring to the structure of the Internet’s design as open, minimalist, and neutral because it is willing to accept any time of computer or network to join, does not require much of the computers or networks to join, and treats all applications the same).\n\n⁴¹ Id.\n\n⁴² HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n\n⁴³ HANSON, supra note 38 at 57.\n\n⁴⁴ HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (commenting the design was to ensure the project would be independent of pressures from individual services for specific projects).\n\n⁴⁵ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58 (asserting that there was interest throughout the United States of people who were eager to reinvent computing).\n\n⁴⁶ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n\n⁴⁷ See HANSON, supra note 38 at 58.\n\n⁴⁸ See Sharon R.

It exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers . . . There is no centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.⁷⁰\n\nA great deal of the functionality of the Internet is attributed to the end-to-end principle, which network architects, Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David Clark, used as their guiding principle in designing the Internet.⁷¹\n\nRather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network — to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network's core. The core is kept as simple as possible.⁷²\n\nSo any changes to the architecture of the Internet such as authentication or content filtering should not be done by changes to the network itself, but rather by applications attached to the network.⁷³\n\nThe backbone of the Internet being the packet-switching network and the common language of TCP/IP is essential to maintain the current interoperable Internet.⁷⁴ In the interest of cyber security, commercial and governmental organizations utilize firewalls to protect themselves from the evils lurking on the Internet.⁷⁵ These firewalls are applications that keep computers safe from some attacks and prevent some websites from being seen, but they do not stop the flow of electrons on the network, which crosses all State boundaries.\n\n⁶⁷ See WALKER, supra note 56, at 1095.\n\n⁶⁸ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61.\n\n⁶⁹ See HANSON, supra note 38, at 61 (“The Internet became the network of networks using this protocol.”).\n\n⁷⁰ ACLU v.

In addition to facilitating trade in other sectors, cyberspace is itself a key sector of the global economy.”82 Around the world, States’ critical infrastructures such as power distribution, telecommunications, banking, emergency services, transportation, national defense, and more are becoming ever dependent on the efficiencies offered by cyberspace.83 Stock exchanges and Air Traffic Control around the world are linked and dependent on the cyber infrastructure.84 Cyberspace has become the seas of commerce and the backbone of our global society, which demands a regime of sovereignty that will ensure the free flow of electrons currently enjoyed on the Internet.\n\n76 Julie J.C.H.

ESTABLISHING SOVEREIGNTY IN THE NEWEST FRONTIER\n\n“To Aristotle the idea of a placeless, borderless community would have seemed very strange; it appeared self-evident to him that a state — a self-governing political unit — had a definite, bounded territory in which the citizens lived and over which they exerted control.”85 Defining what constitutes sovereignty, however, is very difficult.86 Sovereignty is defined as “1. Supreme dominion, authority or rule. 2. The supreme political authority of an independent state. 3. The state itself.”87 The definition does not specify what sovereignty includes. In Article 2(4), the Charter of the United Nations speaks of protecting territorial integrity, “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”88 “Preserving state sovereignty is a vital goal of both state-based international organizations and individual countries.”89 Sovereignty, however, is treated differently in each physical domain, striking a balance between States’ interests and global needs.\n\n## A. The Essence of Sovereignty\n\n“Just as nature gives each man an absolute power over all his own limbs, the social pact gives the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty.”90 Philosophers have debated the value of sovereignty for centuries. There is the pull of the natural state of being versus the need for laws and regulations, which come with a society. Sovereignty is important for rule and order. In order to have property rights, mankind must have sovereignty. In the 1600s, the philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, discussed in his writings how society exists and why it is needed given the “state of nature.”91 He concluded that society was necessary to put rules on man in order to control his unfettered desires.92 Benedict De Spinoza, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued on his reasoning.93 In a Social Contract, Rousseau explains about different types of government and how they derive their power to govern.94 He acknowledges that man must give up his freedom to be governed, but in turn, government protects him and his possessions.95 “What man loses by the social contract is\n\n85 MITCHELL, supra note 34, at 151.\n86 Patrick W.

Although once thought to be merely an enhancement to the other existing domains, the concept of cyberspace as its own domain was recently accepted.¹⁰¹ Even though cyberspace is very different from the other naturally occurring domains, it does share some similarities.\n\n## B. Sovereignty in the Physical Domains\n\n“The global reach of the Internet, a network of networks, leads some to assume it is ungovernable since it reaches beyond national borders.”¹⁰² Similar concerns existed when mankind entered the domains of air and space.¹⁰³\n\nWhen states and individuals started developing the technological capability to enter the domains of sea, air, and outer space, strong arguments existed for each of these domains to remain free from sovereign control. However, state interests, such as trade and national security, combined with a state’s technological capabilities, ultimately prevailed over these arguments and determined the current legal status of these domains.¹⁰⁴\n\n⁹⁶ See generally JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, supra note 90 at 65.\n⁹⁷ Patrick D.

Although ultimately codified in treatises, these international regimes resulted from State practices.¹⁰⁵ Since cyberspace will most likely follow the same trajectory, current State practices in cyberspace are critical to its future.\n\ni. Land\n\nOriginally, principles of sovereignty were about controlling territory and the people in it. “During the 17th century, the concept of sovereigns as individual monarchs gave way to the Westphalian state system of governments as sovereigns.”¹⁰⁶ Since the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the international system has been dominated by the State actor, which holds exclusive authority over the land and people within its geographic boundary.¹⁰⁷ “Under [this] traditional understanding of sovereignty, [States] occupy a territorially-defined physical locus, such that ‘sovereignty’ and ‘country’ are inextricably intertwined. [States] are defined by the territory they control, and [States] possess exclusive authority over events within their borders.”¹⁰⁸ Before long, States had to decide on a regime for the seas.\n\nii. Sea\n\nThe seas, which cover “two-thirds of the world’s surface,”¹⁰⁹ originally were not controlled or owned.¹¹⁰ Over time, this led way to the high seas being open to all with sovereign States only exerting control over the territorial seas bordering its country.¹¹¹ “The evolution of the law can be seen as a response to, and a reconciliation of, the conflicting interests of the Members of the international\n\n¹⁰⁵ Franzese, supra note 86, at 29 (noting that this reliance on state practices “means that a change in state interests or technological capabilities might change the legal status of these domains”).\n¹⁰⁶ J.

Both cyber and space are global commons vital to civil and commercial activities and essential to the economy and military operations.”¹⁵⁵\n\nOne major difference, however, is the ease of accessibility of cyberspace versus space. A Master’s thesis from 1965 once asked: “where is space? [W]ho controls it?”¹⁵⁶ These are the same questions that we ask today about cyberspace.\n\n## C. Sovereignty in Cyberspace\n\nCyberspace needs the rule of law inherent in sovereignty, but it needs to be open for international transit. “As with maritime trade, the path to future prosperity relies on open access, engagement and cooperation among friends and allies in the global cyberspace commons.”¹⁵⁷ Although similar to space, cyberspace cannot be a true global commons “governed collectively for the common benefit of all mankind,”¹⁵⁸ effectively prohibiting State sovereignty. The great number of people and companies in cyberspace need rules and regulations that only a sovereign can provide. This new domain needs a navigational regime like the Law of the Sea that carefully balances the needs of national security but ensures international freedoms.¹⁵⁹ “It must recognize that the Internet is part of an international telecommunications system where freedom of access benefits all States, and to which any artificially drawn boundaries would have to be consistent with legitimate issues of national sovereignty and customary international law.”¹⁶⁰ A regime of “transit passage” can strike this balance.\n\n¹⁵¹ Robert W.

Utopian Beginnings\n\nIn the 1990s, John Perry Barlow, lyrics writer for the Grateful Dead, advocated for a separate legal regime for cyberspace, totally outside of state control.¹⁶¹ Barlow and others believed that cyberspace was “a new frontier, where people lived in peace, under their own rules, liberated from the constraints of an oppressive society and free from government meddling.”¹⁶² After President Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act into law, Barlow wrote his famous *Declaration of Cyberspace Independence*, based on the Declaration of Independence, and distributed it widely.¹⁶³\n\n“Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone . . . You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one . . . Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions . . . We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”¹⁶⁴\n\n“The belief that cyberspace should be free from government interference, or sovereignty, led to the idea that cyberspace is, in fact, immune from state sovereignty.”¹⁶⁵ However, this ideal has become very unrealistic. Although cyberspace was once believed to be free from government control and regulation, States are being to exert their control over cyberspace in order to ensure liberty.¹⁶⁶ As a result, sovereignty needs to apply in cyberspace. “We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.”¹⁶⁷ States will have to want to exert sovereignty in cyberspace and in order to do this there will have to be borders in cyberspace.

    "Vol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n19\n\n## ii. The Taming of Cyberspace\n\nOver the last decade, States have begun exerting their sovereignty in cyberspace in response to complaints from its citizens and a need to control the information seen by those citizens. Western States have exerted control on content or access to content in order to protect their citizens from child pornography, sale of Nazi paraphernalia, and other ills.¹⁶⁹ States have also had to regulate content on the Internet in order to safeguard intellectual property. Repressive states such as China and Belarus have constructed barriers to access in an effort to keep western ideals of democracy from its citizens' purview on the Internet.¹⁷⁰\n\nAs far back as 1995, the Germans prosecuted the German manager of CompuServe Deutschland for \"failing to prevent child pornography, much of which came from outside Germany, from reaching German citizens.\"¹⁷¹ Regulating local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is a key to States controlling what content its citizens can view on the Internet. Once notified of the existence of illegal content, German, British, and French laws require their local ISPs to screen out the offending content.¹⁷² This protects the citizens of those States, but it does not stop the offending content from transiting the States' cyberspace.\n\nPrior to 2000, it was believed that a State could not control an Internet provider in another State.¹⁷³ In a landmark decision, the French courts held that Yahoo, a United States corporation, violated French law by allowing Nazi paraphernalia to appear for sale on web pages accessible in France.¹⁷⁴ Acknowledging that a one hundred percent blockage was impossible, the court \"ordered Yahoo to make a 'reasonable effort' to block French users.\"¹⁷⁵ France was not blocking the websites from its cyberspace, but it was erecting a border around its citizens whom it wanted to protect from the Nazi goods being sold.\n\nAlthough China allows access to the Internet, it has carefully engineered accessible content. China \"is trying to create an Internet that is free enough to support and maintain the world's fastest growing economy, and yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on power.\"¹⁷⁶ In order to accomplish this goal, China has created a \"firewall\" popularly known as the \"Great Firewall of China\" around its people that filters and removes any unapproved information headed to a Chinese national.¹⁷⁷ In 2002, Yahoo signed the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, which requires that \"Yahoo filter materials that might be harmful or threat-\n\n---\n\n¹⁶⁹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 154–57.\n\n¹⁷⁰ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 87–104; ACCESS CONTROLLED: THE SHAPING OF POWER, RIGHTS, AND RULE IN CYBERSPACE 161–69, 449–73 (Ronald Deibert et al. eds., 2010); LESSIG, supra note 65, at 79–80, 308; see generally Fyodor Pavlyuchenko, Belarus in the Context of European Cyber Security, THE VIRTUAL BATTLEFIELD: PERSPECTIVES ON CYBER WARFARE 156, 156–62 (Christian Czosseck &amp; Kenneth Geers eds., Kenneth Geers trans. 2009), http://ccd.coe.org/publications/virtualbattlefield/11_PAVLYUCHENKO_Belorussia.pdf (censorship).\n\n¹⁷¹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n\n¹⁷² GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 73.\n\n¹⁷³ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 1–10.\n\n¹⁷⁴ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 7–8.\n\n¹⁷⁵ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 8.\n\n¹⁷⁶ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 89.\n\n¹⁷⁷ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 92–93 (outlining the process by which the \"Great Firewall of China\" filters unapproved internet information); ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.",

Thus, determined savvy Internet users are able to circumvent most, if not all, of these barriers with relative ease.¹⁷⁹\n\nE-commerce requires a stable environment controlled by a sovereign who can protect companies and consumers from fraud. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, desired to make a company self-regulated by its users, but “quickly learned that to prevent fraud, enforce its contracts, and ensure stability in its auction services, it would depend critically on government coercion and the rule of law provided by a stable country like the United States.”¹⁸⁰ Originally run by community enforcement, eBay now has a full-time security staff of over eight hundred people.¹⁸¹\n\nStates are creating boundaries in cyberspace to protect its citizens, rather than its territory. Cyber crimes are being prosecuted by States regardless of the fact that the person was not physically within the State’s territory when accessing the Internet. The United States prosecutes a man who views child pornography on the Internet while physically being in another country by using extra-territorial jurisdiction.¹⁸² “Developing sovereignty, [however,] ultimately requires an international regime with specific rules and procedures regulating state activity in that domain, including a requirement to identify and track transnational actors.”¹⁸³\n\niii. A Navigational Regime for Cyberspace – Transit Passage\n\nAs with the domains of sea, air, and space, there is a need for international space in cyberspace. “And like the seas, the U.S. will feel the need to maintain ‘freedom of navigation’ in cyberspace as a primary beneficiary of its existence.”¹⁸⁴ The networks of cyberspace need to be kept “open for the economic, social, and security interests of this country and its citizens.”¹⁸⁵ Cyberspace has provided an information-based revolution in the public, private, and military sectors.¹⁸⁶\n\nThis domain, however, is very different from the other physical domains. A State may not even be aware of someone in their cyberspace. Cyber operations occur “at computing speeds delivered at the speed of light.”¹⁸⁷ In order to physically enter a State, a traveler must present a passport; yet a cyber traveler can enter any State in cyberspace without any documents. This freedom is not something that we want to stop with the recognition of sovereignty in cyberspace. Therefore, international law needs to adopt a regime for cyberspace that allows for the free flow of electrons through all of cyberspace.\n\n¹⁷⁸ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 9.\n¹⁷⁹ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 103; ACCESS CONTROLLED, supra note 170, at 4.\n¹⁸⁰ GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129.\n¹⁸¹ See GOLDSMITH &amp; WU, supra note 40, at 129–135.\n¹⁸² LESSIG, supra note 65, at 299.\n¹⁸³ Franzese, supra note 86, at 34 (emphasizing that because cyberspace is man-made, it is necessarily influenced by politics and shaped by social actions and institutions); see also Geoffrey L.

    "Vol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n21\n\nAn international strait is a fitting analogy for Cyberspace, which has an extremely high volume of traffic that is exponentially growing.¹⁸⁸ “For cyberspace capabilities, like e-mail, the utility of the tool to each user increases exponentially as the number of people using the tool increases.”¹⁸⁹ Therefore, it is in society’s interest to keep this traffic in cyberspace free flowing, like the desire to keep the high volume of traffic transiting an international strait. There are no clear borders in cyberspace. Once a packet of information is launched into cyberspace, it is nearly impossible to tell when it passes from one sovereign to another until it finally arrives. “Although every computer, server, and wire is located in some place subject to other regulatory frameworks, the paths by which packets travel across the Internet are largely beyond the control of the user and may pass through many different sovereign jurisdictions in route from senders to recipient.”¹⁹⁰ In an international strait, the territorial seas of more than one State overlap. The public and freely accessible parts of cyberspace are like international straits connecting the sovereign territories where the hardware is located.\n\n“[T]ransit passage allows all ships and aircraft freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the international strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.”¹⁹¹ Cyberspace absolutely requires this type of framework in order not to disrupt the flow of ideas and commerce in cyberspace. “Transit passage” would allow the electrons to transit cyberspace in their normal mode of operation. No State could suspend transit passage of its cyberspace; but if it so chose, it could disconnect from the network. In addition, transit passage would apply to military operations and would allow for the transit passage through a neutral territory. The hardware, however, is actually in sovereign territory. The relationship between the physical hardware and cyberspace is similar to that of territorial waters and the high seas.\n\n“Every component of every information and telecommunications network around the world, under the sea, and in the air is subject to proprietary interests – whether that of a private company, a sovereign government, or possibly both. Each copper wire, fiber-optic cable, microwave relay tower, satellite transponder, or Internet router has been produced or installed by some entity whose legal successors not only maintain ownership of that physical asset but also expect protection of the same by sovereign authorities.”¹⁹²\n\nRecognizing a right of “transit passage” in cyberspace would merely make current State practice customary international law. Every day, States violate the sovereignty of other States as emails from one office transit across national boundaries in route to the office next door. Because of the way the Internet operates, one message can be broken up into multiple packets that travel the public Internet in the most expeditious manner regardless of path. Cyberspace knows no boundaries; packets do not request permission when transiting from one State to another.\n\n¹⁸⁸ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 51.\n¹⁸⁹ Sorensen, supra note 8, at 58; see also Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, and Benjamin Tilly, Metcalf’s Law is Wrong, IEEE SPECTRUM (July 2006), http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-iswrong.\n¹⁹⁰ Ryan et al., supra note 76, at 89.\n¹⁹¹ Barney, supra note 159, at 75.\n¹⁹² Kanuck, supra note 20, at 1573.",

Information from unauthorized users on these networks would violate territorial sovereignty. The Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) would be one example of such network. This type of regime would balance society's need for freedom of navigation of cyberspace while protecting national security.\n\nSovereignty in cyberspace is required and States will need to exert this sovereignty. It is imperative that States police crime, protect property interest, and take action against known attacks originating within its cyberspace.^[193]^ Global society is heavily reliant on the Internet's continuing functionality, which requires packets to continue surfing freely through cyberspace. In addition, States cannot currently exert territorial control over the electrons passing through its cyberspace; therefore, there is no way to enforce exclusive sovereignty in cyberspace. Consequently, States should operate in cyberspace, assuming a right of \"transit passage,\" and, with time, the practice will become a part of customary international law.\n\n## IV. APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT TO CYBERSPACE\n\nThe governance of cyberspace will require the utilization of all types of law, such as criminal law, tort law, and property law.

Additional Protocol I requires a State to review any “new weapon, means or method of warfare to ensure its employment would not violate international law.”²⁰⁰\n\nWhat activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force is the subject of much debate. “At a point along the spectrum of interstate activities called the line of belligerency, a use of force by a state establishes an international armed conflict as a matter of law and the law of armed conflict applies.”²⁰¹ Jus ad bellum is this body of international law, found in both customary and treaty law, governing a State’s resort to force against another state.²⁰² The UN Charter is the primary modern source of jus ad bellum.²⁰³ In accordance with the UN Charter, “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”²⁰⁴ In order to know what activities between states are forbidden in cyberspace, we must know what activities constitute the threat or use of force in cyberspace. In Article 51, the UN Charter offers that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”²⁰⁵ Humanity must determine what an armed attack is in cyberspace in order to know when a state has a right to protect itself. “Although a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense [under Article 51] in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.”²⁰⁶\n\napplicabilityofihltocna.pdf (applying international humanitarian law); Dunlap, supra note 21, at 81–95 (arguing basic tenets of LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT are sufficient to address cyberwar); Todd, supra note 3, at 66–102 (arguing for a definition-based approach); David E.

    "NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\n\n## B. Defining the Use of Force/Armed Attack in Cyberspace\n\nWithout defining any of the terms individually, the UN Charter uses the terms “use of force,” “armed attack,” and “aggression” in its various provisions, spurring over fifty years of debate about the terms’ meanings.²⁰⁷ Although economic and political coercion can threaten international stability, generally the use of force is understood to mean armed force.²⁰⁸ “Until the advent of information operations, most coercion could be handily categorized into one of several boxes, for few options existed that could not be typed as political, economic, or armed in nature.”²⁰⁹ Cyber attacks, however, do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Cyber attacks are launched for a multitude of reasons with a wide spectrum of effects. Therefore, it had to be determined “whether a cyber attack, because it does not involve the use of kinetic force, is a prohibited use of force under the Charter and customary international law.”²¹⁰ Michael N. Schmitt analyzed this and answered it in the affirmative, stating “the key is to move from an instrument-based paradigm (economics, politics, kinetic military force) to one based on the consequences caused by the action.”²¹¹ To help analyze the consequences of an operation, Schmitt developed seven criteria to determine whether the effects are “more like those caused by economic and political coercion or by physical coercion.”²¹²\n\nIn defining the use of force in cyberspace, most scholars look to the seven-factor analysis proposed by Michael N. Schmitt to determine a use of force.²¹³ These factors include: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and State responsibility²¹⁴ and give a qualitative analysis of how military operations differ from nonmilitary operations, such as diplomatic and economic coercion.²¹⁵ The use of force does not include non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare.²¹⁶\n\nThe next major law of armed conflict issue is evaluating when a cyber attack amounts to an “armed attack” under Article 51, allowing a State to respond with force in self-defense.²¹⁷ The previous analysis is not applicable in this determination, because “use of force” and “armed attack” is not the same.²¹⁸ Typically, cyber attacks with violent effects are the legally equivalent to armed attacks.²¹⁹ Therefore, cyber attacks utilizing cyber weapons (e.g., viruses, worms, logic bombs) and resulting in human suffering or property damage (beyond the computer program or data attacked) can be\n\n207 Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 199, at 150; SHARP, SR., supra note 2, at 73.\n208 Schmitt, supra note 195, at 908.\n209 Schmitt, supra note 195, at 908.\n210 Michael N.

In those instances, however, where there is an international armed conflict and the law of armed conflict does apply, States need to know their obligations under the law of neutrality.\n\n## V. NEUTRALITY\n\nThe designers created the Internet, as implied by its name, to be a single network to link data across States and oceans.²²⁵ In reality, the Internet is a multitude of different linked networks.²²⁶ Therefore, there is no way to predict the State or States through which a packet will travel during transmission.²²⁷ A belligerent cannot know which route its cyber attack will take on its way to its target, which makes it impossible to ensure that it does not cross a neutral’s cyberspace territory.²²⁸\n\nIn a cyberwar, how a State remains neutral has been the subject of much discourse. The primary question is whether an electron from a belligerent State crossing through a neutral State’s cyberspace territory is a violation of the law of neutrality.²²⁹ Another question is whether a neutral State is required to take action against a belligerent electron transiting its cyberspace. “More than a century after the Hague Conventions’ enactment, their general conception of neutrality remains controlling law, but international law does not explicitly address cyberattacks and cyber neutrality.”²³⁰ This paper argues that an electron passing through a neutral’s State’s cyberspace does not violate the neutral’s sovereignty and should not require action by the neutral State.²³¹ Since it appears that there is not go-\n\n220 Dörmann, supra note 195, at 4.\n221 See Dunlap, supra note 21, at 86 (recognizing the importance of neutrally assessing the consequences of a cyber incident to see if it rises to the equivalent level of an armed attack); see also Rowe, supra note 195, at 1.\n222 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 99.\n223 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 99.\n224 Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 199, at 172; Huntley, supra note 18, at 2–3 (implying that certain principles of international law do little to control states in cyber space).\n225 Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432.\n226 Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432 (“Keeping with its military roots, the Internet has a significant level of redundancy in the backbone, such that if one network experiences a problem the Internet can reroute traffic in real time to avoid it.”).\n227 See Kelsey, supra note 28, at 1432.\n228 See Lessig, supra note 65, at 63.\n229 John S.

The Law of Neutrality\n\nThe law of neutrality embodied in the Hague Conventions is basically as old as time, in the sense it is based on basic economic principles. Neutrals want to stay out of war and yet want to protect their commerce and trade routes. Belligerents need resources, which neutrals have. Since the law of neutrality has endured with little change through all of the technological revolutions of the last several centuries, there is no reason to believe the same law will not apply in cyberspace, where commerce along with communication is paramount.\n\n## i. History of Neutrality\n\nAs early as the fourteenth century and possibly even earlier, “neutrality” was applied in its modern sense.²³³ Since at least the fifteenth century, a prime objective of belligerents was the destruction of the enemy’s trade, which appears to have led to the law of neutral rights at sea.²³⁴\n\nThe problem has always been the reconciliation of the incompatible interests of neutrals and belligerents, or, rather, a compromise between these irreconcilable interests. The neutral has sought to maintain his freedom of trade; the belligerent has sought to cut off all supplies from his enemy. The desire to seize goods of the enemy may be\n\nHUMANITARIAN LAW RESEARCH INITIATIVE, COMPUTERS AND WAR: THE LEGAL BATTLESPACE 15 (2004), (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University), http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf (asserting the mere routing of data through a neutral State is allowed), with LAWRENCE T.

Therefore, there must be an international armed conflict in order for the law of neutrality to apply.²⁴⁰ Hague Convention III Relative To the Opening of Hostilities governs the beginning of hostilities.

The movement of troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies by belligerents across the territory of a neutral state is forbidden.²⁴³ Belligerents are forbidden from erecting wireless telegraphy stations or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea on the territory of a neutral state.²⁴⁴ They are further prohibited from using any of such stations erected prior to the war on the territory of a neutral state for purely military purposes, unless it has been opened for the service of public messages.²⁴⁵ These prohibitions apply only to direct communications by belligerents to their forces.²⁴⁶ A neutral State has a responsibility to prohibit such activity from being conducted on its territory.²⁴⁷ Certainly, belligerents may not launch an attack from within the telecommunication infrastructure of a neutral State.²⁴⁸ There is an exception, however, to this principle of information warfare.\n\na. Telegraph Exception\n\nA neutral State is allowed to let belligerents use telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to the neutral State or its nationals.²⁴⁹ The neutral State does, however, have to ensure any restrictions or prohibitions are applied impartially to both belligerents.²⁵⁰ The same applies for private infrastructure systems.²⁵¹ If this is the case, a belligerent may utilize the State's telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.²⁵² The level of State activism by the neutral, though, may range; the greater the degree of activism, the more likely it is a neutral State will violate its duties under the law of neutrality.²⁵³ It is one thing for private companies of a neutral State to conduct commerce with a belligerent State, and another for the State itself to assist a belligerent.²⁵⁴ As long as a neutral State impartially makes its networks available to both sides, there is no reason\n\n²⁴³ Hague Convention V Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 18 October 1907, art. 2 [hereinafter Hague V].\n²⁴⁴ Id. art. 3(a).\n²⁴⁵ Id. art. 3(b).\n²⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 195, at 208.\n²⁴⁷ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 5.\n²⁴⁸ Schmitt et al., supra note 231, at 15.\n²⁴⁹ Hague V, supra note 243, at art. 8.\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 9.\n²⁵¹ Brown, supra note 195, at 208 (explaining why there is no duty on neutral states to restrict belligerents from using its own communications systems or privately owned systems, so long as the neutral state and the privately owned systems are impartial).\n²⁵² Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n²⁵³ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (stating the more active a State is in helping a belligerent, the more likely it is violating the law of neutrality); see infra Part VI.\n²⁵⁴ Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83; see generally L.

Law of the Seas “Peaceful Passage”\n\nHague Convention XIII governs the rights and duties of neutral States in naval war.²⁵⁷ The provisions are similar to those on land, but “the neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of war-ships or prizes belonging to belligerents.”²⁵⁸ Belligerent war-ships can remain in a port or territorial water of a neutral state for up to twenty-four hours.²⁵⁹\n\nIn addition to Hague XIII, the Law of the Sea Convention provides more guidance to neutrals and belligerents in regards to the different navigational regimes.²⁶⁰ In international straits, it protects the right of transit passage, even through neutral straits.²⁶¹ Belligerent forces transiting a neutral international strait must refrain from hostile activities not incident to their transit, but they may “take defensive measures consistent with their security, including the launching and recovery of military devices, screen formation steaming, and acoustic and electronic surveillance, and may respond in self-defense to a hostile act or hostile intent.”²⁶² Once again, analogizing cyberspace to an international strait results in a potentially practical rule for international law.\n\nDue to the way the Internet is structured, it is foolhardy to prohibit a cyber weapon to peacefully pass through a neutral State’s cyberspace. In most situations, the neutral State will not even know that the electrons passed through its sovereignty.²⁶³ Nor is there much the State can do, short of severing all computer connections with other States.\n\n## B. Responsibility of a Neutral\n\nSome scholars argue that a neutral must keep electrons from a belligerent from transiting its cyberspace.²⁶⁴ These same scholars suggest that a neutral will lose its protected status if it fails to meet this impossible burden.\n\nUnder this rule, if a neutral state cannot or does not take action to halt a cyber attack, a belligerent may choose to counter by physically attacking the neutral state’s commu\n\n²⁵⁵ SCHMITT ET AL., *supra* note 231, at 15 (adding that if a neutral state does not act impartially, the “victim” belligerent may take necessary and proportionate steps to end the violation).\n\n²⁵⁶ TIKK ET AL., *supra* note 18, at 83.\n\n²⁵⁷ Hague Convention XIII Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 18 October 1907.\n\n²⁵⁸ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 10.\n\n²⁵⁹ Hague Convention, *supra* note 257, art. 12.\n\n²⁶⁰ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n\n²⁶¹ COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4 (caveating the idea that a neutral nation may suspend passage of belligerent warships through its territorial seas).\n\n²⁶² COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK, *supra* note 121, at 7-4.\n\n²⁶³ See Kelsey, *supra* note 28, at 1444–45 (considering the scope of the duty of neutrality; specifically, whether neutral states hold the practical methods of detecting a cyber attack).\n\n²⁶⁴ Kastenberg, *supra* note 26, at 56 (“A surrender of neutrality or acquiescence to belligerent activity may draw a neutral state into the conflict”).",

Thus, even without the physical violation of a neutral state's territory, a cyber attack may force a neutral state to become unwillingly involved.²⁶⁵\n\nWhy should we espouse such an impossible burden on neutrals? Nothing in the Hague Conventions suggests that a State must defend against anything less than a physical invasion of its territory. The Hague Conventions allow for warships to pass through territorial waters of a neutral and for the usage of telecommunication infrastructure. Jeffrey Kelsey in *Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare* argues that the meaning of neutrality should evolve to an “intent-based view of neutrality” so that neutrals are able to escape an impossible burden.²⁶⁶ “This view would not require the neutral state to take action to prevent the unintentional passage of the cyber weapons through its borders . . .”²⁶⁷ This is the right answer, but international law already allows for this.\n\nIt is an entirely different situation where a neutral State allows a belligerent to conduct attacks from its cyberspace.²⁶⁸ In these cases, the neutral needs to aggressively pursue those committing these attacks or face attack upon its own network. A neutral must also ensure that its servers are not being used for command and control of belligerent fighters. In such a case, “the server might be a valid military target because it’s being used for the communications or command and control of the enemy fighters in the areas of hostilities.”²⁶⁹ “Although every server has a physical location, the Internet is not segmented along national borders, and the enemy may gain greater tactical advantage from a server hosted half way around the world than from one located right in the middle of hostilities.²⁷⁰\n\nNeutrals will have to remain vigilant that belligerents do not use the servers located in their sovereign territory for command and control, or face being subject to attack. International law, however, must acknowledge that cyberspace falls under the telegraph exception to the law of neutrality, allowing electrons to freely transit cyberspace. One must remember that the law of neutrality only applies in an actual international armed conflict in cyberspace. Just because there is an international armed conflict on the ground does not necessarily mean there is a conflict in cyberspace, triggering the law of neutrality. The next section applies these concepts to the cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008.\n\n## VI.

Issues of Sovereignty\n\nBefore considering whether the law of neutrality was violated or whether it even applied, one must look at issues of sovereignty. Since both Tulip and Google hosted Georgian websites on their servers, one can assume that Georgian citizens at least accessed these websites, if not interacted with them. These sites were on servers located in the United States without the consent of the United States government. Therefore, Georgian citizens violated the sovereignty of the United States every time they accessed these websites.²⁹¹ Unless of course, there is a right of \"transit passage,\" which would allow nationals of one State to freely transit the cyberspace of other States without the express permission of the sovereign.\n\n## B. Why the Law of Armed Conflict Did Not Apply to These Cyber Attacks\n\nAssuming a right of \"transit passage\" exists, this analysis turns to the issue of neutrality. First, law of armed conflict did not apply to the cyber attacks and therefore neither did the law of neutrality²⁹² because the cyber attacks were not sufficiently linked to the international armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although law of armed conflict clearly applied to the physical cross-border conflict involving armed forces, this does not necessarily mean that law of armed conflict would apply to the cyber attacks.²⁹³ The application of law of armed conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks is highly problematic.²⁹⁴ \"The objective evidence of the case is too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.\"²⁹⁵ Although the media targeted Russia as being behind the DDoS or defacement attacks, there is no conclusive proof as to who was behind the attacks; some experts are even skeptical that the Russian government played any role.²⁹⁶\n\n288 Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 26, at 60 (asking whether the Georgian case impacted America's status as a cyber neutral and, more broadly, whether the United States can remain neutral during a cyber conflict).\n\n289 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83 (\"the fact that a neutral state permits use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment does not automatically entail breach of neutrality for that state.\").\n\n290 Tikk et al., supra note 18, at 83.\n\n291 This may seem improbable since Georgia is an ally of the United States and it is hard to believe the United States would object to an ally transiting its cyberspace.

    "Vol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n33\n\nThere is no doubt regarding the involvement of the Russian hacker community in the cyber attacks: the coordination of and support to the attacks took place mainly in the Russian language and was conducted on Russian or Russia-friendly forums. However, there is no evident link to the Russian administration, and the Russian government has denied any involvement in the cyber assaults. The Project Grey Goose team was unable to find, in their research into the Russian hacker sites, any references to state organizations guiding or directing attacks.²⁹⁷\n\nIn fact, a self-appointed representatives of the Russian hacker underground claimed responsibility for a “Stop Georgia” website, which was set up to coordinate some of the cyber attacks on Georgian websites.²⁹⁸ When cyber attacks cannot be sufficiently linked to ongoing hostilities, the cyber attacks cannot take on the legal classification of the physical conflict. At this point, the cyber attacks must go through their own analysis.\n\nIn the end, the damage was minimal — email disruptions and website unavailability.²⁹⁹ The damages were further limited by the low interconnectivity of the country.³⁰⁰ “The main damage was in limiting the nation’s possibilities to distribute information about the ongoing military conflict, in ‘making its voice heard’ to the world and in communicating with the Georgian people.”³⁰¹ The effects of the cyber attacks alone were not severe enough to amount to a “use of force” under Article 2(4) and certainly not enough to justify self-defense in response to an “armed attack” under Article 51³⁰² therefore, neither the law of armed conflict nor the law of neutrality applied.\n\n## C. Regardless, the Law of Neutrality Would Not Have Been Violated\n\nEven if LOAC did apply to the situation, the telegraph exception to Hague V would permit a neutral State to allow the use of its telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.³⁰³\n\nOf course, the level of state activism in permitting the use of telecommunications may range, from simply accepting data flow through private infrastructure to lending server space as was the case with Poland and Estonia, to actively supporting the functioning of telecommunications. Not all activities on this scale need necessarily be interpreted in a similar measure in the light of Article 8 of the Hague Convention cited above, but the smaller the degree of state activism, the less there is reason to speak of the state violating neutrality.³⁰⁴\n\n²⁹⁷ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁸ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 75.\n²⁹⁹ Kaminski, supra note 7, at 82 (distinguishing “actual damage” from the immeasurable damage that resulted from the attacks).\n³⁰⁰ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰¹ TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 78.\n³⁰² Todd, supra note 16, at 91–92 (“There was no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack . . .

Cyber Cooperation\n\nThe assistance by Poland, Estonia, and the United States companies has been described as a “cyber alliance.”³¹² This alliance limited the damages that the cyber attacks caused on Georgia.³¹³ The governments of Poland and Estonia supported Georgia with technical assistance and server space.³¹⁴ In addition, two private companies in the United States gave Georgia server space.³¹⁵ Since the cyber attacks were considered the work of hackers, it was a criminal problem.³¹⁶ As such, these attacks were separate from the international armed conflict, which was conducted on the ground in Georgia. It is in the interest of all States to have a global response to such criminal attacks. States should not be afraid to assist in such non-state sponsored cyber attacks, because they fear violating the law of neutrality. Cyber security is going to take a global effort to be effective.\n\n## VII. CONCLUSION\n\nThe designers of the Internet were utopians, who created a decentralized network to withstand nuclear attack, intending it to be a domain free of government control. They believed that this new parallel world could escape the evils of government. The designers envisioned new communities\n\n305 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n306 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 83.\n307 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n308 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n309 Hague V, supra note 243, art. 8–9 (seeing the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telecommunications infrastructure).\n310 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n311 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 84.\n312 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266 (using this terms to explain how these nations helped Georgia mitigate the consequences of the cyber attacks, through the help of resources).\n313 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266.\n314 McGavran, supra note 199, at 266.\n315 TIKK ET AL., supra note 18, at 77.\n316 See generally McGavran, supra note 199, at 262 (explaining that criminal syndicates rent hijacked computers to the highest bidder for a low price, around four cents).",
    "Vol. 6, No. 2\nTRANSITING THE SEAS OF CYBERSPACE\n35\n\nin cyberspace would develop better ways of regulating conduct than traditional government. In the beginning, it appeared that this new domain was borderless and beyond the control of States.\n\nWith time, however, cyberspace succumbed to human nature and its malfeasance. Citizens are now looking to their sovereigns to police the bad acts occurring in cyberspace. As e-commerce has exploded in cyberspace, companies also want the protections offered by a sovereign such as stability and preservation of property rights. The free flow of information has threatened the existence of other sovereigns, who control their people through restricting and molding the information available to their citizenry.\n\nAs States exert control in cyberspace, borders are forming in cyberspace. These borders, however, are much different than the boundaries of a State's territory. They are jurisdictional boundaries affixed around each individual citizen of a state. China controls, through various measures, what its citizens can access on the Internet, but it does not stop electrons from crossing through its cyberspace. Determined Chinese nationals are still able to access this prohibited content. The United States has prosecuted its citizens who have committed illegal acts in cyberspace even though they were physically in another country when they connected to cyberspace. These boundaries are not defining physical territory in cyberspace, but rather allowing sovereigns to exert control on their citizens. They permit a sovereign to protect its citizens from prohibited information of one sort or another, whether it is child pornography or democratic principles.\n\nLike other global commons, cyberspace as we know it has value for all States. The Internet and e-commerce have allowed business to occur around the world in an instant and have opened hard-to-reach markets. Cyberspace has been a great equalizer between big and small States. It is in the interest of most States for cyberspace and the Internet to exist as it is today. Unlike other global commons, however, cyberspace needs regulations and policing, partly because of its accessibility to all people.\n\nCyberspace is not naturally occurring and its architecture can be changed and is being changed all the time, but the original design of the Internet, which allows packets to freely travel from one point to another and automatically reroute to avoid traffic, must remain. The best analogy compares cyberspace to the international straits of the sea. In order to continue the current functionality of the Internet, international law must acknowledge a right of transit passage in cyberspace. This would actually be nothing more than establishing a State practice based on current norms. Citizens of one State violate the sovereignty of other States virtually every time they access the Internet. Given the design of the Internet, an email sent from one person in State X to another person in State X can transit States Y and Z in route. This State practice needs to be institutionalized.\n\nInternational law in the other domains developed over time and technology developed to fit the needs of States. Cyberspace is like no other domain. Although there is no way to control the flow of electrons in cyberspace and maintain the functioning of the Internet as we know it today, there are ways to control what content a person sees. A sovereign should be able to control the impact of the content of the Internet on its people. But as a world, there is a need to keep the backbone of the Internet alive. A right of transit passage would accomplish both objectives by allowing sovereigns to regulate their national cyberspace, while at the same time permitting electrons to freely transit cyberspace.",
    "NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF\nVol. 6, No. 2\n\nThe UN Charter outlaws war, but States still continue to have armed conflicts. States utilize every domain in these conflicts; there is no reason to believe the domain of cyberspace is any exception. Cyber warfare, however, may offer a way for States to battle without killing. If we are going to have war, we should not discourage the use of cyberspace, which can reduce the kinetic effects of war. Given the fact that cyberwar is possible, most scholars agree that the law of armed conflict should apply in cyberspace.\n\nMost States are currently conducting different types of cyber operations. With the growing acceptance of international law applying in cyberspace, law abiding States are worrying about potentially violating another State's neutrality. Since electrons take the fastest route on the Internet, a State cannot know whether a cyber operation will navigate through the cyberspace of a neutral State en route to its destination. Most military operations can occur without worrying about the law of neutrality since there is not an international armed conflict. The possibility of violating another State's sovereignty, however, is still an issue. Unless there is a right of transit passage, a State needs the permission of another State before its electrons transit through the other State's cyberspace. Since it is currently impossible to control the path of an electron through cyberspace,³¹⁷ this is an infeasible burden.\n\nIn an international armed conflict in cyberspace, the law of neutrality applies. Prior to evaluating the rights and obligations of neutrals and belligerents under the law of neutrality, the issue of sovereignty must be addressed. If the electrons of one State cannot transit another State without violating that State's sovereignty, then the law of neutrality is irrelevant. If there is a right of transit passage in cyberspace, then international law can address the rights and responsibilities of a neutral State under the law of neutrality. The law does not prohibit the electrons from a belligerent State from transiting though a neutral State and it does not require a neutral State to stop these electrons from transiting its cyberspace as long as it impartially allows all belligerents to use its cyber infrastructure. No other interpretation of the law of neutrality is feasible in cyberspace. A fear of violating the law of neutrality should not hinder State action in cyberspace.\n\n³¹⁷ Any future change that would allow one to control the path the packets of a message travel would destroy packet switching, one of the founding principles of the Internet."
