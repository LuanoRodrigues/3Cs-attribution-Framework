Despite the clear threat, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of cyberspace, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and conceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over other competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.\n\nWhen Thucydides wrote of envisioned dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, in 400 B.C, one cannot help but wonder whether he knew his words would influence thinking on power and conflict for centuries. A single quote from this Athenian general can be claimed the very progenitor of international relations theory: \"The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\"¹ This anarchic nature of the international political system creates an inherent danger and drives states to concern themselves primarily with power and security.² While the realities of the 21st century have not changed this natural tension between states, they have changed the tactics and strategies states employ. Between great powers, nuclear weapons offer no realistic positive political objective, and the utility of traditional military force has been reduced due to the perceived risk of escalation\n\nThis is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

Certainly, any deterrence strategy should account for the unique motives, costs, and risks of specific undesirable adversary behavior. For example, Russian state-led efforts to destabilize US institutions and manipulate the electorate involve benefits, costs, and risks that are distinct in scope, scale, and influence when compared to a non-state actor's relatively simplistic employment of ransomware to obtain economic resources. To influence an adversary's decision calculus and deter undesirable behavior, deterrence strategies should be deliberately catered to these unique considerations. The question is, then: Of the myriad ways China uses cyberspace in the pursuit of its national interests, what specific behavior should the US seek to deter?\n\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

The thinking amongst the technological elite was that expanded connectivity, access to information, and unrestricted digital speech would have a liberalizing influence on the world, tempering and marginalizing authoritarian rule. Unfortunately, China quickly recognized the Internet's potential for unregulated free speech and uncontrolled proliferation of information, which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as existential threats to party security, control, and legitimacy.⁶ In response, by implementing measures such as the \"Great Firewall,\" as well as state-leveraged intermediary liability and a state-controlled information technology industry, the CCP has managed to turn the Internet into a massive tool of domestic surveillance and censorship.⁷ While this state behavior is at odds with the values of American democratic society, it should not be the primary focus of deterrence.\n\nChina's second priority in cyberspace, espionage, is complicated by matters of moral authority and legitimacy. The US, having significantly shaped and influenced the current rules-based international order, is committed to the norms and laws of the system and seeks to maintain international support through action that is consistent with its principles. James Clapper, then Director of National Intelligence, stated in 2015 that in cyberspace \"there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack.\"⁸ This recognition that the US conducts cyber espionage tacitly acknowledges the legitimacy of espionage in cyberspace. It also tangentially supports both the idea that espionage is a sovereign right and the belief that espionage has a fundamentally stabilizing influence in the international system, as improved awareness of adversary capabilities can temper expectations of benefit from the use of force. While the US should expect states to continue cyber espionage, a policy of deterrence would be manifest hypocrisy.\n\nWe then consider China's third priority in cyberspace—access to technology. China has demonstrated an extensive willingness and ability to exploit and access public and private networks worldwide in the pursuit of information and IP, particularly defense-related or technologically innovative R&amp;D.⁹ China's IP theft should not be dismissed as merely a private sector or economic concern. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center emphasizes this in its 2018 annual report, depicting foreign economic and industrial espionage as a significant threat to US prosperity, security, and competitive advantage.¹⁰ China's ability to reap the benefit of massive American investments in military and commercial R&amp;D diffuses US relative power within the international system. It also allows China to negate one of the most consequential competitive advantages of America's democratic, capitalist system over China's authoritarian, state-planned economy—the innovative forces of economic incentive in an open-market system.¹¹\n\nSPRING 2023 | 121\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

The speed and operational tradecraft, as well as the breadth and diversity of targets involved, strain Washington's ability to appreciate the scope and scale of the collective impact to US national interests. For the sake of comparison, the military is quite proficient at contextualizing the direct, tangible threat that adversary military forces pose to national security. Weapon system ranges, hypersonic weapon speeds, operational reach, and force projection are all relatively easily understood and measured concepts that translate well to traditional conceptualizations of threats to national security. What is more difficult to measure, and thereby contextualize in degree and severity of vulnerability and effect, is the cumulative impact of comparatively abstract grey zone threats and attacks that target the intersection of security and other national interests.\n\nFor example, Russian social media disinformation and misinformation efforts target a state's national psyche, polarizing the electorate and undermining a democratic state's ability to achieve political and social consensus by exploiting the seams among freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and national security. Chinese IP theft exploits a different vulnerability: the seams among national security, commercial enterprise, and economic prosperity. When adversaries target these seams, they create not only uncertainty about the extent of what is happening but also an inability or unwillingness to coordinate and execute the type of assertive, credible, associative, and timely national response needed to achieve deterrence. Yet, purely with respect to economic prosperity and relative power, the collective costs of cyberattacks may very well compete with or outweigh the net costs of any war in US history.\n\n# CYBERSPACE: UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON\n\nTo improve the conceptual foundations needed to deliver policies and strategies that could realistically create the conditions needed for deterrence, the US must first expand how it views the phenomenon of cyberspace. Throughout much of the 21st century, the government and military communities debated the question of whether or not cyberspace is a domain of warfare, equal in status and warfighting significance to the maritime, land, air, and space domains.[12] This particular question appears to be at least partially resolved, with the military's position apparent in its definition of \"cyberspace\" in Joint Publication 3-12: \"the domain [emphasis added] within the information environment that consists of the interdependent network of information technology (IT) infrastructures and resident data.\"[13]\n\nA myopic focus on the military aspects of cyberspace is insufficient for the US to pursue and defend its national interests. While cyberspace certainly creates opportunities and vulnerabilities during war, it also offers US enemies a low-cost opportunity to pursue their strategic interests during peace, entirely negating the coercive and deterrent influences of US economic and military might. This ability of a state or an individual actor to pursue their interests through cyberspace, unthreatened and unimpeded by any relative power asymmetries that\n\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Instead, the US must view cyberspace as a broad and interconnected spectrum that supports and enables the sources and instruments of national power across the entire continuum of competition to conflict on a geopolitical—not just a military—battlefield.\n\nYet, the continued evolution of war, and therefore the military instrument of national power, has resulted in a US military that performs functions and duties that go well beyond traditional armed conflict. From nation-building, including the construction of schools and hospitals or training of judges and politicians in Afghanistan, to humanitarian assistance, disaster recovery, and agricultural development in Africa, the military is no longer a simple hammer, but has become a geopolitical multi-purpose tool.¹⁵ However, while the modern US military is capable of far more than applying conventional force in the pursuit of political objectives, this does not change the fact that it is still built primarily for war. This belligerent purpose not only influences military culture, recruitment efforts, virtues, and norms, but drives how the military trains and disciplines itself, educates its leaders, and is entirely deterministic in how it identifies, prioritizes, develops, and acquires its capabilities. War is not merely what the military plans for but shapes the very process that the military uses to plan.\n\nWithin game theory, a finite game is one in which either the rules of the game or the incentives of the players serve to ensure that the game ends with clear winners and losers. Since nations in an armed conflict seek or are generally incentivized to end the conflict, a declared period of war is a finite game. Geopolitical competition between the US and China, however, is an infinite game, since it is reasonable to assert that neither party is sufficiently incentivized realistically to seek a permanent and definitive culmination of the competition.¹⁶ Instead, both parties seek to establish and exploit their own competitive advantages while avoiding or negating their opponent's comparative strengths. Understanding the temporal character of both competition and conflict should inform, if not determine, the dominant strategies of the game, influencing how players think about time, resources, maneuver, and objectives. The macro trends of twenty-first century competition and conflict thus far indicate that while the nature of cyberspace provides actors with ample opportunity for influence, espionage, exploitation, and subversion, the environment is significantly less conducive to coercion than other domains.\n\nSPRING 2023 | 123\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Despite a decade of politicians, military leaders, academics, and pundits alike predicting a future conflict largely decided by cyber means, it does not appear that Russia mounted a consequential cyber offensive as part of its invasion. This has caused some to doubt the current or future strategic utility of cyberspace.[17] However, prudence demands caution before making definitive statements or attempting conclusions regarding Russia's failure, as both time and declassification are equally likely to disprove many seemingly factual observations. If Russia has employed cyberspace capabilities as part of its invasion of Ukraine, very few observers have the means to observe and assess their impact sufficiently, or understand the degree that commercial, state, or non-state entities aided in the defense of Ukrainian cyberspace.\n\nWhether Russia failed to develop, integrate, and deliver strategically consequential cyber effects, or the Microsoft, Anonymous, and NATO-supported community-based cyberspace defense efforts succeeded in neutralizing those effects, both potentialities provide logical support to the argument that cyberspace is better suited to geopolitical conflict than war. Russia has demonstrated the ability, when unconstrained by time and comparatively broad in its desired targets or effects, to shut down national electric grids as part of a broader geopolitical effort to destabilize its opponents or competitors.[18] In contrast, it appears that Russia has learned that during war—or a finite game—it needed to count on the effectiveness of specific capabilities and effects against a narrowly defined set of targets on a specific timeline. While military capabilities like tanks, bombers and aircraft carriers offer military planners the ability to predict or make realistic assumptions about the types of effects the military can deliver on a particular timeline, capabilities and vulnerabilities in cyberspace are often ephemeral, offering much less predictability or reliability over time.\n\nBy comparison, objectives during geopolitical competition are not as often constrained by time, do not always include narrowly defined targets, or demand discrete or tailored effects. Russia's ability to influence the 2016 US election was not only the result of years of effort, but the nature of the political objective meant that Russian actors in cyberspace had nearly unlimited targets and potential effects they could reasonably claim to be influencing the election. Additionally, as is often the case with well-conceived information operations, the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which Russia compromised the election created additional division and distrust within the electorate. Russia also had the benefit of rehearsals for its techniques, having targeted several elections in Belarus, Ukraine, and, of course, its own internal elections since 2007.[19]\n\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Washington should carefully reconsider the wisdom of leaning too heavily on its finite-game player (the military) to counter China's infinite-game strategy, while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of whether the US seeks to win, or out-compete, before establishing policies or strategies that direct how it uses national resources to play the game.\n\nRegardless, if deterrence—or the ability to dissuade Beijing from certain behavior because the perceived benefits do not justify the perceived costs and risks—is the objective of US policy regarding Chinese IP theft, this will require the ability to influence CCP perceptions and intention.²⁰ Targeting and influencing perception requires both capability and credibility. However, before discussing strategies for using capability and credibility to influence perception and intention, it must be understood that existing deterrence theory was developed largely to deter aggression.²¹\n\nWithin the context of international relations, as well as deterrence theory, aggression is most often a matter of the coercive threat or use of force between states. Yet, it is exceedingly counterproductive to limit the conversation of cyberattacks to this narrow context, not only because most attacks in cyberspace offer poor analogical parallel to the concept of force in the physical world, but also because force is not defined in the United Nations (UN) Charter. To date neither the US nor China—despite overwhelming evidence of cyberattacks that undermine their national interests and threaten the security of their critical infrastructure—has invoked the protection of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibiting the use of force. That neither state has claimed this protection supports the assertion that most cyberattacks should not be considered within the context of military force employment.\n\n## NO LAWS OF UNARMED CONFLICT: REVISITING OUR THEORIES, LAWS, AND CONCEPTS\n\nWithout international consensus characterizing the preponderance of state behavior in cyberspace as \"force,\" logic should then demand skepticism among cyber policymakers regarding the wholesale applicability, and advisability of deference to, existing theories, laws, and norms surrounding the conventional use of force to competition or conflict in cyberspace. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), for instance, is a body of international law intended to limit humanitarian impacts caused during the use of force between states. If there is no existing law or normative international agreement characterizing state cyberattacks against other states as force, what is the virtue or value of allowing restraining concepts like proportionality, distinction, or military necessity to interfere with the defense—or pursuit, for that matter—of national interests in cyberspace? Why would the US elect to conduct the cognitive gymnastics necessary to frame cyberattacks within the context of LOAC?

While there remains insufficient international consensus to establish the type of norms needed to constrain state behavior, insistence upon applying the constraints of LOAC is diffusing US relative power and restraining US ability to deter aggression in cyberspace.\n\nExtant deterrence theory and policies should be viewed with similar skepticism. Classical deterrence theory, devised to disincentivize the aggressive use of force between states, may prove insufficient in deterring the unique forms of aggressive state behavior seen in cyberspace. In their book *Cross-Domain Deterrence*, Jon R. Lindsey and Erik Gartzke note that classic deterrence theory is itself a historical product of a particular technological innovation—nuclear weapons—and cast doubt on the theory's application to the emergence of new technologies.[22]\n\nThe unique nature of cyberspace, and the fledgling historical record of competition and conflict therein, also gives reason to question strategic assumptions regarding the propensity for escalation, both within cyberspace as well as the cross-domain variety. In *The Perfect Weapon*, David Sanger notes that one reason the US cannot figure out how to counter cyberattacks is its belief that response incurs a great risk of escalation.[23] However, hesitation by the US to respond to attacks in cyberspace over concerns of escalation is poorly founded, based more on sentiment and abstraction than historical or empirical evidence. To the contrary, two decades of state competition and conflict in cyberspace suggest that a rational actor in the current international system will not use traditional military force as a response to cyberattacks that deliver only economic or information effects. To attribute the observed lack of proliferation in kinetic effects delivered through cyberspace to some inherently deterrent influence of cyberpower itself is logically lacking, as the cyber domain in that situation becomes merely a medium for cross-domain kinetic effect.\n\nIt is also logically consistent that the effects of conventional deterrence would have cross-domain influence, deterring escalation from cyber effect to kinetic action both internally and externally to the cyber domain. It stands to reason that any cyberattack that delivers armed attack equivalent effects will be treated by a state no differently than conventional force employment. In such a case, the medium of delivery is logically relevant, but should be inconsequential, as there would be little rational reason for a state to treat such an attack any differently than the use of land, maritime, or air power to deliver conventional force.\n\nIt can also be counterproductive to constrain thinking on national cybersecurity to extant military theory or doctrine. For instance, the wisdom of Clausewitz contributes to the theoretical foundations of belligerency the assertion that between two parties with equal means, defense is not only easier than attack but is the stronger and more superior form of fighting.[24] Here it should be noted that Clausewitz differentiates between \"pure defense,\" or the act of waiting for a blow that permanently leaves the initiative with the enemy, and \"relative defense,\" which encompasses both defensive and offensive maneuver for the purpose of either attriting the enemy or deliberately manipulating time and/or space in order to negate an enemy's temporal\n\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

In cyberspace pure defense—static defense measures such as firewalls, antivirus scanners, personal security products, and other automated security tools employed and monitored by system administrators and network defenders—certainly has an important place in geopolitical competition, conflict, and war.\n\nClausewitz’s characterization of the asymmetries of interest and the nature of interplay between the offense and defense, as well as other supporting arguments for the general superiority of the defense, also apply inconsistently to conflict in cyberspace. The unique aspects of cyberspace, including the inherent obfuscation of identity, the relative ease of concealing digital presence and activities, the lack of geographic buffers, and the compression of both time and distance, combine to provide distinct advantages to the attacker over the defender.²⁶ In an infinite game, the advantages of maneuver, objective, initiative, economy of force, unity of command, simplicity, speed, and surprise all belong to the offense.\n\nWhile the debate over the comparative advantages of offense or defense in cyberspace is unlikely to culminate in foreseeable future, the 21st century experience suggests that while the best defense in cyberspace might require some offensive action, deterrence in cyberspace will undoubtedly require both. Deterrence by denial—or lowering an adversary’s expectation of success—is supported through improved cybersecurity and defensive measures intended to frustrate, mitigate, or prevent cyberattacks. Yet, there are dual asymmetries to resolve in deterring IP theft through cyberspace. First, the fundamental and inherent asymmetry between the significant potential benefits and comparatively low costs and barriers to entry makes it difficult to deter IP theft exclusively through defense. This, combined with an asymmetry of vulnerability created by US commitment to open societies, capitalist market-based economies, and global interdependency, makes it unlikely that defense alone can achieve deterrence.\n\nThe fact that China’s IP theft occurs within an infinite game only compounds this reality. In an infinite game, the low cost of offense and significant financial and manpower costs of defense make it is unrealistic to expect defense alone to reduce state perceptions of benefit sufficiently to a level that achieves deterrence over time. While the continued maturation of security-focused network architectures such as zero-trust, as well as increased integration of automation or even artificial intelligence, may with time improve the effectiveness of defense and cybersecurity, there is little reason to doubt that offensive techniques and attack capabilities will be similarly improved in the time needed to implement these defensive measures. Yet, when reduced perception or likelihood of benefit is combined with increased perception of costs and risks, achieved through consistent and credible punishment, deterrence might be possible.\n\nOn top of the need to critically evaluate the applicability of existing theory, laws, and norms to cyberspace, it is prudent to reflect on US cyber policy, as the credibility of US national response to Chinese IP theft has been constrained by a variety of policy and bureaucratic\n\nSPRING 2023 | 127\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Since 2011, options for decisive offensive cyber operations in response to cyberattacks have been presented regularly to national leadership. A common objection to offensive operations, often coming from the U.S. Intelligence Community, is that offensive action poses risk to intelligence collection capabilities while delivering only a limited or short-lived benefit.29 However, consistent deference to this view has destroyed Washington's ability to establish the credibility needed to deter cyber aggression. The predictability of the US strategic preference for economic stability, diplomatic influence, and intelligence collection over deterrence in cyberspace inexorably undermines its own credibility.\n\nWhile strategic culture is certainly an obstacle, the challenge of attribution also constrains US thinking and consistency of action in cyberspace.30 Cyber attribution, the process of identifying and laying blame on the actor of a cyberattack, is strained by many unique aspects of cyberspace itself. The logical rules that govern how networked devices communicate serve to obfuscate identity in a way that is understandably confusing to a lawyer or a politician, but much less so to a trained cyber professional. The challenge of convincing non-technical policy and decision-makers of the significance and accuracy of cyber forensics evidence has certainly contributed to a decade of failure deterring aggression in cyberspace. The US must mature not only its understanding of attribution, but its willingness to act in situations of attributional uncertainty, if the nation is to achieve the consistency of action needed for deterrence.\n\nThere are five “elements” of attributing action in cyberspace, including persona, geopolitical, geographic, logical, and physical layers. Each element can be independently and definitively determined through advanced cyber forensics. An in-depth articulation of the nuances of each element is not needed to understand the greater point: the US should reject the thinking that all five elements of attribution must be satisfied to justify action in response to cyberattacks. Currently, US decision-makers are holding attribution for actions in cyberspace to an unnecessarily high standard when each singular element of attribution offers a unique objective justification for a wide variety of potential national response actions. In other domains, decisions regarding US military action are often made based on comprehensive, multi-factor intelligence assessments. The same type of assessment is possible in cyberspace.\n\n## ADDRESSING THE CONSTRAINTS OF ATTRIBUTION\n\nA multi-factor cyberspace attribution assessment would combine cyber forensics evidence with an analysis of the historical records of cyberattacks, economic and geopolitical",

This framework would deliberately allow for some subjectivity, including an assessment of whether a cyberattack is consistent with enemy state interests, previously attributed cyberattacks, or known state cyber capabilities and signatures. Combining objective forensics evidence with subjective intelligence analysis should serve to improve the comfort level of decision-makers in approving and directing timely and decisive action in response to cyberattacks.\n\nThe US cyber response playbook should include the widest possible variety of punitive and responsive legal, diplomatic, informational, economic, and military actions. Such actions should include international or domestic indictment, as well as the colloquial \"name and shame\" brand of embarrassing public statements and condemnation. In 2015, President Obama demonstrated that the evidence of cyberattacks can be used quite effectively as leverage during diplomatic or trade negotiations.[31] The US should also expand its use of economic punishment measures to target the material interests of not only national governments, but also private commercial entities that enable enemy cyberattacks. In addition, of course, the US can use overt, covert, or clandestine offensive cyberspace operations for a wide variety of deliberate effects. Each of these potential responses receives a unique degree of logical support from the individual elements of attribution.\n\nFor example, consider a cyberattack in which the US can definitively identify the physical devices used during an attack, as well as the geographic location—in, such as China—of the equipment during the attack. Without the ability to attribute the persona element or geopolitical association (individual hacktivist versus government-sanctioned operative) of the attacker, it is perfectly reasonable to take certain playbook options, like indictment, off the table. However, given the location of the attack origin, this partial attribution offers at least some value as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, while actions targeting the device(s) or the material interests of any identified enablers would also be justified. For the sake of contrast, in the less common scenario in which the identity and geopolitical association of an attacker can be attributed, the entire playbook should be viewed as available, with or without definitive attribution of the physical or logical layers of the equipment used during the attack.\n\nYet, obfuscation of identity is only one way that the challenge of attribution strains a state's ability to deter aggression in cyberspace. Not only is it possible for a skilled cyber actor to obfuscate or destroy digital evidence of their presence and actions, but attributional efforts are further frustrated by the pace of technological change, the inherent and real-time customizability of cyberspace capabilities, and the omnipresent need for secrecy to protect both capabilities and a state's awareness of adversary vulnerabilities. The consequence here is that attributing action in cyberspace will, for the foreseeable future, undermine the type of timely, transactional, and associative punitive response needed to sufficiently signal to adversaries a correlation between cause and effect.\n\nSPRING 2023 | 129\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

With the nature of cyberspace naturally complicating timely response, perhaps deterrence in cyberspace demands that states evolve thinking beyond transactional tit-for-tat responses to seemingly isolated incidents of cyberattacks, and instead respond comprehensively to the collective and cumulative impacts of an adversary's actions to the state's national interests.\n\nLucas Kello, the director of the Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, expands upon this idea in his 2021 article in the Journal of Cybersecurity: \"Cyber Legalism: why it fails and what to do about it.\" In the article, Kello articulates four principles that should inform better doctrine for cyber conflict. His first principle, the \"accretional principle,\" suggests that states should treat attacks as strategic campaigns, not individual actions.[32] If cyberattacks were punished cumulatively, it would allow a state to target the psychological component of adversarial decision making without the constraints of time, possibly even reducing the burden of attribution through aggregation. Similar to the Clausewitzian notion of relative defense, a strategy that observes the accretional principle would allow the victim of cyberattacks to maintain initiative by delivering penalties in a concentrated fashion and controlling key conditions of the interaction—namely time and location. This effectively enables the defender to determine, and when desirable obfuscate, the threshold of aggregate harm that triggers punishment. The \"many possible permutations of punishable actions and their attendant penalties give the defender a wide scope of maneuver,\" introducing the type of uncertainty that should complicate an adversary's risk-benefit analysis. Well-executed, the ability to deliberately create uncertainty could reasonably cause an adversary to guess conservatively about the location of the line of response, delivering a deterrent effect on the utilization of cyberattack.[33]\n\n# OBSTACLES AND IMPEDIMENTS: COMPETING INTERESTS AND POOR NATIONAL UNITY OF EFFORT\n\nIf deterrence demands both capability and credibility, then why has deterrence failed in cyberspace? While the US is the \"world's stealthiest, most skilled cyber power,\"[34] since 2006, it has also been the target of more significant cyberattacks than the next seven countries combined.[35] Despite possessing tremendous cyber capabilities and capacity—military and commercial alike—the US is not feared in cyberspace.[36] While this observation demands a theory-based articulation of whether the nature of cyberspace complicates or precludes coercion, such an endeavor is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, it is enough to simply observe that while China is undoubtedly aware of US cyber capabilities, it is increasingly convinced of Washington's lack of resolve to use those capabilities to punish its behavior.[37] However, even if the US can broaden its view of cyberspace, resolve the limitations of its strategic culture, expand its view of attribution, and deliver a strategy that increases its willingness to act, certain obstacles and impediments still weaken the foundations of US deterrent potential in cyberspace.\n\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

When Google executives were notified in 2009 that the Chinese had compromised their systems, they waited nearly a year to acknowledge the attack publicly. Moreover, Google did not reveal the full extent of the exposure; a server used to store court orders from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had also been compromised. Google's response was not unusual—when targeted by a cyberattack, most American corporations turn to private cybersecurity firms, and are hesitant to work with the US government due to concerns over what federal investigators might find in their computer systems.38 This hesitation to cooperate is based on a lack of trust, which is a natural consequence of competing interests. The private sector fears that the government will pursue its other interests, namely law enforcement, while casting aside corporate concerns over publicity or economic ramifications whenever such interests impede investigation.\n\nWhile progress on this front may already be underway, there is still much work to be done. In 2018, the US created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a subordinate agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Agency seeks to work across public and private sectors, challenging traditional ways of doing business by engaging with government, industry, academic, and international partners.39 This type of work should posture CISA to pursue the kind of “civilian military government (CMG) integration” needed to incentivize collaboration and cooperation between the public and private sectors. What is missing is transparency and clarity regarding the nature of CISA's relationship with the Intelligence Community (IC), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nTo partially mitigate the concerns of the private sector, the US government must pass legislation prohibiting CISA from collecting or storing privately owned data found during its cybersecurity response, operations, or forensics investigation activities, while also requiring corporate anonymization in threat reporting to protect corporate interests. Legislation must also clarify that CISA has no investigatory authorities with respect to domestic laws and prohibit any cooperation or communication with the FBI that does not directly advance collective national cybersecurity. Such measures would improve the private sector's perception of this new organization by demonstrating that CISA is capable of, and committed to, pursuing cybersecurity separate from other government functions, helping to establish trust and encourage national collaboration and cooperation unfettered by competing interests.\n\nAchieving CMG integration would significantly improve two additional challenges that the nation faces in the pursuit of national cybersecurity: a lack of shared understanding of cyber threats and poor unity of effort toward the common interests of cybersecurity. Currently, if thought of as a collective entity, the national “cyber talent pool” is highly fractured and disconnected. Large telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Comcast have very talented infrastructure managers. Silicon Valley attracts software engineering experts. Norton and FireEye target cyber forensics and reverse engineering specialists. There is a large community",

The National Security Agency offers its civil servants the opportunity to specialize in cryptography, code breaking, or intelligence work, and those drawn to the uniform can pursue each of these specialties, and more, by service in one of the uniformed services, and through them the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). However, the tremendous economic incentives of the US private sector make it difficult, if not entirely unrealistic, for the government to recruit and retain the nation's top cyberspace talent. CMG integration may offer an opportunity to partially address this challenge.\n\nFor well over a decade, there has been an ongoing debate in the US regarding the ethical and security ramifications of allowing the victims of cyberattacks to \"hack-back.\" The idea is poorly received by many, often citing concerns over escalation to war. However, it is nothing short of injustice for the government to acknowledge that it does not have the authorities or capacity to defend private commercial interests, while also constraining the response options of commercial victims of cyberattacks.[40] The fundamental implication of the \"defend forward\" element of the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy is that defending US government networks, critical infrastructure, and key resources requires a willingness and ability to regularly operate beyond US networks in order to disrupt, degrade, or deny adversary offensive capabilities before they reach America's digital shores. It is a phenomenal policy that has clearly improved USCYBERCOM's ability to identify, neutralize, or exploit threats to US government networks. However, the strategy also exposes an injustice, as US law and policy preclude Silicon Valley from taking similar measures, when necessary, to defend its own networks or commercial interests. China does not observe the US delineation between private or public, only national interests. While the US government's position is that the private sector should invest appropriately to defend its networks, defense is clearly not enough.\n\nSetting aside abstract principled objections, or even existing US or international law, the reality is that restricting the private sector's immense cyber talent from taking the necessary actions to defend US economic interests in cyberspace undermines both collective cybersecurity and deterrence. To marginalize the technical talent of the private sector operationally is akin to a football team that keeps its star players on the bench. If the US thought of cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition, and not merely a domain of military or government conflict, it would not hesitate to fully leverage the best talent available to win the game. Since such a fundamental change to how the US thinks and operates in cyberspace seems unlikely in the near term, improving CMG integration might offer a meaningful compromise.\n\nOnce CISA establishes a collaborative cybersecurity community that improves the national sight picture of cyber threats, it could assume an additional role by giving the private sector a central point of contact for requesting offensive action in response to foreign cyber aggression against its corporate or economic interests. CISA would then coordinate with the appropriate agency to seek approval of the operation, affording the aggrieved company the opportunity\n\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Imagine, for a moment, Silicon Valley engineers collaborating with the offensive teams of USCYBERCOM to execute timely action in response to China's cyber aggression. This future operation would have better access to both threat intelligence and cyber talent than the current siloed model, with improved capability and credibility—and trust—setting a more solid foundation for deterrence.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nChina is very effectively using cyberspace to marginalize whatever relative power advantage the US might possess, and this has Beijing on a strategic azimuth to surpass Washington in terms of relative power. Despite possessing more capacity and capability than any nation in the world, the US has been unable to leverage its national abilities to deter undesirable Chinese behavior in cyberspace.^[41]^ This inability to achieve consensus reflects the fact that the US attempts to understand cyberspace largely through analogical reasoning, seeking conceptual understanding through the lens of existing phenomena like war or domestic and international law. This is a fundamentally flawed and limited approach that will continue to contribute to constrained thinking and national policy. Thucydides never would have imagined a world where the strong suffer what they must, while the weak do what they can. By broadening its view of cyberspace, resolving the constraints of its own theories, policies and thinking, and improving private and public sector cooperation, the US can build a better foundation from which to take the type of consistent and credible action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.^[42]^\n\n# DISCLAIMER\n\nThe views expressed in this work are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of the United States Military Academy, the Department of the Army, or the Department of Defense.\n\nSPRING 2023 | 133\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Despite the clear threat, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of cyberspace, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and conceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over other competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.\nWhen Thucydides wrote of envisioned dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, in 400 B.C, one cannot help but wonder whether he knew his words would influence thinking on power and conflict for centuries. A single quote from this Athenian general can be claimed the very progenitor of international relations theory: \"The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\"¹ This anarchic nature of the international political system creates an inherent danger and drives states to concern themselves primarily with power and security.² While the realities of the 21st century have not changed this natural tension between states, they have changed the tactics and strategies states employ. Between great powers, nuclear weapons offer no realistic positive political objective, and the utility of traditional military force has been reduced due to the perceived risk of escalation\nThis is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

Cyberspace has catalyzed and accelerated this type of competition. China has adapted to this reality faster than the United States (US), stealing trillions of dollars in intellectual property (IP) from America's commercial industries and research and development (R&amp;D) from its defense industrial base.⁴ Despite this demonstrated and significant threat to its relative power, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of the cyberspace domain, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and ceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter Chinese aggression in cyberspace.\n## THE CHINA THREAT\nBefore discussing the nuances of deterrence, cyberspace, or deterrence in cyberspace, it is prudent to clearly articulate the behavior to be deterred. Certainly, any deterrence strategy should account for the unique motives, costs, and risks of specific undesirable adversary behavior. For example, Russian state-led efforts to destabilize US institutions and manipulate the electorate involve benefits, costs, and risks that are distinct in scope, scale, and influence when compared to a non-state actor's relatively simplistic employment of ransomware to obtain economic resources. To influence an adversary's decision calculus and deter undesirable behavior, deterrence strategies should be deliberately catered to these unique considerations. The question is, then: Of the myriad ways China uses cyberspace in the pursuit of its national interests, what specific behavior should the US seek to deter?\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChina's laws, policies, and actions indicate three overarching priorities in cyberspace: domestic control and regime stability, espionage, and access to technology.⁵ The worldwide expansion of the Internet toward the end of the 20ᵗʰ century was largely shaped by the West. The thinking amongst the technological elite was that expanded connectivity, access to information, and unrestricted digital speech would have a liberalizing influence on the world, tempering and marginalizing authoritarian rule. Unfortunately, China quickly recognized the Internet's potential for unregulated free speech and uncontrolled proliferation of information, which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as existential threats to party security, control, and legitimacy.⁶ In response, by implementing measures such as the \"Great Firewall,\" as well as state-leveraged intermediary liability and a state-controlled information technology industry, the CCP has managed to turn the Internet into a massive tool of domestic surveillance and censorship.⁷ While this state behavior is at odds with the values of American democratic society, it should not be the primary focus of deterrence.\nChina's second priority in cyberspace, espionage, is complicated by matters of moral authority and legitimacy. The US, having significantly shaped and influenced the current rules-based international order, is committed to the norms and laws of the system and seeks to maintain international support through action that is consistent with its principles. James Clapper, then Director of National Intelligence, stated in 2015 that in cyberspace \"there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack.\"⁸ This recognition that the US conducts cyber espionage tacitly acknowledges the legitimacy of espionage in cyberspace. It also tangentially supports both the idea that espionage is a sovereign right and the belief that espionage has a fundamentally stabilizing influence in the international system, as improved awareness of adversary capabilities can temper expectations of benefit from the use of force. While the US should expect states to continue cyber espionage, a policy of deterrence would be manifest hypocrisy.\nWe then consider China's third priority in cyberspace—access to technology. China has demonstrated an extensive willingness and ability to exploit and access public and private networks worldwide in the pursuit of information and IP, particularly defense-related or technologically innovative R&amp;D.⁹ China's IP theft should not be dismissed as merely a private sector or economic concern. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center emphasizes this in its 2018 annual report, depicting foreign economic and industrial espionage as a significant threat to US prosperity, security, and competitive advantage.¹⁰ China's ability to reap the benefit of massive American investments in military and commercial R&amp;D diffuses US relative power within the international system. It also allows China to negate one of the most consequential competitive advantages of America's democratic, capitalist system over China's authoritarian, state-planned economy—the innovative forces of economic incentive in an open-market system.¹¹\nSPRING 2023 | 121\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe US has been slow to realize, and slower still to respond to, the gravity of the threat posed by China's theft of IP. The speed and operational tradecraft, as well as the breadth and diversity of targets involved, strain Washington's ability to appreciate the scope and scale of the collective impact to US national interests. For the sake of comparison, the military is quite proficient at contextualizing the direct, tangible threat that adversary military forces pose to national security. Weapon system ranges, hypersonic weapon speeds, operational reach, and force projection are all relatively easily understood and measured concepts that translate well to traditional conceptualizations of threats to national security. What is more difficult to measure, and thereby contextualize in degree and severity of vulnerability and effect, is the cumulative impact of comparatively abstract grey zone threats and attacks that target the intersection of security and other national interests.\nFor example, Russian social media disinformation and misinformation efforts target a state's national psyche, polarizing the electorate and undermining a democratic state's ability to achieve political and social consensus by exploiting the seams among freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and national security. Chinese IP theft exploits a different vulnerability: the seams among national security, commercial enterprise, and economic prosperity. When adversaries target these seams, they create not only uncertainty about the extent of what is happening but also an inability or unwillingness to coordinate and execute the type of assertive, credible, associative, and timely national response needed to achieve deterrence. Yet, purely with respect to economic prosperity and relative power, the collective costs of cyberattacks may very well compete with or outweigh the net costs of any war in US history.\n# CYBERSPACE: UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON\nTo improve the conceptual foundations needed to deliver policies and strategies that could realistically create the conditions needed for deterrence, the US must first expand how it views the phenomenon of cyberspace. Throughout much of the 21st century, the government and military communities debated the question of whether or not cyberspace is a domain of warfare, equal in status and warfighting significance to the maritime, land, air, and space domains.[12] This particular question appears to be at least partially resolved, with the military's position apparent in its definition of \"cyberspace\" in Joint Publication 3-12: \"the domain [emphasis added] within the information environment that consists of the interdependent network of information technology (IT) infrastructures and resident data.\"[13]\nA myopic focus on the military aspects of cyberspace is insufficient for the US to pursue and defend its national interests. While cyberspace certainly creates opportunities and vulnerabilities during war, it also offers US enemies a low-cost opportunity to pursue their strategic interests during peace, entirely negating the coercive and deterrent influences of US economic and military might. This ability of a state or an individual actor to pursue their interests through cyberspace, unthreatened and unimpeded by any relative power asymmetries that\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nexist, suggests that the environment should not be thought of as the \"fourth military offset,\" but as an international relations offset.¹⁴ The figure below depicts cyberspace not merely as a military domain, but a broad spectrum, while also highlighting the relatively small portion of cyberspace where the military primarily operates.\n|  Competition |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | Conflict  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Social Functions |   | Economic Functions |   |   | Government Functions  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Medical | Academia | Media | Commercial | Industrial | Law Enforcement | Homeland Security | Foreign | Military |   |\nFigure 1: Cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition and conflict.\nCyberspace is not a domain where national business is conducted, and national interests are pursued in isolated silos. Instead, the US must view cyberspace as a broad and interconnected spectrum that supports and enables the sources and instruments of national power across the entire continuum of competition to conflict on a geopolitical—not just a military—battlefield.\nYet, the continued evolution of war, and therefore the military instrument of national power, has resulted in a US military that performs functions and duties that go well beyond traditional armed conflict. From nation-building, including the construction of schools and hospitals or training of judges and politicians in Afghanistan, to humanitarian assistance, disaster recovery, and agricultural development in Africa, the military is no longer a simple hammer, but has become a geopolitical multi-purpose tool.¹⁵ However, while the modern US military is capable of far more than applying conventional force in the pursuit of political objectives, this does not change the fact that it is still built primarily for war. This belligerent purpose not only influences military culture, recruitment efforts, virtues, and norms, but drives how the military trains and disciplines itself, educates its leaders, and is entirely deterministic in how it identifies, prioritizes, develops, and acquires its capabilities. War is not merely what the military plans for but shapes the very process that the military uses to plan.\nWithin game theory, a finite game is one in which either the rules of the game or the incentives of the players serve to ensure that the game ends with clear winners and losers. Since nations in an armed conflict seek or are generally incentivized to end the conflict, a declared period of war is a finite game. Geopolitical competition between the US and China, however, is an infinite game, since it is reasonable to assert that neither party is sufficiently incentivized realistically to seek a permanent and definitive culmination of the competition.¹⁶ Instead, both parties seek to establish and exploit their own competitive advantages while avoiding or negating their opponent's comparative strengths. Understanding the temporal character of both competition and conflict should inform, if not determine, the dominant strategies of the game, influencing how players think about time, resources, maneuver, and objectives. The macro trends of twenty-first century competition and conflict thus far indicate that while the nature of cyberspace provides actors with ample opportunity for influence, espionage, exploitation, and subversion, the environment is significantly less conducive to coercion than other domains.\nSPRING 2023 | 123\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nAn important implication here may be that cyberspace is better suited for the pursuit of broad objectives in an infinite game, as opposed to the narrowly defined and time-constrained objectives of a finite game.\nFor instance, Moscow's failure to meaningfully disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate its national defense through employment of cyber capabilities prior to or during Russia's invasion supports the idea that cyberspace is better postured for broad geopolitical competition objectives than discrete, narrowly tailored war objectives. Despite a decade of politicians, military leaders, academics, and pundits alike predicting a future conflict largely decided by cyber means, it does not appear that Russia mounted a consequential cyber offensive as part of its invasion. This has caused some to doubt the current or future strategic utility of cyberspace.[17] However, prudence demands caution before making definitive statements or attempting conclusions regarding Russia's failure, as both time and declassification are equally likely to disprove many seemingly factual observations. If Russia has employed cyberspace capabilities as part of its invasion of Ukraine, very few observers have the means to observe and assess their impact sufficiently, or understand the degree that commercial, state, or non-state entities aided in the defense of Ukrainian cyberspace.\nWhether Russia failed to develop, integrate, and deliver strategically consequential cyber effects, or the Microsoft, Anonymous, and NATO-supported community-based cyberspace defense efforts succeeded in neutralizing those effects, both potentialities provide logical support to the argument that cyberspace is better suited to geopolitical conflict than war. Russia has demonstrated the ability, when unconstrained by time and comparatively broad in its desired targets or effects, to shut down national electric grids as part of a broader geopolitical effort to destabilize its opponents or competitors.[18] In contrast, it appears that Russia has learned that during war—or a finite game—it needed to count on the effectiveness of specific capabilities and effects against a narrowly defined set of targets on a specific timeline. While military capabilities like tanks, bombers and aircraft carriers offer military planners the ability to predict or make realistic assumptions about the types of effects the military can deliver on a particular timeline, capabilities and vulnerabilities in cyberspace are often ephemeral, offering much less predictability or reliability over time.\nBy comparison, objectives during geopolitical competition are not as often constrained by time, do not always include narrowly defined targets, or demand discrete or tailored effects. Russia's ability to influence the 2016 US election was not only the result of years of effort, but the nature of the political objective meant that Russian actors in cyberspace had nearly unlimited targets and potential effects they could reasonably claim to be influencing the election. Additionally, as is often the case with well-conceived information operations, the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which Russia compromised the election created additional division and distrust within the electorate. Russia also had the benefit of rehearsals for its techniques, having targeted several elections in Belarus, Ukraine, and, of course, its own internal elections since 2007.[19]\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChinese IP theft via cyberspace is similarly a matter of geopolitical competition in which China, seeking to out-compete the US over time, pursues broad objectives against a diverse set of targets and effects. Washington should carefully reconsider the wisdom of leaning too heavily on its finite-game player (the military) to counter China's infinite-game strategy, while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of whether the US seeks to win, or out-compete, before establishing policies or strategies that direct how it uses national resources to play the game.\nRegardless, if deterrence—or the ability to dissuade Beijing from certain behavior because the perceived benefits do not justify the perceived costs and risks—is the objective of US policy regarding Chinese IP theft, this will require the ability to influence CCP perceptions and intention.²⁰ Targeting and influencing perception requires both capability and credibility. However, before discussing strategies for using capability and credibility to influence perception and intention, it must be understood that existing deterrence theory was developed largely to deter aggression.²¹\nWithin the context of international relations, as well as deterrence theory, aggression is most often a matter of the coercive threat or use of force between states. Yet, it is exceedingly counterproductive to limit the conversation of cyberattacks to this narrow context, not only because most attacks in cyberspace offer poor analogical parallel to the concept of force in the physical world, but also because force is not defined in the United Nations (UN) Charter. To date neither the US nor China—despite overwhelming evidence of cyberattacks that undermine their national interests and threaten the security of their critical infrastructure—has invoked the protection of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibiting the use of force. That neither state has claimed this protection supports the assertion that most cyberattacks should not be considered within the context of military force employment.\n## NO LAWS OF UNARMED CONFLICT: REVISITING OUR THEORIES, LAWS, AND CONCEPTS\nWithout international consensus characterizing the preponderance of state behavior in cyberspace as \"force,\" logic should then demand skepticism among cyber policymakers regarding the wholesale applicability, and advisability of deference to, existing theories, laws, and norms surrounding the conventional use of force to competition or conflict in cyberspace. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), for instance, is a body of international law intended to limit humanitarian impacts caused during the use of force between states. If there is no existing law or normative international agreement characterizing state cyberattacks against other states as force, what is the virtue or value of allowing restraining concepts like proportionality, distinction, or military necessity to interfere with the defense—or pursuit, for that matter—of national interests in cyberspace? Why would the US elect to conduct the cognitive gymnastics necessary to frame cyberattacks within the context of LOAC? To avoid the ire of operational law attorneys, this article will sidestep the nuances and technicalities of the legal debate by\nSPRING 2023 | 125\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nsimply asserting that LOAC is an analogically poor framework for regulating state behavior in cyberspace. While there remains insufficient international consensus to establish the type of norms needed to constrain state behavior, insistence upon applying the constraints of LOAC is diffusing US relative power and restraining US ability to deter aggression in cyberspace.\nExtant deterrence theory and policies should be viewed with similar skepticism. Classical deterrence theory, devised to disincentivize the aggressive use of force between states, may prove insufficient in deterring the unique forms of aggressive state behavior seen in cyberspace. In their book *Cross-Domain Deterrence*, Jon R. Lindsey and Erik Gartzke note that classic deterrence theory is itself a historical product of a particular technological innovation—nuclear weapons—and cast doubt on the theory's application to the emergence of new technologies.[22]\nThe unique nature of cyberspace, and the fledgling historical record of competition and conflict therein, also gives reason to question strategic assumptions regarding the propensity for escalation, both within cyberspace as well as the cross-domain variety. In *The Perfect Weapon*, David Sanger notes that one reason the US cannot figure out how to counter cyberattacks is its belief that response incurs a great risk of escalation.[23] However, hesitation by the US to respond to attacks in cyberspace over concerns of escalation is poorly founded, based more on sentiment and abstraction than historical or empirical evidence. To the contrary, two decades of state competition and conflict in cyberspace suggest that a rational actor in the current international system will not use traditional military force as a response to cyberattacks that deliver only economic or information effects. To attribute the observed lack of proliferation in kinetic effects delivered through cyberspace to some inherently deterrent influence of cyberpower itself is logically lacking, as the cyber domain in that situation becomes merely a medium for cross-domain kinetic effect.\nIt is also logically consistent that the effects of conventional deterrence would have cross-domain influence, deterring escalation from cyber effect to kinetic action both internally and externally to the cyber domain. It stands to reason that any cyberattack that delivers armed attack equivalent effects will be treated by a state no differently than conventional force employment. In such a case, the medium of delivery is logically relevant, but should be inconsequential, as there would be little rational reason for a state to treat such an attack any differently than the use of land, maritime, or air power to deliver conventional force.\nIt can also be counterproductive to constrain thinking on national cybersecurity to extant military theory or doctrine. For instance, the wisdom of Clausewitz contributes to the theoretical foundations of belligerency the assertion that between two parties with equal means, defense is not only easier than attack but is the stronger and more superior form of fighting.[24] Here it should be noted that Clausewitz differentiates between \"pure defense,\" or the act of waiting for a blow that permanently leaves the initiative with the enemy, and \"relative defense,\" which encompasses both defensive and offensive maneuver for the purpose of either attriting the enemy or deliberately manipulating time and/or space in order to negate an enemy's temporal\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nadvantage or influence the enemy's decision calculus.²⁵ Clausewitz casts pure defense aside as contrary to the very idea of war. In cyberspace pure defense—static defense measures such as firewalls, antivirus scanners, personal security products, and other automated security tools employed and monitored by system administrators and network defenders—certainly has an important place in geopolitical competition, conflict, and war.\nClausewitz’s characterization of the asymmetries of interest and the nature of interplay between the offense and defense, as well as other supporting arguments for the general superiority of the defense, also apply inconsistently to conflict in cyberspace. The unique aspects of cyberspace, including the inherent obfuscation of identity, the relative ease of concealing digital presence and activities, the lack of geographic buffers, and the compression of both time and distance, combine to provide distinct advantages to the attacker over the defender.²⁶ In an infinite game, the advantages of maneuver, objective, initiative, economy of force, unity of command, simplicity, speed, and surprise all belong to the offense.\nWhile the debate over the comparative advantages of offense or defense in cyberspace is unlikely to culminate in foreseeable future, the 21st century experience suggests that while the best defense in cyberspace might require some offensive action, deterrence in cyberspace will undoubtedly require both. Deterrence by denial—or lowering an adversary’s expectation of success—is supported through improved cybersecurity and defensive measures intended to frustrate, mitigate, or prevent cyberattacks. Yet, there are dual asymmetries to resolve in deterring IP theft through cyberspace. First, the fundamental and inherent asymmetry between the significant potential benefits and comparatively low costs and barriers to entry makes it difficult to deter IP theft exclusively through defense. This, combined with an asymmetry of vulnerability created by US commitment to open societies, capitalist market-based economies, and global interdependency, makes it unlikely that defense alone can achieve deterrence.\nThe fact that China’s IP theft occurs within an infinite game only compounds this reality. In an infinite game, the low cost of offense and significant financial and manpower costs of defense make it is unrealistic to expect defense alone to reduce state perceptions of benefit sufficiently to a level that achieves deterrence over time. While the continued maturation of security-focused network architectures such as zero-trust, as well as increased integration of automation or even artificial intelligence, may with time improve the effectiveness of defense and cybersecurity, there is little reason to doubt that offensive techniques and attack capabilities will be similarly improved in the time needed to implement these defensive measures. Yet, when reduced perception or likelihood of benefit is combined with increased perception of costs and risks, achieved through consistent and credible punishment, deterrence might be possible.\nOn top of the need to critically evaluate the applicability of existing theory, laws, and norms to cyberspace, it is prudent to reflect on US cyber policy, as the credibility of US national response to Chinese IP theft has been constrained by a variety of policy and bureaucratic\nSPRING 2023 | 127\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nlimitations across presidential administrations.27 One such constraining influence is America's strategic culture, which is the idea that deeply rooted cultural preferences exert influence on strategic choices, and that a nation's security history imposes a certain inertia on the decisions of the state in a way that can make strategy less responsive to modern evolutions in the character of competition and conflict.28 In cyberspace, an artifact of the multi-decade Cold War is that the US maintains a significant strategic preference for intelligence over effects. Since 2011, options for decisive offensive cyber operations in response to cyberattacks have been presented regularly to national leadership. A common objection to offensive operations, often coming from the U.S. Intelligence Community, is that offensive action poses risk to intelligence collection capabilities while delivering only a limited or short-lived benefit.29 However, consistent deference to this view has destroyed Washington's ability to establish the credibility needed to deter cyber aggression. The predictability of the US strategic preference for economic stability, diplomatic influence, and intelligence collection over deterrence in cyberspace inexorably undermines its own credibility.\nWhile strategic culture is certainly an obstacle, the challenge of attribution also constrains US thinking and consistency of action in cyberspace.30 Cyber attribution, the process of identifying and laying blame on the actor of a cyberattack, is strained by many unique aspects of cyberspace itself. The logical rules that govern how networked devices communicate serve to obfuscate identity in a way that is understandably confusing to a lawyer or a politician, but much less so to a trained cyber professional. The challenge of convincing non-technical policy and decision-makers of the significance and accuracy of cyber forensics evidence has certainly contributed to a decade of failure deterring aggression in cyberspace. The US must mature not only its understanding of attribution, but its willingness to act in situations of attributional uncertainty, if the nation is to achieve the consistency of action needed for deterrence.\nThere are five “elements” of attributing action in cyberspace, including persona, geopolitical, geographic, logical, and physical layers. Each element can be independently and definitively determined through advanced cyber forensics. An in-depth articulation of the nuances of each element is not needed to understand the greater point: the US should reject the thinking that all five elements of attribution must be satisfied to justify action in response to cyberattacks. Currently, US decision-makers are holding attribution for actions in cyberspace to an unnecessarily high standard when each singular element of attribution offers a unique objective justification for a wide variety of potential national response actions. In other domains, decisions regarding US military action are often made based on comprehensive, multi-factor intelligence assessments. The same type of assessment is possible in cyberspace.\n## ADDRESSING THE CONSTRAINTS OF ATTRIBUTION\nA multi-factor cyberspace attribution assessment would combine cyber forensics evidence with an analysis of the historical records of cyberattacks, economic and geopolitical\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nmotivations, as well as signals and human intelligence, to enable analysts to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive, contextually informed confidence assessment. This framework would deliberately allow for some subjectivity, including an assessment of whether a cyberattack is consistent with enemy state interests, previously attributed cyberattacks, or known state cyber capabilities and signatures. Combining objective forensics evidence with subjective intelligence analysis should serve to improve the comfort level of decision-makers in approving and directing timely and decisive action in response to cyberattacks.\nThe US cyber response playbook should include the widest possible variety of punitive and responsive legal, diplomatic, informational, economic, and military actions. Such actions should include international or domestic indictment, as well as the colloquial \"name and shame\" brand of embarrassing public statements and condemnation. In 2015, President Obama demonstrated that the evidence of cyberattacks can be used quite effectively as leverage during diplomatic or trade negotiations.[31] The US should also expand its use of economic punishment measures to target the material interests of not only national governments, but also private commercial entities that enable enemy cyberattacks. In addition, of course, the US can use overt, covert, or clandestine offensive cyberspace operations for a wide variety of deliberate effects. Each of these potential responses receives a unique degree of logical support from the individual elements of attribution.\nFor example, consider a cyberattack in which the US can definitively identify the physical devices used during an attack, as well as the geographic location—in, such as China—of the equipment during the attack. Without the ability to attribute the persona element or geopolitical association (individual hacktivist versus government-sanctioned operative) of the attacker, it is perfectly reasonable to take certain playbook options, like indictment, off the table. However, given the location of the attack origin, this partial attribution offers at least some value as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, while actions targeting the device(s) or the material interests of any identified enablers would also be justified. For the sake of contrast, in the less common scenario in which the identity and geopolitical association of an attacker can be attributed, the entire playbook should be viewed as available, with or without definitive attribution of the physical or logical layers of the equipment used during the attack.\nYet, obfuscation of identity is only one way that the challenge of attribution strains a state's ability to deter aggression in cyberspace. Not only is it possible for a skilled cyber actor to obfuscate or destroy digital evidence of their presence and actions, but attributional efforts are further frustrated by the pace of technological change, the inherent and real-time customizability of cyberspace capabilities, and the omnipresent need for secrecy to protect both capabilities and a state's awareness of adversary vulnerabilities. The consequence here is that attributing action in cyberspace will, for the foreseeable future, undermine the type of timely, transactional, and associative punitive response needed to sufficiently signal to adversaries a correlation between cause and effect.\nSPRING 2023 | 129\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThis inescapable delay between cyberattack and punishment poses a serious problem within the cognitive confines of classical deterrence theory, as a state that intends to signal or deliver punishment for undesirable behavior needs to do so in a timely and associative manner. With the nature of cyberspace naturally complicating timely response, perhaps deterrence in cyberspace demands that states evolve thinking beyond transactional tit-for-tat responses to seemingly isolated incidents of cyberattacks, and instead respond comprehensively to the collective and cumulative impacts of an adversary's actions to the state's national interests.\nLucas Kello, the director of the Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, expands upon this idea in his 2021 article in the Journal of Cybersecurity: \"Cyber Legalism: why it fails and what to do about it.\" In the article, Kello articulates four principles that should inform better doctrine for cyber conflict. His first principle, the \"accretional principle,\" suggests that states should treat attacks as strategic campaigns, not individual actions.[32] If cyberattacks were punished cumulatively, it would allow a state to target the psychological component of adversarial decision making without the constraints of time, possibly even reducing the burden of attribution through aggregation. Similar to the Clausewitzian notion of relative defense, a strategy that observes the accretional principle would allow the victim of cyberattacks to maintain initiative by delivering penalties in a concentrated fashion and controlling key conditions of the interaction—namely time and location. This effectively enables the defender to determine, and when desirable obfuscate, the threshold of aggregate harm that triggers punishment. The \"many possible permutations of punishable actions and their attendant penalties give the defender a wide scope of maneuver,\" introducing the type of uncertainty that should complicate an adversary's risk-benefit analysis. Well-executed, the ability to deliberately create uncertainty could reasonably cause an adversary to guess conservatively about the location of the line of response, delivering a deterrent effect on the utilization of cyberattack.[33]\n# OBSTACLES AND IMPEDIMENTS: COMPETING INTERESTS AND POOR NATIONAL UNITY OF EFFORT\nIf deterrence demands both capability and credibility, then why has deterrence failed in cyberspace? While the US is the \"world's stealthiest, most skilled cyber power,\"[34] since 2006, it has also been the target of more significant cyberattacks than the next seven countries combined.[35] Despite possessing tremendous cyber capabilities and capacity—military and commercial alike—the US is not feared in cyberspace.[36] While this observation demands a theory-based articulation of whether the nature of cyberspace complicates or precludes coercion, such an endeavor is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, it is enough to simply observe that while China is undoubtedly aware of US cyber capabilities, it is increasingly convinced of Washington's lack of resolve to use those capabilities to punish its behavior.[37] However, even if the US can broaden its view of cyberspace, resolve the limitations of its strategic culture, expand its view of attribution, and deliver a strategy that increases its willingness to act, certain obstacles and impediments still weaken the foundations of US deterrent potential in cyberspace.\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nOne such impediment is the lack of trust, communication, collaboration, and cooperation between the government and the private sector. When Google executives were notified in 2009 that the Chinese had compromised their systems, they waited nearly a year to acknowledge the attack publicly. Moreover, Google did not reveal the full extent of the exposure; a server used to store court orders from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had also been compromised. Google's response was not unusual—when targeted by a cyberattack, most American corporations turn to private cybersecurity firms, and are hesitant to work with the US government due to concerns over what federal investigators might find in their computer systems.38 This hesitation to cooperate is based on a lack of trust, which is a natural consequence of competing interests. The private sector fears that the government will pursue its other interests, namely law enforcement, while casting aside corporate concerns over publicity or economic ramifications whenever such interests impede investigation.\nWhile progress on this front may already be underway, there is still much work to be done. In 2018, the US created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a subordinate agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Agency seeks to work across public and private sectors, challenging traditional ways of doing business by engaging with government, industry, academic, and international partners.39 This type of work should posture CISA to pursue the kind of “civilian military government (CMG) integration” needed to incentivize collaboration and cooperation between the public and private sectors. What is missing is transparency and clarity regarding the nature of CISA's relationship with the Intelligence Community (IC), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\nTo partially mitigate the concerns of the private sector, the US government must pass legislation prohibiting CISA from collecting or storing privately owned data found during its cybersecurity response, operations, or forensics investigation activities, while also requiring corporate anonymization in threat reporting to protect corporate interests. Legislation must also clarify that CISA has no investigatory authorities with respect to domestic laws and prohibit any cooperation or communication with the FBI that does not directly advance collective national cybersecurity. Such measures would improve the private sector's perception of this new organization by demonstrating that CISA is capable of, and committed to, pursuing cybersecurity separate from other government functions, helping to establish trust and encourage national collaboration and cooperation unfettered by competing interests.\nAchieving CMG integration would significantly improve two additional challenges that the nation faces in the pursuit of national cybersecurity: a lack of shared understanding of cyber threats and poor unity of effort toward the common interests of cybersecurity. Currently, if thought of as a collective entity, the national “cyber talent pool” is highly fractured and disconnected. Large telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Comcast have very talented infrastructure managers. Silicon Valley attracts software engineering experts. Norton and FireEye target cyber forensics and reverse engineering specialists. There is a large community\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nof independent penetration testers and certified ethical hackers throughout the country. The National Security Agency offers its civil servants the opportunity to specialize in cryptography, code breaking, or intelligence work, and those drawn to the uniform can pursue each of these specialties, and more, by service in one of the uniformed services, and through them the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). However, the tremendous economic incentives of the US private sector make it difficult, if not entirely unrealistic, for the government to recruit and retain the nation's top cyberspace talent. CMG integration may offer an opportunity to partially address this challenge.\nFor well over a decade, there has been an ongoing debate in the US regarding the ethical and security ramifications of allowing the victims of cyberattacks to \"hack-back.\" The idea is poorly received by many, often citing concerns over escalation to war. However, it is nothing short of injustice for the government to acknowledge that it does not have the authorities or capacity to defend private commercial interests, while also constraining the response options of commercial victims of cyberattacks.[40] The fundamental implication of the \"defend forward\" element of the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy is that defending US government networks, critical infrastructure, and key resources requires a willingness and ability to regularly operate beyond US networks in order to disrupt, degrade, or deny adversary offensive capabilities before they reach America's digital shores. It is a phenomenal policy that has clearly improved USCYBERCOM's ability to identify, neutralize, or exploit threats to US government networks. However, the strategy also exposes an injustice, as US law and policy preclude Silicon Valley from taking similar measures, when necessary, to defend its own networks or commercial interests. China does not observe the US delineation between private or public, only national interests. While the US government's position is that the private sector should invest appropriately to defend its networks, defense is clearly not enough.\nSetting aside abstract principled objections, or even existing US or international law, the reality is that restricting the private sector's immense cyber talent from taking the necessary actions to defend US economic interests in cyberspace undermines both collective cybersecurity and deterrence. To marginalize the technical talent of the private sector operationally is akin to a football team that keeps its star players on the bench. If the US thought of cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition, and not merely a domain of military or government conflict, it would not hesitate to fully leverage the best talent available to win the game. Since such a fundamental change to how the US thinks and operates in cyberspace seems unlikely in the near term, improving CMG integration might offer a meaningful compromise.\nOnce CISA establishes a collaborative cybersecurity community that improves the national sight picture of cyber threats, it could assume an additional role by giving the private sector a central point of contact for requesting offensive action in response to foreign cyber aggression against its corporate or economic interests. CISA would then coordinate with the appropriate agency to seek approval of the operation, affording the aggrieved company the opportunity\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nto provide relevant information, and possibly even offer materiel or technical support, toward achieving responsive remedial—and ideally deterrent—action. Imagine, for a moment, Silicon Valley engineers collaborating with the offensive teams of USCYBERCOM to execute timely action in response to China's cyber aggression. This future operation would have better access to both threat intelligence and cyber talent than the current siloed model, with improved capability and credibility—and trust—setting a more solid foundation for deterrence.\n# CONCLUSION\nChina is very effectively using cyberspace to marginalize whatever relative power advantage the US might possess, and this has Beijing on a strategic azimuth to surpass Washington in terms of relative power. Despite possessing more capacity and capability than any nation in the world, the US has been unable to leverage its national abilities to deter undesirable Chinese behavior in cyberspace.^[41]^ This inability to achieve consensus reflects the fact that the US attempts to understand cyberspace largely through analogical reasoning, seeking conceptual understanding through the lens of existing phenomena like war or domestic and international law. This is a fundamentally flawed and limited approach that will continue to contribute to constrained thinking and national policy. Thucydides never would have imagined a world where the strong suffer what they must, while the weak do what they can. By broadening its view of cyberspace, resolving the constraints of its own theories, policies and thinking, and improving private and public sector cooperation, the US can build a better foundation from which to take the type of consistent and credible action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.^[42]^\n# DISCLAIMER\nThe views expressed in this work are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of the United States Military Academy, the Department of the Army, or the Department of Defense.\nSPRING 2023 | 133\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE",

Despite the clear threat, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of cyberspace, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and conceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over other competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.\nWhen Thucydides wrote of envisioned dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, in 400 B.C, one cannot help but wonder whether he knew his words would influence thinking on power and conflict for centuries. A single quote from this Athenian general can be claimed the very progenitor of international relations theory: \"The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\"¹ This anarchic nature of the international political system creates an inherent danger and drives states to concern themselves primarily with power and security.² While the realities of the 21st century have not changed this natural tension between states, they have changed the tactics and strategies states employ. Between great powers, nuclear weapons offer no realistic positive political objective, and the utility of traditional military force has been reduced due to the perceived risk of escalation\nThis is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

Cyberspace has catalyzed and accelerated this type of competition. China has adapted to this reality faster than the United States (US), stealing trillions of dollars in intellectual property (IP) from America's commercial industries and research and development (R&amp;D) from its defense industrial base.⁴ Despite this demonstrated and significant threat to its relative power, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of the cyberspace domain, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and ceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter Chinese aggression in cyberspace.\n## THE CHINA THREAT\nBefore discussing the nuances of deterrence, cyberspace, or deterrence in cyberspace, it is prudent to clearly articulate the behavior to be deterred. Certainly, any deterrence strategy should account for the unique motives, costs, and risks of specific undesirable adversary behavior. For example, Russian state-led efforts to destabilize US institutions and manipulate the electorate involve benefits, costs, and risks that are distinct in scope, scale, and influence when compared to a non-state actor's relatively simplistic employment of ransomware to obtain economic resources. To influence an adversary's decision calculus and deter undesirable behavior, deterrence strategies should be deliberately catered to these unique considerations. The question is, then: Of the myriad ways China uses cyberspace in the pursuit of its national interests, what specific behavior should the US seek to deter?\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChina's laws, policies, and actions indicate three overarching priorities in cyberspace: domestic control and regime stability, espionage, and access to technology.⁵ The worldwide expansion of the Internet toward the end of the 20ᵗʰ century was largely shaped by the West. The thinking amongst the technological elite was that expanded connectivity, access to information, and unrestricted digital speech would have a liberalizing influence on the world, tempering and marginalizing authoritarian rule. Unfortunately, China quickly recognized the Internet's potential for unregulated free speech and uncontrolled proliferation of information, which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as existential threats to party security, control, and legitimacy.⁶ In response, by implementing measures such as the \"Great Firewall,\" as well as state-leveraged intermediary liability and a state-controlled information technology industry, the CCP has managed to turn the Internet into a massive tool of domestic surveillance and censorship.⁷ While this state behavior is at odds with the values of American democratic society, it should not be the primary focus of deterrence.\nChina's second priority in cyberspace, espionage, is complicated by matters of moral authority and legitimacy. The US, having significantly shaped and influenced the current rules-based international order, is committed to the norms and laws of the system and seeks to maintain international support through action that is consistent with its principles. James Clapper, then Director of National Intelligence, stated in 2015 that in cyberspace \"there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack.\"⁸ This recognition that the US conducts cyber espionage tacitly acknowledges the legitimacy of espionage in cyberspace. It also tangentially supports both the idea that espionage is a sovereign right and the belief that espionage has a fundamentally stabilizing influence in the international system, as improved awareness of adversary capabilities can temper expectations of benefit from the use of force. While the US should expect states to continue cyber espionage, a policy of deterrence would be manifest hypocrisy.\nWe then consider China's third priority in cyberspace—access to technology. China has demonstrated an extensive willingness and ability to exploit and access public and private networks worldwide in the pursuit of information and IP, particularly defense-related or technologically innovative R&amp;D.⁹ China's IP theft should not be dismissed as merely a private sector or economic concern. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center emphasizes this in its 2018 annual report, depicting foreign economic and industrial espionage as a significant threat to US prosperity, security, and competitive advantage.¹⁰ China's ability to reap the benefit of massive American investments in military and commercial R&amp;D diffuses US relative power within the international system. It also allows China to negate one of the most consequential competitive advantages of America's democratic, capitalist system over China's authoritarian, state-planned economy—the innovative forces of economic incentive in an open-market system.¹¹\nSPRING 2023 | 121\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe US has been slow to realize, and slower still to respond to, the gravity of the threat posed by China's theft of IP. The speed and operational tradecraft, as well as the breadth and diversity of targets involved, strain Washington's ability to appreciate the scope and scale of the collective impact to US national interests. For the sake of comparison, the military is quite proficient at contextualizing the direct, tangible threat that adversary military forces pose to national security. Weapon system ranges, hypersonic weapon speeds, operational reach, and force projection are all relatively easily understood and measured concepts that translate well to traditional conceptualizations of threats to national security. What is more difficult to measure, and thereby contextualize in degree and severity of vulnerability and effect, is the cumulative impact of comparatively abstract grey zone threats and attacks that target the intersection of security and other national interests.\nFor example, Russian social media disinformation and misinformation efforts target a state's national psyche, polarizing the electorate and undermining a democratic state's ability to achieve political and social consensus by exploiting the seams among freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and national security. Chinese IP theft exploits a different vulnerability: the seams among national security, commercial enterprise, and economic prosperity. When adversaries target these seams, they create not only uncertainty about the extent of what is happening but also an inability or unwillingness to coordinate and execute the type of assertive, credible, associative, and timely national response needed to achieve deterrence. Yet, purely with respect to economic prosperity and relative power, the collective costs of cyberattacks may very well compete with or outweigh the net costs of any war in US history.\n# CYBERSPACE: UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON\nTo improve the conceptual foundations needed to deliver policies and strategies that could realistically create the conditions needed for deterrence, the US must first expand how it views the phenomenon of cyberspace. Throughout much of the 21st century, the government and military communities debated the question of whether or not cyberspace is a domain of warfare, equal in status and warfighting significance to the maritime, land, air, and space domains.[12] This particular question appears to be at least partially resolved, with the military's position apparent in its definition of \"cyberspace\" in Joint Publication 3-12: \"the domain [emphasis added] within the information environment that consists of the interdependent network of information technology (IT) infrastructures and resident data.\"[13]\nA myopic focus on the military aspects of cyberspace is insufficient for the US to pursue and defend its national interests. While cyberspace certainly creates opportunities and vulnerabilities during war, it also offers US enemies a low-cost opportunity to pursue their strategic interests during peace, entirely negating the coercive and deterrent influences of US economic and military might. This ability of a state or an individual actor to pursue their interests through cyberspace, unthreatened and unimpeded by any relative power asymmetries that\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nexist, suggests that the environment should not be thought of as the \"fourth military offset,\" but as an international relations offset.¹⁴ The figure below depicts cyberspace not merely as a military domain, but a broad spectrum, while also highlighting the relatively small portion of cyberspace where the military primarily operates.\n|  Competition |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | Conflict  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Social Functions |   | Economic Functions |   |   | Government Functions  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Medical | Academia | Media | Commercial | Industrial | Law Enforcement | Homeland Security | Foreign | Military |   |\nFigure 1: Cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition and conflict.\nCyberspace is not a domain where national business is conducted, and national interests are pursued in isolated silos. Instead, the US must view cyberspace as a broad and interconnected spectrum that supports and enables the sources and instruments of national power across the entire continuum of competition to conflict on a geopolitical—not just a military—battlefield.\nYet, the continued evolution of war, and therefore the military instrument of national power, has resulted in a US military that performs functions and duties that go well beyond traditional armed conflict. From nation-building, including the construction of schools and hospitals or training of judges and politicians in Afghanistan, to humanitarian assistance, disaster recovery, and agricultural development in Africa, the military is no longer a simple hammer, but has become a geopolitical multi-purpose tool.¹⁵ However, while the modern US military is capable of far more than applying conventional force in the pursuit of political objectives, this does not change the fact that it is still built primarily for war. This belligerent purpose not only influences military culture, recruitment efforts, virtues, and norms, but drives how the military trains and disciplines itself, educates its leaders, and is entirely deterministic in how it identifies, prioritizes, develops, and acquires its capabilities. War is not merely what the military plans for but shapes the very process that the military uses to plan.\nWithin game theory, a finite game is one in which either the rules of the game or the incentives of the players serve to ensure that the game ends with clear winners and losers. Since nations in an armed conflict seek or are generally incentivized to end the conflict, a declared period of war is a finite game. Geopolitical competition between the US and China, however, is an infinite game, since it is reasonable to assert that neither party is sufficiently incentivized realistically to seek a permanent and definitive culmination of the competition.¹⁶ Instead, both parties seek to establish and exploit their own competitive advantages while avoiding or negating their opponent's comparative strengths. Understanding the temporal character of both competition and conflict should inform, if not determine, the dominant strategies of the game, influencing how players think about time, resources, maneuver, and objectives. The macro trends of twenty-first century competition and conflict thus far indicate that while the nature of cyberspace provides actors with ample opportunity for influence, espionage, exploitation, and subversion, the environment is significantly less conducive to coercion than other domains.\nSPRING 2023 | 123\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nAn important implication here may be that cyberspace is better suited for the pursuit of broad objectives in an infinite game, as opposed to the narrowly defined and time-constrained objectives of a finite game.\nFor instance, Moscow's failure to meaningfully disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate its national defense through employment of cyber capabilities prior to or during Russia's invasion supports the idea that cyberspace is better postured for broad geopolitical competition objectives than discrete, narrowly tailored war objectives. Despite a decade of politicians, military leaders, academics, and pundits alike predicting a future conflict largely decided by cyber means, it does not appear that Russia mounted a consequential cyber offensive as part of its invasion. This has caused some to doubt the current or future strategic utility of cyberspace.[17] However, prudence demands caution before making definitive statements or attempting conclusions regarding Russia's failure, as both time and declassification are equally likely to disprove many seemingly factual observations. If Russia has employed cyberspace capabilities as part of its invasion of Ukraine, very few observers have the means to observe and assess their impact sufficiently, or understand the degree that commercial, state, or non-state entities aided in the defense of Ukrainian cyberspace.\nWhether Russia failed to develop, integrate, and deliver strategically consequential cyber effects, or the Microsoft, Anonymous, and NATO-supported community-based cyberspace defense efforts succeeded in neutralizing those effects, both potentialities provide logical support to the argument that cyberspace is better suited to geopolitical conflict than war. Russia has demonstrated the ability, when unconstrained by time and comparatively broad in its desired targets or effects, to shut down national electric grids as part of a broader geopolitical effort to destabilize its opponents or competitors.[18] In contrast, it appears that Russia has learned that during war—or a finite game—it needed to count on the effectiveness of specific capabilities and effects against a narrowly defined set of targets on a specific timeline. While military capabilities like tanks, bombers and aircraft carriers offer military planners the ability to predict or make realistic assumptions about the types of effects the military can deliver on a particular timeline, capabilities and vulnerabilities in cyberspace are often ephemeral, offering much less predictability or reliability over time.\nBy comparison, objectives during geopolitical competition are not as often constrained by time, do not always include narrowly defined targets, or demand discrete or tailored effects. Russia's ability to influence the 2016 US election was not only the result of years of effort, but the nature of the political objective meant that Russian actors in cyberspace had nearly unlimited targets and potential effects they could reasonably claim to be influencing the election. Additionally, as is often the case with well-conceived information operations, the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which Russia compromised the election created additional division and distrust within the electorate. Russia also had the benefit of rehearsals for its techniques, having targeted several elections in Belarus, Ukraine, and, of course, its own internal elections since 2007.[19]\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChinese IP theft via cyberspace is similarly a matter of geopolitical competition in which China, seeking to out-compete the US over time, pursues broad objectives against a diverse set of targets and effects. Washington should carefully reconsider the wisdom of leaning too heavily on its finite-game player (the military) to counter China's infinite-game strategy, while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of whether the US seeks to win, or out-compete, before establishing policies or strategies that direct how it uses national resources to play the game.\nRegardless, if deterrence—or the ability to dissuade Beijing from certain behavior because the perceived benefits do not justify the perceived costs and risks—is the objective of US policy regarding Chinese IP theft, this will require the ability to influence CCP perceptions and intention.²⁰ Targeting and influencing perception requires both capability and credibility. However, before discussing strategies for using capability and credibility to influence perception and intention, it must be understood that existing deterrence theory was developed largely to deter aggression.²¹\nWithin the context of international relations, as well as deterrence theory, aggression is most often a matter of the coercive threat or use of force between states. Yet, it is exceedingly counterproductive to limit the conversation of cyberattacks to this narrow context, not only because most attacks in cyberspace offer poor analogical parallel to the concept of force in the physical world, but also because force is not defined in the United Nations (UN) Charter. To date neither the US nor China—despite overwhelming evidence of cyberattacks that undermine their national interests and threaten the security of their critical infrastructure—has invoked the protection of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibiting the use of force. That neither state has claimed this protection supports the assertion that most cyberattacks should not be considered within the context of military force employment.\n## NO LAWS OF UNARMED CONFLICT: REVISITING OUR THEORIES, LAWS, AND CONCEPTS\nWithout international consensus characterizing the preponderance of state behavior in cyberspace as \"force,\" logic should then demand skepticism among cyber policymakers regarding the wholesale applicability, and advisability of deference to, existing theories, laws, and norms surrounding the conventional use of force to competition or conflict in cyberspace. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), for instance, is a body of international law intended to limit humanitarian impacts caused during the use of force between states. If there is no existing law or normative international agreement characterizing state cyberattacks against other states as force, what is the virtue or value of allowing restraining concepts like proportionality, distinction, or military necessity to interfere with the defense—or pursuit, for that matter—of national interests in cyberspace? Why would the US elect to conduct the cognitive gymnastics necessary to frame cyberattacks within the context of LOAC? To avoid the ire of operational law attorneys, this article will sidestep the nuances and technicalities of the legal debate by\nSPRING 2023 | 125\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nsimply asserting that LOAC is an analogically poor framework for regulating state behavior in cyberspace. While there remains insufficient international consensus to establish the type of norms needed to constrain state behavior, insistence upon applying the constraints of LOAC is diffusing US relative power and restraining US ability to deter aggression in cyberspace.\nExtant deterrence theory and policies should be viewed with similar skepticism. Classical deterrence theory, devised to disincentivize the aggressive use of force between states, may prove insufficient in deterring the unique forms of aggressive state behavior seen in cyberspace. In their book *Cross-Domain Deterrence*, Jon R. Lindsey and Erik Gartzke note that classic deterrence theory is itself a historical product of a particular technological innovation—nuclear weapons—and cast doubt on the theory's application to the emergence of new technologies.[22]\nThe unique nature of cyberspace, and the fledgling historical record of competition and conflict therein, also gives reason to question strategic assumptions regarding the propensity for escalation, both within cyberspace as well as the cross-domain variety. In *The Perfect Weapon*, David Sanger notes that one reason the US cannot figure out how to counter cyberattacks is its belief that response incurs a great risk of escalation.[23] However, hesitation by the US to respond to attacks in cyberspace over concerns of escalation is poorly founded, based more on sentiment and abstraction than historical or empirical evidence. To the contrary, two decades of state competition and conflict in cyberspace suggest that a rational actor in the current international system will not use traditional military force as a response to cyberattacks that deliver only economic or information effects. To attribute the observed lack of proliferation in kinetic effects delivered through cyberspace to some inherently deterrent influence of cyberpower itself is logically lacking, as the cyber domain in that situation becomes merely a medium for cross-domain kinetic effect.\nIt is also logically consistent that the effects of conventional deterrence would have cross-domain influence, deterring escalation from cyber effect to kinetic action both internally and externally to the cyber domain. It stands to reason that any cyberattack that delivers armed attack equivalent effects will be treated by a state no differently than conventional force employment. In such a case, the medium of delivery is logically relevant, but should be inconsequential, as there would be little rational reason for a state to treat such an attack any differently than the use of land, maritime, or air power to deliver conventional force.\nIt can also be counterproductive to constrain thinking on national cybersecurity to extant military theory or doctrine. For instance, the wisdom of Clausewitz contributes to the theoretical foundations of belligerency the assertion that between two parties with equal means, defense is not only easier than attack but is the stronger and more superior form of fighting.[24] Here it should be noted that Clausewitz differentiates between \"pure defense,\" or the act of waiting for a blow that permanently leaves the initiative with the enemy, and \"relative defense,\" which encompasses both defensive and offensive maneuver for the purpose of either attriting the enemy or deliberately manipulating time and/or space in order to negate an enemy's temporal\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nadvantage or influence the enemy's decision calculus.²⁵ Clausewitz casts pure defense aside as contrary to the very idea of war. In cyberspace pure defense—static defense measures such as firewalls, antivirus scanners, personal security products, and other automated security tools employed and monitored by system administrators and network defenders—certainly has an important place in geopolitical competition, conflict, and war.\nClausewitz’s characterization of the asymmetries of interest and the nature of interplay between the offense and defense, as well as other supporting arguments for the general superiority of the defense, also apply inconsistently to conflict in cyberspace. The unique aspects of cyberspace, including the inherent obfuscation of identity, the relative ease of concealing digital presence and activities, the lack of geographic buffers, and the compression of both time and distance, combine to provide distinct advantages to the attacker over the defender.²⁶ In an infinite game, the advantages of maneuver, objective, initiative, economy of force, unity of command, simplicity, speed, and surprise all belong to the offense.\nWhile the debate over the comparative advantages of offense or defense in cyberspace is unlikely to culminate in foreseeable future, the 21st century experience suggests that while the best defense in cyberspace might require some offensive action, deterrence in cyberspace will undoubtedly require both. Deterrence by denial—or lowering an adversary’s expectation of success—is supported through improved cybersecurity and defensive measures intended to frustrate, mitigate, or prevent cyberattacks. Yet, there are dual asymmetries to resolve in deterring IP theft through cyberspace. First, the fundamental and inherent asymmetry between the significant potential benefits and comparatively low costs and barriers to entry makes it difficult to deter IP theft exclusively through defense. This, combined with an asymmetry of vulnerability created by US commitment to open societies, capitalist market-based economies, and global interdependency, makes it unlikely that defense alone can achieve deterrence.\nThe fact that China’s IP theft occurs within an infinite game only compounds this reality. In an infinite game, the low cost of offense and significant financial and manpower costs of defense make it is unrealistic to expect defense alone to reduce state perceptions of benefit sufficiently to a level that achieves deterrence over time. While the continued maturation of security-focused network architectures such as zero-trust, as well as increased integration of automation or even artificial intelligence, may with time improve the effectiveness of defense and cybersecurity, there is little reason to doubt that offensive techniques and attack capabilities will be similarly improved in the time needed to implement these defensive measures. Yet, when reduced perception or likelihood of benefit is combined with increased perception of costs and risks, achieved through consistent and credible punishment, deterrence might be possible.\nOn top of the need to critically evaluate the applicability of existing theory, laws, and norms to cyberspace, it is prudent to reflect on US cyber policy, as the credibility of US national response to Chinese IP theft has been constrained by a variety of policy and bureaucratic\nSPRING 2023 | 127\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nlimitations across presidential administrations.27 One such constraining influence is America's strategic culture, which is the idea that deeply rooted cultural preferences exert influence on strategic choices, and that a nation's security history imposes a certain inertia on the decisions of the state in a way that can make strategy less responsive to modern evolutions in the character of competition and conflict.28 In cyberspace, an artifact of the multi-decade Cold War is that the US maintains a significant strategic preference for intelligence over effects. Since 2011, options for decisive offensive cyber operations in response to cyberattacks have been presented regularly to national leadership. A common objection to offensive operations, often coming from the U.S. Intelligence Community, is that offensive action poses risk to intelligence collection capabilities while delivering only a limited or short-lived benefit.29 However, consistent deference to this view has destroyed Washington's ability to establish the credibility needed to deter cyber aggression. The predictability of the US strategic preference for economic stability, diplomatic influence, and intelligence collection over deterrence in cyberspace inexorably undermines its own credibility.\nWhile strategic culture is certainly an obstacle, the challenge of attribution also constrains US thinking and consistency of action in cyberspace.30 Cyber attribution, the process of identifying and laying blame on the actor of a cyberattack, is strained by many unique aspects of cyberspace itself. The logical rules that govern how networked devices communicate serve to obfuscate identity in a way that is understandably confusing to a lawyer or a politician, but much less so to a trained cyber professional. The challenge of convincing non-technical policy and decision-makers of the significance and accuracy of cyber forensics evidence has certainly contributed to a decade of failure deterring aggression in cyberspace. The US must mature not only its understanding of attribution, but its willingness to act in situations of attributional uncertainty, if the nation is to achieve the consistency of action needed for deterrence.\nThere are five “elements” of attributing action in cyberspace, including persona, geopolitical, geographic, logical, and physical layers. Each element can be independently and definitively determined through advanced cyber forensics. An in-depth articulation of the nuances of each element is not needed to understand the greater point: the US should reject the thinking that all five elements of attribution must be satisfied to justify action in response to cyberattacks. Currently, US decision-makers are holding attribution for actions in cyberspace to an unnecessarily high standard when each singular element of attribution offers a unique objective justification for a wide variety of potential national response actions. In other domains, decisions regarding US military action are often made based on comprehensive, multi-factor intelligence assessments. The same type of assessment is possible in cyberspace.\n## ADDRESSING THE CONSTRAINTS OF ATTRIBUTION\nA multi-factor cyberspace attribution assessment would combine cyber forensics evidence with an analysis of the historical records of cyberattacks, economic and geopolitical\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nmotivations, as well as signals and human intelligence, to enable analysts to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive, contextually informed confidence assessment. This framework would deliberately allow for some subjectivity, including an assessment of whether a cyberattack is consistent with enemy state interests, previously attributed cyberattacks, or known state cyber capabilities and signatures. Combining objective forensics evidence with subjective intelligence analysis should serve to improve the comfort level of decision-makers in approving and directing timely and decisive action in response to cyberattacks.\nThe US cyber response playbook should include the widest possible variety of punitive and responsive legal, diplomatic, informational, economic, and military actions. Such actions should include international or domestic indictment, as well as the colloquial \"name and shame\" brand of embarrassing public statements and condemnation. In 2015, President Obama demonstrated that the evidence of cyberattacks can be used quite effectively as leverage during diplomatic or trade negotiations.[31] The US should also expand its use of economic punishment measures to target the material interests of not only national governments, but also private commercial entities that enable enemy cyberattacks. In addition, of course, the US can use overt, covert, or clandestine offensive cyberspace operations for a wide variety of deliberate effects. Each of these potential responses receives a unique degree of logical support from the individual elements of attribution.\nFor example, consider a cyberattack in which the US can definitively identify the physical devices used during an attack, as well as the geographic location—in, such as China—of the equipment during the attack. Without the ability to attribute the persona element or geopolitical association (individual hacktivist versus government-sanctioned operative) of the attacker, it is perfectly reasonable to take certain playbook options, like indictment, off the table. However, given the location of the attack origin, this partial attribution offers at least some value as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, while actions targeting the device(s) or the material interests of any identified enablers would also be justified. For the sake of contrast, in the less common scenario in which the identity and geopolitical association of an attacker can be attributed, the entire playbook should be viewed as available, with or without definitive attribution of the physical or logical layers of the equipment used during the attack.\nYet, obfuscation of identity is only one way that the challenge of attribution strains a state's ability to deter aggression in cyberspace. Not only is it possible for a skilled cyber actor to obfuscate or destroy digital evidence of their presence and actions, but attributional efforts are further frustrated by the pace of technological change, the inherent and real-time customizability of cyberspace capabilities, and the omnipresent need for secrecy to protect both capabilities and a state's awareness of adversary vulnerabilities. The consequence here is that attributing action in cyberspace will, for the foreseeable future, undermine the type of timely, transactional, and associative punitive response needed to sufficiently signal to adversaries a correlation between cause and effect.\nSPRING 2023 | 129\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThis inescapable delay between cyberattack and punishment poses a serious problem within the cognitive confines of classical deterrence theory, as a state that intends to signal or deliver punishment for undesirable behavior needs to do so in a timely and associative manner. With the nature of cyberspace naturally complicating timely response, perhaps deterrence in cyberspace demands that states evolve thinking beyond transactional tit-for-tat responses to seemingly isolated incidents of cyberattacks, and instead respond comprehensively to the collective and cumulative impacts of an adversary's actions to the state's national interests.\nLucas Kello, the director of the Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, expands upon this idea in his 2021 article in the Journal of Cybersecurity: \"Cyber Legalism: why it fails and what to do about it.\" In the article, Kello articulates four principles that should inform better doctrine for cyber conflict. His first principle, the \"accretional principle,\" suggests that states should treat attacks as strategic campaigns, not individual actions.[32] If cyberattacks were punished cumulatively, it would allow a state to target the psychological component of adversarial decision making without the constraints of time, possibly even reducing the burden of attribution through aggregation. Similar to the Clausewitzian notion of relative defense, a strategy that observes the accretional principle would allow the victim of cyberattacks to maintain initiative by delivering penalties in a concentrated fashion and controlling key conditions of the interaction—namely time and location. This effectively enables the defender to determine, and when desirable obfuscate, the threshold of aggregate harm that triggers punishment. The \"many possible permutations of punishable actions and their attendant penalties give the defender a wide scope of maneuver,\" introducing the type of uncertainty that should complicate an adversary's risk-benefit analysis. Well-executed, the ability to deliberately create uncertainty could reasonably cause an adversary to guess conservatively about the location of the line of response, delivering a deterrent effect on the utilization of cyberattack.[33]\n# OBSTACLES AND IMPEDIMENTS: COMPETING INTERESTS AND POOR NATIONAL UNITY OF EFFORT\nIf deterrence demands both capability and credibility, then why has deterrence failed in cyberspace? While the US is the \"world's stealthiest, most skilled cyber power,\"[34] since 2006, it has also been the target of more significant cyberattacks than the next seven countries combined.[35] Despite possessing tremendous cyber capabilities and capacity—military and commercial alike—the US is not feared in cyberspace.[36] While this observation demands a theory-based articulation of whether the nature of cyberspace complicates or precludes coercion, such an endeavor is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, it is enough to simply observe that while China is undoubtedly aware of US cyber capabilities, it is increasingly convinced of Washington's lack of resolve to use those capabilities to punish its behavior.[37] However, even if the US can broaden its view of cyberspace, resolve the limitations of its strategic culture, expand its view of attribution, and deliver a strategy that increases its willingness to act, certain obstacles and impediments still weaken the foundations of US deterrent potential in cyberspace.\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nOne such impediment is the lack of trust, communication, collaboration, and cooperation between the government and the private sector. When Google executives were notified in 2009 that the Chinese had compromised their systems, they waited nearly a year to acknowledge the attack publicly. Moreover, Google did not reveal the full extent of the exposure; a server used to store court orders from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had also been compromised. Google's response was not unusual—when targeted by a cyberattack, most American corporations turn to private cybersecurity firms, and are hesitant to work with the US government due to concerns over what federal investigators might find in their computer systems.38 This hesitation to cooperate is based on a lack of trust, which is a natural consequence of competing interests. The private sector fears that the government will pursue its other interests, namely law enforcement, while casting aside corporate concerns over publicity or economic ramifications whenever such interests impede investigation.\nWhile progress on this front may already be underway, there is still much work to be done. In 2018, the US created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a subordinate agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Agency seeks to work across public and private sectors, challenging traditional ways of doing business by engaging with government, industry, academic, and international partners.39 This type of work should posture CISA to pursue the kind of “civilian military government (CMG) integration” needed to incentivize collaboration and cooperation between the public and private sectors. What is missing is transparency and clarity regarding the nature of CISA's relationship with the Intelligence Community (IC), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\nTo partially mitigate the concerns of the private sector, the US government must pass legislation prohibiting CISA from collecting or storing privately owned data found during its cybersecurity response, operations, or forensics investigation activities, while also requiring corporate anonymization in threat reporting to protect corporate interests. Legislation must also clarify that CISA has no investigatory authorities with respect to domestic laws and prohibit any cooperation or communication with the FBI that does not directly advance collective national cybersecurity. Such measures would improve the private sector's perception of this new organization by demonstrating that CISA is capable of, and committed to, pursuing cybersecurity separate from other government functions, helping to establish trust and encourage national collaboration and cooperation unfettered by competing interests.\nAchieving CMG integration would significantly improve two additional challenges that the nation faces in the pursuit of national cybersecurity: a lack of shared understanding of cyber threats and poor unity of effort toward the common interests of cybersecurity. Currently, if thought of as a collective entity, the national “cyber talent pool” is highly fractured and disconnected. Large telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Comcast have very talented infrastructure managers. Silicon Valley attracts software engineering experts. Norton and FireEye target cyber forensics and reverse engineering specialists. There is a large community\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nof independent penetration testers and certified ethical hackers throughout the country. The National Security Agency offers its civil servants the opportunity to specialize in cryptography, code breaking, or intelligence work, and those drawn to the uniform can pursue each of these specialties, and more, by service in one of the uniformed services, and through them the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). However, the tremendous economic incentives of the US private sector make it difficult, if not entirely unrealistic, for the government to recruit and retain the nation's top cyberspace talent. CMG integration may offer an opportunity to partially address this challenge.\nFor well over a decade, there has been an ongoing debate in the US regarding the ethical and security ramifications of allowing the victims of cyberattacks to \"hack-back.\" The idea is poorly received by many, often citing concerns over escalation to war. However, it is nothing short of injustice for the government to acknowledge that it does not have the authorities or capacity to defend private commercial interests, while also constraining the response options of commercial victims of cyberattacks.[40] The fundamental implication of the \"defend forward\" element of the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy is that defending US government networks, critical infrastructure, and key resources requires a willingness and ability to regularly operate beyond US networks in order to disrupt, degrade, or deny adversary offensive capabilities before they reach America's digital shores. It is a phenomenal policy that has clearly improved USCYBERCOM's ability to identify, neutralize, or exploit threats to US government networks. However, the strategy also exposes an injustice, as US law and policy preclude Silicon Valley from taking similar measures, when necessary, to defend its own networks or commercial interests. China does not observe the US delineation between private or public, only national interests. While the US government's position is that the private sector should invest appropriately to defend its networks, defense is clearly not enough.\nSetting aside abstract principled objections, or even existing US or international law, the reality is that restricting the private sector's immense cyber talent from taking the necessary actions to defend US economic interests in cyberspace undermines both collective cybersecurity and deterrence. To marginalize the technical talent of the private sector operationally is akin to a football team that keeps its star players on the bench. If the US thought of cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition, and not merely a domain of military or government conflict, it would not hesitate to fully leverage the best talent available to win the game. Since such a fundamental change to how the US thinks and operates in cyberspace seems unlikely in the near term, improving CMG integration might offer a meaningful compromise.\nOnce CISA establishes a collaborative cybersecurity community that improves the national sight picture of cyber threats, it could assume an additional role by giving the private sector a central point of contact for requesting offensive action in response to foreign cyber aggression against its corporate or economic interests. CISA would then coordinate with the appropriate agency to seek approval of the operation, affording the aggrieved company the opportunity\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nto provide relevant information, and possibly even offer materiel or technical support, toward achieving responsive remedial—and ideally deterrent—action. Imagine, for a moment, Silicon Valley engineers collaborating with the offensive teams of USCYBERCOM to execute timely action in response to China's cyber aggression. This future operation would have better access to both threat intelligence and cyber talent than the current siloed model, with improved capability and credibility—and trust—setting a more solid foundation for deterrence.\n# CONCLUSION\nChina is very effectively using cyberspace to marginalize whatever relative power advantage the US might possess, and this has Beijing on a strategic azimuth to surpass Washington in terms of relative power. Despite possessing more capacity and capability than any nation in the world, the US has been unable to leverage its national abilities to deter undesirable Chinese behavior in cyberspace.^[41]^ This inability to achieve consensus reflects the fact that the US attempts to understand cyberspace largely through analogical reasoning, seeking conceptual understanding through the lens of existing phenomena like war or domestic and international law. This is a fundamentally flawed and limited approach that will continue to contribute to constrained thinking and national policy. Thucydides never would have imagined a world where the strong suffer what they must, while the weak do what they can. By broadening its view of cyberspace, resolving the constraints of its own theories, policies and thinking, and improving private and public sector cooperation, the US can build a better foundation from which to take the type of consistent and credible action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.^[42]^\n# DISCLAIMER\nThe views expressed in this work are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of the United States Military Academy, the Department of the Army, or the Department of Defense.\nSPRING 2023 | 133\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE",

Despite the clear threat, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of cyberspace, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and conceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over other competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.\nWhen Thucydides wrote of envisioned dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, in 400 B.C, one cannot help but wonder whether he knew his words would influence thinking on power and conflict for centuries. A single quote from this Athenian general can be claimed the very progenitor of international relations theory: \"The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\"¹ This anarchic nature of the international political system creates an inherent danger and drives states to concern themselves primarily with power and security.² While the realities of the 21st century have not changed this natural tension between states, they have changed the tactics and strategies states employ.

China has adapted to this reality faster than the United States (US), stealing trillions of dollars in intellectual property (IP) from America's commercial industries and research and development (R&amp;D) from its defense industrial base.⁴ Despite this demonstrated and significant threat to its relative power, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of the cyberspace domain, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and ceding to the influences of its own strategic culture.

Certainly, any deterrence strategy should account for the unique motives, costs, and risks of specific undesirable adversary behavior. For example, Russian state-led efforts to destabilize US institutions and manipulate the electorate involve benefits, costs, and risks that are distinct in scope, scale, and influence when compared to a non-state actor's relatively simplistic employment of ransomware to obtain economic resources. To influence an adversary's decision calculus and deter undesirable behavior, deterrence strategies should be deliberately catered to these unique considerations. The question is, then: Of the myriad ways China uses cyberspace in the pursuit of its national interests, what specific behavior should the US seek to deter?\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChina's laws, policies, and actions indicate three overarching priorities in cyberspace: domestic control and regime stability, espionage, and access to technology.⁵ The worldwide expansion of the Internet toward the end of the 20ᵗʰ century was largely shaped by the West. The thinking amongst the technological elite was that expanded connectivity, access to information, and unrestricted digital speech would have a liberalizing influence on the world, tempering and marginalizing authoritarian rule. Unfortunately, China quickly recognized the Internet's potential for unregulated free speech and uncontrolled proliferation of information, which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as existential threats to party security, control, and legitimacy.⁶ In response, by implementing measures such as the \"Great Firewall,\" as well as state-leveraged intermediary liability and a state-controlled information technology industry, the CCP has managed to turn the Internet into a massive tool of domestic surveillance and censorship.⁷ While this state behavior is at odds with the values of American democratic society, it should not be the primary focus of deterrence.\nChina's second priority in cyberspace, espionage, is complicated by matters of moral authority and legitimacy. The US, having significantly shaped and influenced the current rules-based international order, is committed to the norms and laws of the system and seeks to maintain international support through action that is consistent with its principles. James Clapper, then Director of National Intelligence, stated in 2015 that in cyberspace \"there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack.\"⁸ This recognition that the US conducts cyber espionage tacitly acknowledges the legitimacy of espionage in cyberspace. It also tangentially supports both the idea that espionage is a sovereign right and the belief that espionage has a fundamentally stabilizing influence in the international system, as improved awareness of adversary capabilities can temper expectations of benefit from the use of force. While the US should expect states to continue cyber espionage, a policy of deterrence would be manifest hypocrisy.\nWe then consider China's third priority in cyberspace—access to technology. China has demonstrated an extensive willingness and ability to exploit and access public and private networks worldwide in the pursuit of information and IP, particularly defense-related or technologically innovative R&amp;D.⁹ China's IP theft should not be dismissed as merely a private sector or economic concern. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center emphasizes this in its 2018 annual report, depicting foreign economic and industrial espionage as a significant threat to US prosperity, security, and competitive advantage.¹⁰ China's ability to reap the benefit of massive American investments in military and commercial R&amp;D diffuses US relative power within the international system. It also allows China to negate one of the most consequential competitive advantages of America's democratic, capitalist system over China's authoritarian, state-planned economy—the innovative forces of economic incentive in an open-market system.¹¹\nSPRING 2023 | 121\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe US has been slow to realize, and slower still to respond to, the gravity of the threat posed by China's theft of IP. The speed and operational tradecraft, as well as the breadth and diversity of targets involved, strain Washington's ability to appreciate the scope and scale of the collective impact to US national interests. For the sake of comparison, the military is quite proficient at contextualizing the direct, tangible threat that adversary military forces pose to national security. Weapon system ranges, hypersonic weapon speeds, operational reach, and force projection are all relatively easily understood and measured concepts that translate well to traditional conceptualizations of threats to national security. What is more difficult to measure, and thereby contextualize in degree and severity of vulnerability and effect, is the cumulative impact of comparatively abstract grey zone threats and attacks that target the intersection of security and other national interests.\nFor example, Russian social media disinformation and misinformation efforts target a state's national psyche, polarizing the electorate and undermining a democratic state's ability to achieve political and social consensus by exploiting the seams among freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and national security. Chinese IP theft exploits a different vulnerability: the seams among national security, commercial enterprise, and economic prosperity. When adversaries target these seams, they create not only uncertainty about the extent of what is happening but also an inability or unwillingness to coordinate and execute the type of assertive, credible, associative, and timely national response needed to achieve deterrence. Yet, purely with respect to economic prosperity and relative power, the collective costs of cyberattacks may very well compete with or outweigh the net costs of any war in US history.\n# CYBERSPACE: UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON\nTo improve the conceptual foundations needed to deliver policies and strategies that could realistically create the conditions needed for deterrence, the US must first expand how it views the phenomenon of cyberspace. Throughout much of the 21st century, the government and military communities debated the question of whether or not cyberspace is a domain of warfare, equal in status and warfighting significance to the maritime, land, air, and space domains.[12] This particular question appears to be at least partially resolved, with the military's position apparent in its definition of \"cyberspace\" in Joint Publication 3-12: \"the domain [emphasis added] within the information environment that consists of the interdependent network of information technology (IT) infrastructures and resident data.\"[13]\nA myopic focus on the military aspects of cyberspace is insufficient for the US to pursue and defend its national interests. While cyberspace certainly creates opportunities and vulnerabilities during war, it also offers US enemies a low-cost opportunity to pursue their strategic interests during peace, entirely negating the coercive and deterrent influences of US economic and military might. This ability of a state or an individual actor to pursue their interests through cyberspace, unthreatened and unimpeded by any relative power asymmetries that\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nexist, suggests that the environment should not be thought of as the \"fourth military offset,\" but as an international relations offset.¹⁴ The figure below depicts cyberspace not merely as a military domain, but a broad spectrum, while also highlighting the relatively small portion of cyberspace where the military primarily operates.\n|  Competition |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | Conflict  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Social Functions |   | Economic Functions |   |   | Government Functions  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Medical | Academia | Media | Commercial | Industrial | Law Enforcement | Homeland Security | Foreign | Military |   |\nFigure 1: Cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition and conflict.\nCyberspace is not a domain where national business is conducted, and national interests are pursued in isolated silos. Instead, the US must view cyberspace as a broad and interconnected spectrum that supports and enables the sources and instruments of national power across the entire continuum of competition to conflict on a geopolitical—not just a military—battlefield.\nYet, the continued evolution of war, and therefore the military instrument of national power, has resulted in a US military that performs functions and duties that go well beyond traditional armed conflict. From nation-building, including the construction of schools and hospitals or training of judges and politicians in Afghanistan, to humanitarian assistance, disaster recovery, and agricultural development in Africa, the military is no longer a simple hammer, but has become a geopolitical multi-purpose tool.¹⁵ However, while the modern US military is capable of far more than applying conventional force in the pursuit of political objectives, this does not change the fact that it is still built primarily for war. This belligerent purpose not only influences military culture, recruitment efforts, virtues, and norms, but drives how the military trains and disciplines itself, educates its leaders, and is entirely deterministic in how it identifies, prioritizes, develops, and acquires its capabilities. War is not merely what the military plans for but shapes the very process that the military uses to plan.\nWithin game theory, a finite game is one in which either the rules of the game or the incentives of the players serve to ensure that the game ends with clear winners and losers. Since nations in an armed conflict seek or are generally incentivized to end the conflict, a declared period of war is a finite game. Geopolitical competition between the US and China, however, is an infinite game, since it is reasonable to assert that neither party is sufficiently incentivized realistically to seek a permanent and definitive culmination of the competition.¹⁶ Instead, both parties seek to establish and exploit their own competitive advantages while avoiding or negating their opponent's comparative strengths. Understanding the temporal character of both competition and conflict should inform, if not determine, the dominant strategies of the game, influencing how players think about time, resources, maneuver, and objectives. The macro trends of twenty-first century competition and conflict thus far indicate that while the nature of cyberspace provides actors with ample opportunity for influence, espionage, exploitation, and subversion, the environment is significantly less conducive to coercion than other domains.\nSPRING 2023 | 123\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nAn important implication here may be that cyberspace is better suited for the pursuit of broad objectives in an infinite game, as opposed to the narrowly defined and time-constrained objectives of a finite game.\nFor instance, Moscow's failure to meaningfully disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate its national defense through employment of cyber capabilities prior to or during Russia's invasion supports the idea that cyberspace is better postured for broad geopolitical competition objectives than discrete, narrowly tailored war objectives. Despite a decade of politicians, military leaders, academics, and pundits alike predicting a future conflict largely decided by cyber means, it does not appear that Russia mounted a consequential cyber offensive as part of its invasion. This has caused some to doubt the current or future strategic utility of cyberspace.[17] However, prudence demands caution before making definitive statements or attempting conclusions regarding Russia's failure, as both time and declassification are equally likely to disprove many seemingly factual observations. If Russia has employed cyberspace capabilities as part of its invasion of Ukraine, very few observers have the means to observe and assess their impact sufficiently, or understand the degree that commercial, state, or non-state entities aided in the defense of Ukrainian cyberspace.\nWhether Russia failed to develop, integrate, and deliver strategically consequential cyber effects, or the Microsoft, Anonymous, and NATO-supported community-based cyberspace defense efforts succeeded in neutralizing those effects, both potentialities provide logical support to the argument that cyberspace is better suited to geopolitical conflict than war. Russia has demonstrated the ability, when unconstrained by time and comparatively broad in its desired targets or effects, to shut down national electric grids as part of a broader geopolitical effort to destabilize its opponents or competitors.[18] In contrast, it appears that Russia has learned that during war—or a finite game—it needed to count on the effectiveness of specific capabilities and effects against a narrowly defined set of targets on a specific timeline. While military capabilities like tanks, bombers and aircraft carriers offer military planners the ability to predict or make realistic assumptions about the types of effects the military can deliver on a particular timeline, capabilities and vulnerabilities in cyberspace are often ephemeral, offering much less predictability or reliability over time.\nBy comparison, objectives during geopolitical competition are not as often constrained by time, do not always include narrowly defined targets, or demand discrete or tailored effects. Russia's ability to influence the 2016 US election was not only the result of years of effort, but the nature of the political objective meant that Russian actors in cyberspace had nearly unlimited targets and potential effects they could reasonably claim to be influencing the election. Additionally, as is often the case with well-conceived information operations, the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which Russia compromised the election created additional division and distrust within the electorate. Russia also had the benefit of rehearsals for its techniques, having targeted several elections in Belarus, Ukraine, and, of course, its own internal elections since 2007.[19]\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChinese IP theft via cyberspace is similarly a matter of geopolitical competition in which China, seeking to out-compete the US over time, pursues broad objectives against a diverse set of targets and effects. Washington should carefully reconsider the wisdom of leaning too heavily on its finite-game player (the military) to counter China's infinite-game strategy, while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of whether the US seeks to win, or out-compete, before establishing policies or strategies that direct how it uses national resources to play the game.\nRegardless, if deterrence—or the ability to dissuade Beijing from certain behavior because the perceived benefits do not justify the perceived costs and risks—is the objective of US policy regarding Chinese IP theft, this will require the ability to influence CCP perceptions and intention.²⁰ Targeting and influencing perception requires both capability and credibility. However, before discussing strategies for using capability and credibility to influence perception and intention, it must be understood that existing deterrence theory was developed largely to deter aggression.²¹\nWithin the context of international relations, as well as deterrence theory, aggression is most often a matter of the coercive threat or use of force between states. Yet, it is exceedingly counterproductive to limit the conversation of cyberattacks to this narrow context, not only because most attacks in cyberspace offer poor analogical parallel to the concept of force in the physical world, but also because force is not defined in the United Nations (UN) Charter. To date neither the US nor China—despite overwhelming evidence of cyberattacks that undermine their national interests and threaten the security of their critical infrastructure—has invoked the protection of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibiting the use of force. That neither state has claimed this protection supports the assertion that most cyberattacks should not be considered within the context of military force employment.\n## NO LAWS OF UNARMED CONFLICT: REVISITING OUR THEORIES, LAWS, AND CONCEPTS\nWithout international consensus characterizing the preponderance of state behavior in cyberspace as \"force,\" logic should then demand skepticism among cyber policymakers regarding the wholesale applicability, and advisability of deference to, existing theories, laws, and norms surrounding the conventional use of force to competition or conflict in cyberspace. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), for instance, is a body of international law intended to limit humanitarian impacts caused during the use of force between states. If there is no existing law or normative international agreement characterizing state cyberattacks against other states as force, what is the virtue or value of allowing restraining concepts like proportionality, distinction, or military necessity to interfere with the defense—or pursuit, for that matter—of national interests in cyberspace? Why would the US elect to conduct the cognitive gymnastics necessary to frame cyberattacks within the context of LOAC? To avoid the ire of operational law attorneys, this article will sidestep the nuances and technicalities of the legal debate by\nSPRING 2023 | 125\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nsimply asserting that LOAC is an analogically poor framework for regulating state behavior in cyberspace. While there remains insufficient international consensus to establish the type of norms needed to constrain state behavior, insistence upon applying the constraints of LOAC is diffusing US relative power and restraining US ability to deter aggression in cyberspace.\nExtant deterrence theory and policies should be viewed with similar skepticism. Classical deterrence theory, devised to disincentivize the aggressive use of force between states, may prove insufficient in deterring the unique forms of aggressive state behavior seen in cyberspace. In their book *Cross-Domain Deterrence*, Jon R. Lindsey and Erik Gartzke note that classic deterrence theory is itself a historical product of a particular technological innovation—nuclear weapons—and cast doubt on the theory's application to the emergence of new technologies.[22]\nThe unique nature of cyberspace, and the fledgling historical record of competition and conflict therein, also gives reason to question strategic assumptions regarding the propensity for escalation, both within cyberspace as well as the cross-domain variety. In *The Perfect Weapon*, David Sanger notes that one reason the US cannot figure out how to counter cyberattacks is its belief that response incurs a great risk of escalation.[23] However, hesitation by the US to respond to attacks in cyberspace over concerns of escalation is poorly founded, based more on sentiment and abstraction than historical or empirical evidence. To the contrary, two decades of state competition and conflict in cyberspace suggest that a rational actor in the current international system will not use traditional military force as a response to cyberattacks that deliver only economic or information effects. To attribute the observed lack of proliferation in kinetic effects delivered through cyberspace to some inherently deterrent influence of cyberpower itself is logically lacking, as the cyber domain in that situation becomes merely a medium for cross-domain kinetic effect.\nIt is also logically consistent that the effects of conventional deterrence would have cross-domain influence, deterring escalation from cyber effect to kinetic action both internally and externally to the cyber domain. It stands to reason that any cyberattack that delivers armed attack equivalent effects will be treated by a state no differently than conventional force employment. In such a case, the medium of delivery is logically relevant, but should be inconsequential, as there would be little rational reason for a state to treat such an attack any differently than the use of land, maritime, or air power to deliver conventional force.\nIt can also be counterproductive to constrain thinking on national cybersecurity to extant military theory or doctrine. For instance, the wisdom of Clausewitz contributes to the theoretical foundations of belligerency the assertion that between two parties with equal means, defense is not only easier than attack but is the stronger and more superior form of fighting.[24] Here it should be noted that Clausewitz differentiates between \"pure defense,\" or the act of waiting for a blow that permanently leaves the initiative with the enemy, and \"relative defense,\" which encompasses both defensive and offensive maneuver for the purpose of either attriting the enemy or deliberately manipulating time and/or space in order to negate an enemy's temporal\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nadvantage or influence the enemy's decision calculus.²⁵ Clausewitz casts pure defense aside as contrary to the very idea of war. In cyberspace pure defense—static defense measures such as firewalls, antivirus scanners, personal security products, and other automated security tools employed and monitored by system administrators and network defenders—certainly has an important place in geopolitical competition, conflict, and war.\nClausewitz’s characterization of the asymmetries of interest and the nature of interplay between the offense and defense, as well as other supporting arguments for the general superiority of the defense, also apply inconsistently to conflict in cyberspace. The unique aspects of cyberspace, including the inherent obfuscation of identity, the relative ease of concealing digital presence and activities, the lack of geographic buffers, and the compression of both time and distance, combine to provide distinct advantages to the attacker over the defender.²⁶ In an infinite game, the advantages of maneuver, objective, initiative, economy of force, unity of command, simplicity, speed, and surprise all belong to the offense.\nWhile the debate over the comparative advantages of offense or defense in cyberspace is unlikely to culminate in foreseeable future, the 21st century experience suggests that while the best defense in cyberspace might require some offensive action, deterrence in cyberspace will undoubtedly require both. Deterrence by denial—or lowering an adversary’s expectation of success—is supported through improved cybersecurity and defensive measures intended to frustrate, mitigate, or prevent cyberattacks. Yet, there are dual asymmetries to resolve in deterring IP theft through cyberspace. First, the fundamental and inherent asymmetry between the significant potential benefits and comparatively low costs and barriers to entry makes it difficult to deter IP theft exclusively through defense. This, combined with an asymmetry of vulnerability created by US commitment to open societies, capitalist market-based economies, and global interdependency, makes it unlikely that defense alone can achieve deterrence.\nThe fact that China’s IP theft occurs within an infinite game only compounds this reality. In an infinite game, the low cost of offense and significant financial and manpower costs of defense make it is unrealistic to expect defense alone to reduce state perceptions of benefit sufficiently to a level that achieves deterrence over time. While the continued maturation of security-focused network architectures such as zero-trust, as well as increased integration of automation or even artificial intelligence, may with time improve the effectiveness of defense and cybersecurity, there is little reason to doubt that offensive techniques and attack capabilities will be similarly improved in the time needed to implement these defensive measures. Yet, when reduced perception or likelihood of benefit is combined with increased perception of costs and risks, achieved through consistent and credible punishment, deterrence might be possible.\nOn top of the need to critically evaluate the applicability of existing theory, laws, and norms to cyberspace, it is prudent to reflect on US cyber policy, as the credibility of US national response to Chinese IP theft has been constrained by a variety of policy and bureaucratic\nSPRING 2023 | 127\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nlimitations across presidential administrations.27 One such constraining influence is America's strategic culture, which is the idea that deeply rooted cultural preferences exert influence on strategic choices, and that a nation's security history imposes a certain inertia on the decisions of the state in a way that can make strategy less responsive to modern evolutions in the character of competition and conflict.28 In cyberspace, an artifact of the multi-decade Cold War is that the US maintains a significant strategic preference for intelligence over effects. Since 2011, options for decisive offensive cyber operations in response to cyberattacks have been presented regularly to national leadership. A common objection to offensive operations, often coming from the U.S. Intelligence Community, is that offensive action poses risk to intelligence collection capabilities while delivering only a limited or short-lived benefit.29 However, consistent deference to this view has destroyed Washington's ability to establish the credibility needed to deter cyber aggression. The predictability of the US strategic preference for economic stability, diplomatic influence, and intelligence collection over deterrence in cyberspace inexorably undermines its own credibility.\nWhile strategic culture is certainly an obstacle, the challenge of attribution also constrains US thinking and consistency of action in cyberspace.30 Cyber attribution, the process of identifying and laying blame on the actor of a cyberattack, is strained by many unique aspects of cyberspace itself. The logical rules that govern how networked devices communicate serve to obfuscate identity in a way that is understandably confusing to a lawyer or a politician, but much less so to a trained cyber professional. The challenge of convincing non-technical policy and decision-makers of the significance and accuracy of cyber forensics evidence has certainly contributed to a decade of failure deterring aggression in cyberspace. The US must mature not only its understanding of attribution, but its willingness to act in situations of attributional uncertainty, if the nation is to achieve the consistency of action needed for deterrence.\nThere are five “elements” of attributing action in cyberspace, including persona, geopolitical, geographic, logical, and physical layers. Each element can be independently and definitively determined through advanced cyber forensics. An in-depth articulation of the nuances of each element is not needed to understand the greater point: the US should reject the thinking that all five elements of attribution must be satisfied to justify action in response to cyberattacks. Currently, US decision-makers are holding attribution for actions in cyberspace to an unnecessarily high standard when each singular element of attribution offers a unique objective justification for a wide variety of potential national response actions. In other domains, decisions regarding US military action are often made based on comprehensive, multi-factor intelligence assessments. The same type of assessment is possible in cyberspace.\n## ADDRESSING THE CONSTRAINTS OF ATTRIBUTION\nA multi-factor cyberspace attribution assessment would combine cyber forensics evidence with an analysis of the historical records of cyberattacks, economic and geopolitical\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nmotivations, as well as signals and human intelligence, to enable analysts to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive, contextually informed confidence assessment. This framework would deliberately allow for some subjectivity, including an assessment of whether a cyberattack is consistent with enemy state interests, previously attributed cyberattacks, or known state cyber capabilities and signatures. Combining objective forensics evidence with subjective intelligence analysis should serve to improve the comfort level of decision-makers in approving and directing timely and decisive action in response to cyberattacks.\nThe US cyber response playbook should include the widest possible variety of punitive and responsive legal, diplomatic, informational, economic, and military actions. Such actions should include international or domestic indictment, as well as the colloquial \"name and shame\" brand of embarrassing public statements and condemnation. In 2015, President Obama demonstrated that the evidence of cyberattacks can be used quite effectively as leverage during diplomatic or trade negotiations.[31] The US should also expand its use of economic punishment measures to target the material interests of not only national governments, but also private commercial entities that enable enemy cyberattacks. In addition, of course, the US can use overt, covert, or clandestine offensive cyberspace operations for a wide variety of deliberate effects. Each of these potential responses receives a unique degree of logical support from the individual elements of attribution.\nFor example, consider a cyberattack in which the US can definitively identify the physical devices used during an attack, as well as the geographic location—in, such as China—of the equipment during the attack. Without the ability to attribute the persona element or geopolitical association (individual hacktivist versus government-sanctioned operative) of the attacker, it is perfectly reasonable to take certain playbook options, like indictment, off the table. However, given the location of the attack origin, this partial attribution offers at least some value as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, while actions targeting the device(s) or the material interests of any identified enablers would also be justified. For the sake of contrast, in the less common scenario in which the identity and geopolitical association of an attacker can be attributed, the entire playbook should be viewed as available, with or without definitive attribution of the physical or logical layers of the equipment used during the attack.\nYet, obfuscation of identity is only one way that the challenge of attribution strains a state's ability to deter aggression in cyberspace. Not only is it possible for a skilled cyber actor to obfuscate or destroy digital evidence of their presence and actions, but attributional efforts are further frustrated by the pace of technological change, the inherent and real-time customizability of cyberspace capabilities, and the omnipresent need for secrecy to protect both capabilities and a state's awareness of adversary vulnerabilities. The consequence here is that attributing action in cyberspace will, for the foreseeable future, undermine the type of timely, transactional, and associative punitive response needed to sufficiently signal to adversaries a correlation between cause and effect.\nSPRING 2023 | 129\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThis inescapable delay between cyberattack and punishment poses a serious problem within the cognitive confines of classical deterrence theory, as a state that intends to signal or deliver punishment for undesirable behavior needs to do so in a timely and associative manner. With the nature of cyberspace naturally complicating timely response, perhaps deterrence in cyberspace demands that states evolve thinking beyond transactional tit-for-tat responses to seemingly isolated incidents of cyberattacks, and instead respond comprehensively to the collective and cumulative impacts of an adversary's actions to the state's national interests.\nLucas Kello, the director of the Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, expands upon this idea in his 2021 article in the Journal of Cybersecurity: \"Cyber Legalism: why it fails and what to do about it.\" In the article, Kello articulates four principles that should inform better doctrine for cyber conflict. His first principle, the \"accretional principle,\" suggests that states should treat attacks as strategic campaigns, not individual actions.[32] If cyberattacks were punished cumulatively, it would allow a state to target the psychological component of adversarial decision making without the constraints of time, possibly even reducing the burden of attribution through aggregation. Similar to the Clausewitzian notion of relative defense, a strategy that observes the accretional principle would allow the victim of cyberattacks to maintain initiative by delivering penalties in a concentrated fashion and controlling key conditions of the interaction—namely time and location. This effectively enables the defender to determine, and when desirable obfuscate, the threshold of aggregate harm that triggers punishment. The \"many possible permutations of punishable actions and their attendant penalties give the defender a wide scope of maneuver,\" introducing the type of uncertainty that should complicate an adversary's risk-benefit analysis. Well-executed, the ability to deliberately create uncertainty could reasonably cause an adversary to guess conservatively about the location of the line of response, delivering a deterrent effect on the utilization of cyberattack.[33]\n# OBSTACLES AND IMPEDIMENTS: COMPETING INTERESTS AND POOR NATIONAL UNITY OF EFFORT\nIf deterrence demands both capability and credibility, then why has deterrence failed in cyberspace? While the US is the \"world's stealthiest, most skilled cyber power,\"[34] since 2006, it has also been the target of more significant cyberattacks than the next seven countries combined.[35] Despite possessing tremendous cyber capabilities and capacity—military and commercial alike—the US is not feared in cyberspace.[36] While this observation demands a theory-based articulation of whether the nature of cyberspace complicates or precludes coercion, such an endeavor is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, it is enough to simply observe that while China is undoubtedly aware of US cyber capabilities, it is increasingly convinced of Washington's lack of resolve to use those capabilities to punish its behavior.[37] However, even if the US can broaden its view of cyberspace, resolve the limitations of its strategic culture, expand its view of attribution, and deliver a strategy that increases its willingness to act, certain obstacles and impediments still weaken the foundations of US deterrent potential in cyberspace.\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nOne such impediment is the lack of trust, communication, collaboration, and cooperation between the government and the private sector. When Google executives were notified in 2009 that the Chinese had compromised their systems, they waited nearly a year to acknowledge the attack publicly. Moreover, Google did not reveal the full extent of the exposure; a server used to store court orders from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had also been compromised. Google's response was not unusual—when targeted by a cyberattack, most American corporations turn to private cybersecurity firms, and are hesitant to work with the US government due to concerns over what federal investigators might find in their computer systems.38 This hesitation to cooperate is based on a lack of trust, which is a natural consequence of competing interests. The private sector fears that the government will pursue its other interests, namely law enforcement, while casting aside corporate concerns over publicity or economic ramifications whenever such interests impede investigation.\nWhile progress on this front may already be underway, there is still much work to be done. In 2018, the US created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a subordinate agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Agency seeks to work across public and private sectors, challenging traditional ways of doing business by engaging with government, industry, academic, and international partners.39 This type of work should posture CISA to pursue the kind of “civilian military government (CMG) integration” needed to incentivize collaboration and cooperation between the public and private sectors. What is missing is transparency and clarity regarding the nature of CISA's relationship with the Intelligence Community (IC), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\nTo partially mitigate the concerns of the private sector, the US government must pass legislation prohibiting CISA from collecting or storing privately owned data found during its cybersecurity response, operations, or forensics investigation activities, while also requiring corporate anonymization in threat reporting to protect corporate interests. Legislation must also clarify that CISA has no investigatory authorities with respect to domestic laws and prohibit any cooperation or communication with the FBI that does not directly advance collective national cybersecurity. Such measures would improve the private sector's perception of this new organization by demonstrating that CISA is capable of, and committed to, pursuing cybersecurity separate from other government functions, helping to establish trust and encourage national collaboration and cooperation unfettered by competing interests.\nAchieving CMG integration would significantly improve two additional challenges that the nation faces in the pursuit of national cybersecurity: a lack of shared understanding of cyber threats and poor unity of effort toward the common interests of cybersecurity. Currently, if thought of as a collective entity, the national “cyber talent pool” is highly fractured and disconnected. Large telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Comcast have very talented infrastructure managers. Silicon Valley attracts software engineering experts. Norton and FireEye target cyber forensics and reverse engineering specialists. There is a large community\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nof independent penetration testers and certified ethical hackers throughout the country. The National Security Agency offers its civil servants the opportunity to specialize in cryptography, code breaking, or intelligence work, and those drawn to the uniform can pursue each of these specialties, and more, by service in one of the uniformed services, and through them the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). However, the tremendous economic incentives of the US private sector make it difficult, if not entirely unrealistic, for the government to recruit and retain the nation's top cyberspace talent. CMG integration may offer an opportunity to partially address this challenge.\nFor well over a decade, there has been an ongoing debate in the US regarding the ethical and security ramifications of allowing the victims of cyberattacks to \"hack-back.\" The idea is poorly received by many, often citing concerns over escalation to war. However, it is nothing short of injustice for the government to acknowledge that it does not have the authorities or capacity to defend private commercial interests, while also constraining the response options of commercial victims of cyberattacks.[40] The fundamental implication of the \"defend forward\" element of the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy is that defending US government networks, critical infrastructure, and key resources requires a willingness and ability to regularly operate beyond US networks in order to disrupt, degrade, or deny adversary offensive capabilities before they reach America's digital shores. It is a phenomenal policy that has clearly improved USCYBERCOM's ability to identify, neutralize, or exploit threats to US government networks. However, the strategy also exposes an injustice, as US law and policy preclude Silicon Valley from taking similar measures, when necessary, to defend its own networks or commercial interests. China does not observe the US delineation between private or public, only national interests. While the US government's position is that the private sector should invest appropriately to defend its networks, defense is clearly not enough.\nSetting aside abstract principled objections, or even existing US or international law, the reality is that restricting the private sector's immense cyber talent from taking the necessary actions to defend US economic interests in cyberspace undermines both collective cybersecurity and deterrence. To marginalize the technical talent of the private sector operationally is akin to a football team that keeps its star players on the bench. If the US thought of cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition, and not merely a domain of military or government conflict, it would not hesitate to fully leverage the best talent available to win the game. Since such a fundamental change to how the US thinks and operates in cyberspace seems unlikely in the near term, improving CMG integration might offer a meaningful compromise.\nOnce CISA establishes a collaborative cybersecurity community that improves the national sight picture of cyber threats, it could assume an additional role by giving the private sector a central point of contact for requesting offensive action in response to foreign cyber aggression against its corporate or economic interests. CISA would then coordinate with the appropriate agency to seek approval of the operation, affording the aggrieved company the opportunity\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nto provide relevant information, and possibly even offer materiel or technical support, toward achieving responsive remedial—and ideally deterrent—action. Imagine, for a moment, Silicon Valley engineers collaborating with the offensive teams of USCYBERCOM to execute timely action in response to China's cyber aggression. This future operation would have better access to both threat intelligence and cyber talent than the current siloed model, with improved capability and credibility—and trust—setting a more solid foundation for deterrence.\n# CONCLUSION\nChina is very effectively using cyberspace to marginalize whatever relative power advantage the US might possess, and this has Beijing on a strategic azimuth to surpass Washington in terms of relative power. Despite possessing more capacity and capability than any nation in the world, the US has been unable to leverage its national abilities to deter undesirable Chinese behavior in cyberspace.^[41]^ This inability to achieve consensus reflects the fact that the US attempts to understand cyberspace largely through analogical reasoning, seeking conceptual understanding through the lens of existing phenomena like war or domestic and international law. This is a fundamentally flawed and limited approach that will continue to contribute to constrained thinking and national policy. Thucydides never would have imagined a world where the strong suffer what they must, while the weak do what they can. By broadening its view of cyberspace, resolving the constraints of its own theories, policies and thinking, and improving private and public sector cooperation, the US can build a better foundation from which to take the type of consistent and credible action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.^[42]^\n# DISCLAIMER\nThe views expressed in this work are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of the United States Military Academy, the Department of the Army, or the Department of Defense.\nSPRING 2023 | 133\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE",

Despite the clear threat, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of cyberspace, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and conceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over other competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.\nWhen Thucydides wrote of envisioned dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, in 400 B.C, one cannot help but wonder whether he knew his words would influence thinking on power and conflict for centuries. A single quote from this Athenian general can be claimed the very progenitor of international relations theory: \"The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\"¹ This anarchic nature of the international political system creates an inherent danger and drives states to concern themselves primarily with power and security.² While the realities of the 21st century have not changed this natural tension between states, they have changed the tactics and strategies states employ. Between great powers, nuclear weapons offer no realistic positive political objective, and the utility of traditional military force has been reduced due to the perceived risk of escalation\nThis is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

After enlisting in the U.S. Army in 2001, he deployed to Iraq in 2003 as a paralegal specialist focused on operational law and criminal justice. He graduated as Dean's Distinguished Graduate and Distinguished Military Graduate from the University of Texas at Austin, commissioning as a Military Intelligence officer. After commanding a counterintelligence detachment, he deployed with Special Operations Joint Task Force-Alghanistan in 2014. Joining Cyber Branch shortly after, he served on a National Mission Team and commanded a cyber company in the 780th MI Brigade, followed by Aide-de-camp to the Commanding General of the Cyber Center of Excellence, and Capability Developer for the Persistent Cyber Training Environment. He is currently the Chief of Cyber/EW Modernization in the Department of the Army Management Office for Strategic Operations.\nto nuclear war.³ This has resulted in an expansion of competition below the level of armed conflict. Cyberspace has catalyzed and accelerated this type of competition. China has adapted to this reality faster than the United States (US), stealing trillions of dollars in intellectual property (IP) from America's commercial industries and research and development (R&amp;D) from its defense industrial base.⁴ Despite this demonstrated and significant threat to its relative power, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of the cyberspace domain, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and ceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter Chinese aggression in cyberspace.\n## THE CHINA THREAT\nBefore discussing the nuances of deterrence, cyberspace, or deterrence in cyberspace, it is prudent to clearly articulate the behavior to be deterred. Certainly, any deterrence strategy should account for the unique motives, costs, and risks of specific undesirable adversary behavior. For example, Russian state-led efforts to destabilize US institutions and manipulate the electorate involve benefits, costs, and risks that are distinct in scope, scale, and influence when compared to a non-state actor's relatively simplistic employment of ransomware to obtain economic resources. To influence an adversary's decision calculus and deter undesirable behavior, deterrence strategies should be deliberately catered to these unique considerations. The question is, then: Of the myriad ways China uses cyberspace in the pursuit of its national interests, what specific behavior should the US seek to deter?\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChina's laws, policies, and actions indicate three overarching priorities in cyberspace: domestic control and regime stability, espionage, and access to technology.⁵ The worldwide expansion of the Internet toward the end of the 20ᵗʰ century was largely shaped by the West. The thinking amongst the technological elite was that expanded connectivity, access to information, and unrestricted digital speech would have a liberalizing influence on the world, tempering and marginalizing authoritarian rule. Unfortunately, China quickly recognized the Internet's potential for unregulated free speech and uncontrolled proliferation of information, which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as existential threats to party security, control, and legitimacy.⁶ In response, by implementing measures such as the \"Great Firewall,\" as well as state-leveraged intermediary liability and a state-controlled information technology industry, the CCP has managed to turn the Internet into a massive tool of domestic surveillance and censorship.⁷ While this state behavior is at odds with the values of American democratic society, it should not be the primary focus of deterrence.\nChina's second priority in cyberspace, espionage, is complicated by matters of moral authority and legitimacy. The US, having significantly shaped and influenced the current rules-based international order, is committed to the norms and laws of the system and seeks to maintain international support through action that is consistent with its principles. James Clapper, then Director of National Intelligence, stated in 2015 that in cyberspace \"there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack.\"⁸ This recognition that the US conducts cyber espionage tacitly acknowledges the legitimacy of espionage in cyberspace. It also tangentially supports both the idea that espionage is a sovereign right and the belief that espionage has a fundamentally stabilizing influence in the international system, as improved awareness of adversary capabilities can temper expectations of benefit from the use of force. While the US should expect states to continue cyber espionage, a policy of deterrence would be manifest hypocrisy.\nWe then consider China's third priority in cyberspace—access to technology. China has demonstrated an extensive willingness and ability to exploit and access public and private networks worldwide in the pursuit of information and IP, particularly defense-related or technologically innovative R&amp;D.⁹ China's IP theft should not be dismissed as merely a private sector or economic concern. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center emphasizes this in its 2018 annual report, depicting foreign economic and industrial espionage as a significant threat to US prosperity, security, and competitive advantage.¹⁰ China's ability to reap the benefit of massive American investments in military and commercial R&amp;D diffuses US relative power within the international system. It also allows China to negate one of the most consequential competitive advantages of America's democratic, capitalist system over China's authoritarian, state-planned economy—the innovative forces of economic incentive in an open-market system.¹¹\nSPRING 2023 | 121\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe US has been slow to realize, and slower still to respond to, the gravity of the threat posed by China's theft of IP. The speed and operational tradecraft, as well as the breadth and diversity of targets involved, strain Washington's ability to appreciate the scope and scale of the collective impact to US national interests. For the sake of comparison, the military is quite proficient at contextualizing the direct, tangible threat that adversary military forces pose to national security. Weapon system ranges, hypersonic weapon speeds, operational reach, and force projection are all relatively easily understood and measured concepts that translate well to traditional conceptualizations of threats to national security. What is more difficult to measure, and thereby contextualize in degree and severity of vulnerability and effect, is the cumulative impact of comparatively abstract grey zone threats and attacks that target the intersection of security and other national interests.\nFor example, Russian social media disinformation and misinformation efforts target a state's national psyche, polarizing the electorate and undermining a democratic state's ability to achieve political and social consensus by exploiting the seams among freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and national security. Chinese IP theft exploits a different vulnerability: the seams among national security, commercial enterprise, and economic prosperity. When adversaries target these seams, they create not only uncertainty about the extent of what is happening but also an inability or unwillingness to coordinate and execute the type of assertive, credible, associative, and timely national response needed to achieve deterrence. Yet, purely with respect to economic prosperity and relative power, the collective costs of cyberattacks may very well compete with or outweigh the net costs of any war in US history.\n# CYBERSPACE: UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON\nTo improve the conceptual foundations needed to deliver policies and strategies that could realistically create the conditions needed for deterrence, the US must first expand how it views the phenomenon of cyberspace. Throughout much of the 21st century, the government and military communities debated the question of whether or not cyberspace is a domain of warfare, equal in status and warfighting significance to the maritime, land, air, and space domains.[12] This particular question appears to be at least partially resolved, with the military's position apparent in its definition of \"cyberspace\" in Joint Publication 3-12: \"the domain [emphasis added] within the information environment that consists of the interdependent network of information technology (IT) infrastructures and resident data.\"[13]\nA myopic focus on the military aspects of cyberspace is insufficient for the US to pursue and defend its national interests. While cyberspace certainly creates opportunities and vulnerabilities during war, it also offers US enemies a low-cost opportunity to pursue their strategic interests during peace, entirely negating the coercive and deterrent influences of US economic and military might. This ability of a state or an individual actor to pursue their interests through cyberspace, unthreatened and unimpeded by any relative power asymmetries that\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nexist, suggests that the environment should not be thought of as the \"fourth military offset,\" but as an international relations offset.¹⁴ The figure below depicts cyberspace not merely as a military domain, but a broad spectrum, while also highlighting the relatively small portion of cyberspace where the military primarily operates.\n|  Competition |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | Conflict  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Social Functions |   | Economic Functions |   |   | Government Functions  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Medical | Academia | Media | Commercial | Industrial | Law Enforcement | Homeland Security | Foreign | Military |   |\nFigure 1: Cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition and conflict.\nCyberspace is not a domain where national business is conducted, and national interests are pursued in isolated silos. Instead, the US must view cyberspace as a broad and interconnected spectrum that supports and enables the sources and instruments of national power across the entire continuum of competition to conflict on a geopolitical—not just a military—battlefield.\nYet, the continued evolution of war, and therefore the military instrument of national power, has resulted in a US military that performs functions and duties that go well beyond traditional armed conflict. From nation-building, including the construction of schools and hospitals or training of judges and politicians in Afghanistan, to humanitarian assistance, disaster recovery, and agricultural development in Africa, the military is no longer a simple hammer, but has become a geopolitical multi-purpose tool.¹⁵ However, while the modern US military is capable of far more than applying conventional force in the pursuit of political objectives, this does not change the fact that it is still built primarily for war. This belligerent purpose not only influences military culture, recruitment efforts, virtues, and norms, but drives how the military trains and disciplines itself, educates its leaders, and is entirely deterministic in how it identifies, prioritizes, develops, and acquires its capabilities. War is not merely what the military plans for but shapes the very process that the military uses to plan.\nWithin game theory, a finite game is one in which either the rules of the game or the incentives of the players serve to ensure that the game ends with clear winners and losers. Since nations in an armed conflict seek or are generally incentivized to end the conflict, a declared period of war is a finite game. Geopolitical competition between the US and China, however, is an infinite game, since it is reasonable to assert that neither party is sufficiently incentivized realistically to seek a permanent and definitive culmination of the competition.¹⁶ Instead, both parties seek to establish and exploit their own competitive advantages while avoiding or negating their opponent's comparative strengths. Understanding the temporal character of both competition and conflict should inform, if not determine, the dominant strategies of the game, influencing how players think about time, resources, maneuver, and objectives. The macro trends of twenty-first century competition and conflict thus far indicate that while the nature of cyberspace provides actors with ample opportunity for influence, espionage, exploitation, and subversion, the environment is significantly less conducive to coercion than other domains.\nSPRING 2023 | 123\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nAn important implication here may be that cyberspace is better suited for the pursuit of broad objectives in an infinite game, as opposed to the narrowly defined and time-constrained objectives of a finite game.\nFor instance, Moscow's failure to meaningfully disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate its national defense through employment of cyber capabilities prior to or during Russia's invasion supports the idea that cyberspace is better postured for broad geopolitical competition objectives than discrete, narrowly tailored war objectives. Despite a decade of politicians, military leaders, academics, and pundits alike predicting a future conflict largely decided by cyber means, it does not appear that Russia mounted a consequential cyber offensive as part of its invasion. This has caused some to doubt the current or future strategic utility of cyberspace.[17] However, prudence demands caution before making definitive statements or attempting conclusions regarding Russia's failure, as both time and declassification are equally likely to disprove many seemingly factual observations. If Russia has employed cyberspace capabilities as part of its invasion of Ukraine, very few observers have the means to observe and assess their impact sufficiently, or understand the degree that commercial, state, or non-state entities aided in the defense of Ukrainian cyberspace.\nWhether Russia failed to develop, integrate, and deliver strategically consequential cyber effects, or the Microsoft, Anonymous, and NATO-supported community-based cyberspace defense efforts succeeded in neutralizing those effects, both potentialities provide logical support to the argument that cyberspace is better suited to geopolitical conflict than war. Russia has demonstrated the ability, when unconstrained by time and comparatively broad in its desired targets or effects, to shut down national electric grids as part of a broader geopolitical effort to destabilize its opponents or competitors.[18] In contrast, it appears that Russia has learned that during war—or a finite game—it needed to count on the effectiveness of specific capabilities and effects against a narrowly defined set of targets on a specific timeline. While military capabilities like tanks, bombers and aircraft carriers offer military planners the ability to predict or make realistic assumptions about the types of effects the military can deliver on a particular timeline, capabilities and vulnerabilities in cyberspace are often ephemeral, offering much less predictability or reliability over time.\nBy comparison, objectives during geopolitical competition are not as often constrained by time, do not always include narrowly defined targets, or demand discrete or tailored effects. Russia's ability to influence the 2016 US election was not only the result of years of effort, but the nature of the political objective meant that Russian actors in cyberspace had nearly unlimited targets and potential effects they could reasonably claim to be influencing the election. Additionally, as is often the case with well-conceived information operations, the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which Russia compromised the election created additional division and distrust within the electorate. Russia also had the benefit of rehearsals for its techniques, having targeted several elections in Belarus, Ukraine, and, of course, its own internal elections since 2007.[19]\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChinese IP theft via cyberspace is similarly a matter of geopolitical competition in which China, seeking to out-compete the US over time, pursues broad objectives against a diverse set of targets and effects. Washington should carefully reconsider the wisdom of leaning too heavily on its finite-game player (the military) to counter China's infinite-game strategy, while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of whether the US seeks to win, or out-compete, before establishing policies or strategies that direct how it uses national resources to play the game.\nRegardless, if deterrence—or the ability to dissuade Beijing from certain behavior because the perceived benefits do not justify the perceived costs and risks—is the objective of US policy regarding Chinese IP theft, this will require the ability to influence CCP perceptions and intention.²⁰ Targeting and influencing perception requires both capability and credibility. However, before discussing strategies for using capability and credibility to influence perception and intention, it must be understood that existing deterrence theory was developed largely to deter aggression.²¹\nWithin the context of international relations, as well as deterrence theory, aggression is most often a matter of the coercive threat or use of force between states. Yet, it is exceedingly counterproductive to limit the conversation of cyberattacks to this narrow context, not only because most attacks in cyberspace offer poor analogical parallel to the concept of force in the physical world, but also because force is not defined in the United Nations (UN) Charter. To date neither the US nor China—despite overwhelming evidence of cyberattacks that undermine their national interests and threaten the security of their critical infrastructure—has invoked the protection of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibiting the use of force. That neither state has claimed this protection supports the assertion that most cyberattacks should not be considered within the context of military force employment.\n## NO LAWS OF UNARMED CONFLICT: REVISITING OUR THEORIES, LAWS, AND CONCEPTS\nWithout international consensus characterizing the preponderance of state behavior in cyberspace as \"force,\" logic should then demand skepticism among cyber policymakers regarding the wholesale applicability, and advisability of deference to, existing theories, laws, and norms surrounding the conventional use of force to competition or conflict in cyberspace. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), for instance, is a body of international law intended to limit humanitarian impacts caused during the use of force between states. If there is no existing law or normative international agreement characterizing state cyberattacks against other states as force, what is the virtue or value of allowing restraining concepts like proportionality, distinction, or military necessity to interfere with the defense—or pursuit, for that matter—of national interests in cyberspace? Why would the US elect to conduct the cognitive gymnastics necessary to frame cyberattacks within the context of LOAC? To avoid the ire of operational law attorneys, this article will sidestep the nuances and technicalities of the legal debate by\nSPRING 2023 | 125\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nsimply asserting that LOAC is an analogically poor framework for regulating state behavior in cyberspace. While there remains insufficient international consensus to establish the type of norms needed to constrain state behavior, insistence upon applying the constraints of LOAC is diffusing US relative power and restraining US ability to deter aggression in cyberspace.\nExtant deterrence theory and policies should be viewed with similar skepticism. Classical deterrence theory, devised to disincentivize the aggressive use of force between states, may prove insufficient in deterring the unique forms of aggressive state behavior seen in cyberspace. In their book *Cross-Domain Deterrence*, Jon R. Lindsey and Erik Gartzke note that classic deterrence theory is itself a historical product of a particular technological innovation—nuclear weapons—and cast doubt on the theory's application to the emergence of new technologies.[22]\nThe unique nature of cyberspace, and the fledgling historical record of competition and conflict therein, also gives reason to question strategic assumptions regarding the propensity for escalation, both within cyberspace as well as the cross-domain variety. In *The Perfect Weapon*, David Sanger notes that one reason the US cannot figure out how to counter cyberattacks is its belief that response incurs a great risk of escalation.[23] However, hesitation by the US to respond to attacks in cyberspace over concerns of escalation is poorly founded, based more on sentiment and abstraction than historical or empirical evidence. To the contrary, two decades of state competition and conflict in cyberspace suggest that a rational actor in the current international system will not use traditional military force as a response to cyberattacks that deliver only economic or information effects. To attribute the observed lack of proliferation in kinetic effects delivered through cyberspace to some inherently deterrent influence of cyberpower itself is logically lacking, as the cyber domain in that situation becomes merely a medium for cross-domain kinetic effect.\nIt is also logically consistent that the effects of conventional deterrence would have cross-domain influence, deterring escalation from cyber effect to kinetic action both internally and externally to the cyber domain. It stands to reason that any cyberattack that delivers armed attack equivalent effects will be treated by a state no differently than conventional force employment. In such a case, the medium of delivery is logically relevant, but should be inconsequential, as there would be little rational reason for a state to treat such an attack any differently than the use of land, maritime, or air power to deliver conventional force.\nIt can also be counterproductive to constrain thinking on national cybersecurity to extant military theory or doctrine. For instance, the wisdom of Clausewitz contributes to the theoretical foundations of belligerency the assertion that between two parties with equal means, defense is not only easier than attack but is the stronger and more superior form of fighting.[24] Here it should be noted that Clausewitz differentiates between \"pure defense,\" or the act of waiting for a blow that permanently leaves the initiative with the enemy, and \"relative defense,\" which encompasses both defensive and offensive maneuver for the purpose of either attriting the enemy or deliberately manipulating time and/or space in order to negate an enemy's temporal\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nadvantage or influence the enemy's decision calculus.²⁵ Clausewitz casts pure defense aside as contrary to the very idea of war. In cyberspace pure defense—static defense measures such as firewalls, antivirus scanners, personal security products, and other automated security tools employed and monitored by system administrators and network defenders—certainly has an important place in geopolitical competition, conflict, and war.\nClausewitz’s characterization of the asymmetries of interest and the nature of interplay between the offense and defense, as well as other supporting arguments for the general superiority of the defense, also apply inconsistently to conflict in cyberspace. The unique aspects of cyberspace, including the inherent obfuscation of identity, the relative ease of concealing digital presence and activities, the lack of geographic buffers, and the compression of both time and distance, combine to provide distinct advantages to the attacker over the defender.²⁶ In an infinite game, the advantages of maneuver, objective, initiative, economy of force, unity of command, simplicity, speed, and surprise all belong to the offense.\nWhile the debate over the comparative advantages of offense or defense in cyberspace is unlikely to culminate in foreseeable future, the 21st century experience suggests that while the best defense in cyberspace might require some offensive action, deterrence in cyberspace will undoubtedly require both. Deterrence by denial—or lowering an adversary’s expectation of success—is supported through improved cybersecurity and defensive measures intended to frustrate, mitigate, or prevent cyberattacks. Yet, there are dual asymmetries to resolve in deterring IP theft through cyberspace. First, the fundamental and inherent asymmetry between the significant potential benefits and comparatively low costs and barriers to entry makes it difficult to deter IP theft exclusively through defense. This, combined with an asymmetry of vulnerability created by US commitment to open societies, capitalist market-based economies, and global interdependency, makes it unlikely that defense alone can achieve deterrence.\nThe fact that China’s IP theft occurs within an infinite game only compounds this reality. In an infinite game, the low cost of offense and significant financial and manpower costs of defense make it is unrealistic to expect defense alone to reduce state perceptions of benefit sufficiently to a level that achieves deterrence over time. While the continued maturation of security-focused network architectures such as zero-trust, as well as increased integration of automation or even artificial intelligence, may with time improve the effectiveness of defense and cybersecurity, there is little reason to doubt that offensive techniques and attack capabilities will be similarly improved in the time needed to implement these defensive measures. Yet, when reduced perception or likelihood of benefit is combined with increased perception of costs and risks, achieved through consistent and credible punishment, deterrence might be possible.\nOn top of the need to critically evaluate the applicability of existing theory, laws, and norms to cyberspace, it is prudent to reflect on US cyber policy, as the credibility of US national response to Chinese IP theft has been constrained by a variety of policy and bureaucratic\nSPRING 2023 | 127\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nlimitations across presidential administrations.27 One such constraining influence is America's strategic culture, which is the idea that deeply rooted cultural preferences exert influence on strategic choices, and that a nation's security history imposes a certain inertia on the decisions of the state in a way that can make strategy less responsive to modern evolutions in the character of competition and conflict.28 In cyberspace, an artifact of the multi-decade Cold War is that the US maintains a significant strategic preference for intelligence over effects. Since 2011, options for decisive offensive cyber operations in response to cyberattacks have been presented regularly to national leadership. A common objection to offensive operations, often coming from the U.S. Intelligence Community, is that offensive action poses risk to intelligence collection capabilities while delivering only a limited or short-lived benefit.29 However, consistent deference to this view has destroyed Washington's ability to establish the credibility needed to deter cyber aggression. The predictability of the US strategic preference for economic stability, diplomatic influence, and intelligence collection over deterrence in cyberspace inexorably undermines its own credibility.\nWhile strategic culture is certainly an obstacle, the challenge of attribution also constrains US thinking and consistency of action in cyberspace.30 Cyber attribution, the process of identifying and laying blame on the actor of a cyberattack, is strained by many unique aspects of cyberspace itself. The logical rules that govern how networked devices communicate serve to obfuscate identity in a way that is understandably confusing to a lawyer or a politician, but much less so to a trained cyber professional. The challenge of convincing non-technical policy and decision-makers of the significance and accuracy of cyber forensics evidence has certainly contributed to a decade of failure deterring aggression in cyberspace. The US must mature not only its understanding of attribution, but its willingness to act in situations of attributional uncertainty, if the nation is to achieve the consistency of action needed for deterrence.\nThere are five “elements” of attributing action in cyberspace, including persona, geopolitical, geographic, logical, and physical layers. Each element can be independently and definitively determined through advanced cyber forensics. An in-depth articulation of the nuances of each element is not needed to understand the greater point: the US should reject the thinking that all five elements of attribution must be satisfied to justify action in response to cyberattacks. Currently, US decision-makers are holding attribution for actions in cyberspace to an unnecessarily high standard when each singular element of attribution offers a unique objective justification for a wide variety of potential national response actions. In other domains, decisions regarding US military action are often made based on comprehensive, multi-factor intelligence assessments. The same type of assessment is possible in cyberspace.\n## ADDRESSING THE CONSTRAINTS OF ATTRIBUTION\nA multi-factor cyberspace attribution assessment would combine cyber forensics evidence with an analysis of the historical records of cyberattacks, economic and geopolitical\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nmotivations, as well as signals and human intelligence, to enable analysts to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive, contextually informed confidence assessment. This framework would deliberately allow for some subjectivity, including an assessment of whether a cyberattack is consistent with enemy state interests, previously attributed cyberattacks, or known state cyber capabilities and signatures. Combining objective forensics evidence with subjective intelligence analysis should serve to improve the comfort level of decision-makers in approving and directing timely and decisive action in response to cyberattacks.\nThe US cyber response playbook should include the widest possible variety of punitive and responsive legal, diplomatic, informational, economic, and military actions. Such actions should include international or domestic indictment, as well as the colloquial \"name and shame\" brand of embarrassing public statements and condemnation. In 2015, President Obama demonstrated that the evidence of cyberattacks can be used quite effectively as leverage during diplomatic or trade negotiations.[31] The US should also expand its use of economic punishment measures to target the material interests of not only national governments, but also private commercial entities that enable enemy cyberattacks. In addition, of course, the US can use overt, covert, or clandestine offensive cyberspace operations for a wide variety of deliberate effects. Each of these potential responses receives a unique degree of logical support from the individual elements of attribution.\nFor example, consider a cyberattack in which the US can definitively identify the physical devices used during an attack, as well as the geographic location—in, such as China—of the equipment during the attack. Without the ability to attribute the persona element or geopolitical association (individual hacktivist versus government-sanctioned operative) of the attacker, it is perfectly reasonable to take certain playbook options, like indictment, off the table. However, given the location of the attack origin, this partial attribution offers at least some value as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, while actions targeting the device(s) or the material interests of any identified enablers would also be justified. For the sake of contrast, in the less common scenario in which the identity and geopolitical association of an attacker can be attributed, the entire playbook should be viewed as available, with or without definitive attribution of the physical or logical layers of the equipment used during the attack.\nYet, obfuscation of identity is only one way that the challenge of attribution strains a state's ability to deter aggression in cyberspace. Not only is it possible for a skilled cyber actor to obfuscate or destroy digital evidence of their presence and actions, but attributional efforts are further frustrated by the pace of technological change, the inherent and real-time customizability of cyberspace capabilities, and the omnipresent need for secrecy to protect both capabilities and a state's awareness of adversary vulnerabilities. The consequence here is that attributing action in cyberspace will, for the foreseeable future, undermine the type of timely, transactional, and associative punitive response needed to sufficiently signal to adversaries a correlation between cause and effect.\nSPRING 2023 | 129\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThis inescapable delay between cyberattack and punishment poses a serious problem within the cognitive confines of classical deterrence theory, as a state that intends to signal or deliver punishment for undesirable behavior needs to do so in a timely and associative manner. With the nature of cyberspace naturally complicating timely response, perhaps deterrence in cyberspace demands that states evolve thinking beyond transactional tit-for-tat responses to seemingly isolated incidents of cyberattacks, and instead respond comprehensively to the collective and cumulative impacts of an adversary's actions to the state's national interests.\nLucas Kello, the director of the Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, expands upon this idea in his 2021 article in the Journal of Cybersecurity: \"Cyber Legalism: why it fails and what to do about it.\" In the article, Kello articulates four principles that should inform better doctrine for cyber conflict. His first principle, the \"accretional principle,\" suggests that states should treat attacks as strategic campaigns, not individual actions.[32] If cyberattacks were punished cumulatively, it would allow a state to target the psychological component of adversarial decision making without the constraints of time, possibly even reducing the burden of attribution through aggregation. Similar to the Clausewitzian notion of relative defense, a strategy that observes the accretional principle would allow the victim of cyberattacks to maintain initiative by delivering penalties in a concentrated fashion and controlling key conditions of the interaction—namely time and location. This effectively enables the defender to determine, and when desirable obfuscate, the threshold of aggregate harm that triggers punishment. The \"many possible permutations of punishable actions and their attendant penalties give the defender a wide scope of maneuver,\" introducing the type of uncertainty that should complicate an adversary's risk-benefit analysis. Well-executed, the ability to deliberately create uncertainty could reasonably cause an adversary to guess conservatively about the location of the line of response, delivering a deterrent effect on the utilization of cyberattack.[33]\n# OBSTACLES AND IMPEDIMENTS: COMPETING INTERESTS AND POOR NATIONAL UNITY OF EFFORT\nIf deterrence demands both capability and credibility, then why has deterrence failed in cyberspace? While the US is the \"world's stealthiest, most skilled cyber power,\"[34] since 2006, it has also been the target of more significant cyberattacks than the next seven countries combined.[35] Despite possessing tremendous cyber capabilities and capacity—military and commercial alike—the US is not feared in cyberspace.[36] While this observation demands a theory-based articulation of whether the nature of cyberspace complicates or precludes coercion, such an endeavor is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, it is enough to simply observe that while China is undoubtedly aware of US cyber capabilities, it is increasingly convinced of Washington's lack of resolve to use those capabilities to punish its behavior.[37] However, even if the US can broaden its view of cyberspace, resolve the limitations of its strategic culture, expand its view of attribution, and deliver a strategy that increases its willingness to act, certain obstacles and impediments still weaken the foundations of US deterrent potential in cyberspace.\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nOne such impediment is the lack of trust, communication, collaboration, and cooperation between the government and the private sector. When Google executives were notified in 2009 that the Chinese had compromised their systems, they waited nearly a year to acknowledge the attack publicly. Moreover, Google did not reveal the full extent of the exposure; a server used to store court orders from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had also been compromised. Google's response was not unusual—when targeted by a cyberattack, most American corporations turn to private cybersecurity firms, and are hesitant to work with the US government due to concerns over what federal investigators might find in their computer systems.38 This hesitation to cooperate is based on a lack of trust, which is a natural consequence of competing interests. The private sector fears that the government will pursue its other interests, namely law enforcement, while casting aside corporate concerns over publicity or economic ramifications whenever such interests impede investigation.\nWhile progress on this front may already be underway, there is still much work to be done. In 2018, the US created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a subordinate agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Agency seeks to work across public and private sectors, challenging traditional ways of doing business by engaging with government, industry, academic, and international partners.39 This type of work should posture CISA to pursue the kind of “civilian military government (CMG) integration” needed to incentivize collaboration and cooperation between the public and private sectors. What is missing is transparency and clarity regarding the nature of CISA's relationship with the Intelligence Community (IC), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\nTo partially mitigate the concerns of the private sector, the US government must pass legislation prohibiting CISA from collecting or storing privately owned data found during its cybersecurity response, operations, or forensics investigation activities, while also requiring corporate anonymization in threat reporting to protect corporate interests. Legislation must also clarify that CISA has no investigatory authorities with respect to domestic laws and prohibit any cooperation or communication with the FBI that does not directly advance collective national cybersecurity. Such measures would improve the private sector's perception of this new organization by demonstrating that CISA is capable of, and committed to, pursuing cybersecurity separate from other government functions, helping to establish trust and encourage national collaboration and cooperation unfettered by competing interests.\nAchieving CMG integration would significantly improve two additional challenges that the nation faces in the pursuit of national cybersecurity: a lack of shared understanding of cyber threats and poor unity of effort toward the common interests of cybersecurity. Currently, if thought of as a collective entity, the national “cyber talent pool” is highly fractured and disconnected. Large telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Comcast have very talented infrastructure managers. Silicon Valley attracts software engineering experts. Norton and FireEye target cyber forensics and reverse engineering specialists. There is a large community\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nof independent penetration testers and certified ethical hackers throughout the country. The National Security Agency offers its civil servants the opportunity to specialize in cryptography, code breaking, or intelligence work, and those drawn to the uniform can pursue each of these specialties, and more, by service in one of the uniformed services, and through them the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). However, the tremendous economic incentives of the US private sector make it difficult, if not entirely unrealistic, for the government to recruit and retain the nation's top cyberspace talent. CMG integration may offer an opportunity to partially address this challenge.\nFor well over a decade, there has been an ongoing debate in the US regarding the ethical and security ramifications of allowing the victims of cyberattacks to \"hack-back.\" The idea is poorly received by many, often citing concerns over escalation to war. However, it is nothing short of injustice for the government to acknowledge that it does not have the authorities or capacity to defend private commercial interests, while also constraining the response options of commercial victims of cyberattacks.[40] The fundamental implication of the \"defend forward\" element of the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy is that defending US government networks, critical infrastructure, and key resources requires a willingness and ability to regularly operate beyond US networks in order to disrupt, degrade, or deny adversary offensive capabilities before they reach America's digital shores. It is a phenomenal policy that has clearly improved USCYBERCOM's ability to identify, neutralize, or exploit threats to US government networks. However, the strategy also exposes an injustice, as US law and policy preclude Silicon Valley from taking similar measures, when necessary, to defend its own networks or commercial interests. China does not observe the US delineation between private or public, only national interests. While the US government's position is that the private sector should invest appropriately to defend its networks, defense is clearly not enough.\nSetting aside abstract principled objections, or even existing US or international law, the reality is that restricting the private sector's immense cyber talent from taking the necessary actions to defend US economic interests in cyberspace undermines both collective cybersecurity and deterrence. To marginalize the technical talent of the private sector operationally is akin to a football team that keeps its star players on the bench. If the US thought of cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition, and not merely a domain of military or government conflict, it would not hesitate to fully leverage the best talent available to win the game. Since such a fundamental change to how the US thinks and operates in cyberspace seems unlikely in the near term, improving CMG integration might offer a meaningful compromise.\nOnce CISA establishes a collaborative cybersecurity community that improves the national sight picture of cyber threats, it could assume an additional role by giving the private sector a central point of contact for requesting offensive action in response to foreign cyber aggression against its corporate or economic interests. CISA would then coordinate with the appropriate agency to seek approval of the operation, affording the aggrieved company the opportunity\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nto provide relevant information, and possibly even offer materiel or technical support, toward achieving responsive remedial—and ideally deterrent—action. Imagine, for a moment, Silicon Valley engineers collaborating with the offensive teams of USCYBERCOM to execute timely action in response to China's cyber aggression. This future operation would have better access to both threat intelligence and cyber talent than the current siloed model, with improved capability and credibility—and trust—setting a more solid foundation for deterrence.\n# CONCLUSION\nChina is very effectively using cyberspace to marginalize whatever relative power advantage the US might possess, and this has Beijing on a strategic azimuth to surpass Washington in terms of relative power. Despite possessing more capacity and capability than any nation in the world, the US has been unable to leverage its national abilities to deter undesirable Chinese behavior in cyberspace.^[41]^ This inability to achieve consensus reflects the fact that the US attempts to understand cyberspace largely through analogical reasoning, seeking conceptual understanding through the lens of existing phenomena like war or domestic and international law. This is a fundamentally flawed and limited approach that will continue to contribute to constrained thinking and national policy. Thucydides never would have imagined a world where the strong suffer what they must, while the weak do what they can. By broadening its view of cyberspace, resolving the constraints of its own theories, policies and thinking, and improving private and public sector cooperation, the US can build a better foundation from which to take the type of consistent and credible action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.^[42]^\n# DISCLAIMER\nThe views expressed in this work are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of the United States Military Academy, the Department of the Army, or the Department of Defense.\nSPRING 2023 | 133\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE"

Despite the clear threat, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of cyberspace, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and conceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over other competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.\nWhen Thucydides wrote of envisioned dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, in 400 B.C, one cannot help but wonder whether he knew his words would influence thinking on power and conflict for centuries. A single quote from this Athenian general can be claimed the very progenitor of international relations theory: \"The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\"¹ This anarchic nature of the international political system creates an inherent danger and drives states to concern themselves primarily with power and security.² While the realities of the 21st century have not changed this natural tension between states, they have changed the tactics and strategies states employ. Between great powers, nuclear weapons offer no realistic positive political objective, and the utility of traditional military force has been reduced due to the perceived risk of escalation\nThis is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

Cyberspace has catalyzed and accelerated this type of competition. China has adapted to this reality faster than the United States (US), stealing trillions of dollars in intellectual property (IP) from America's commercial industries and research and development (R&amp;D) from its defense industrial base.⁴ Despite this demonstrated and significant threat to its relative power, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of the cyberspace domain, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and ceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter Chinese aggression in cyberspace.\n## THE CHINA THREAT\nBefore discussing the nuances of deterrence, cyberspace, or deterrence in cyberspace, it is prudent to clearly articulate the behavior to be deterred. Certainly, any deterrence strategy should account for the unique motives, costs, and risks of specific undesirable adversary behavior. For example, Russian state-led efforts to destabilize US institutions and manipulate the electorate involve benefits, costs, and risks that are distinct in scope, scale, and influence when compared to a non-state actor's relatively simplistic employment of ransomware to obtain economic resources. To influence an adversary's decision calculus and deter undesirable behavior, deterrence strategies should be deliberately catered to these unique considerations. The question is, then: Of the myriad ways China uses cyberspace in the pursuit of its national interests, what specific behavior should the US seek to deter?\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChina's laws, policies, and actions indicate three overarching priorities in cyberspace: domestic control and regime stability, espionage, and access to technology.⁵ The worldwide expansion of the Internet toward the end of the 20ᵗʰ century was largely shaped by the West. The thinking amongst the technological elite was that expanded connectivity, access to information, and unrestricted digital speech would have a liberalizing influence on the world, tempering and marginalizing authoritarian rule. Unfortunately, China quickly recognized the Internet's potential for unregulated free speech and uncontrolled proliferation of information, which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as existential threats to party security, control, and legitimacy.⁶ In response, by implementing measures such as the \"Great Firewall,\" as well as state-leveraged intermediary liability and a state-controlled information technology industry, the CCP has managed to turn the Internet into a massive tool of domestic surveillance and censorship.⁷ While this state behavior is at odds with the values of American democratic society, it should not be the primary focus of deterrence.\nChina's second priority in cyberspace, espionage, is complicated by matters of moral authority and legitimacy. The US, having significantly shaped and influenced the current rules-based international order, is committed to the norms and laws of the system and seeks to maintain international support through action that is consistent with its principles. James Clapper, then Director of National Intelligence, stated in 2015 that in cyberspace \"there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack.\"⁸ This recognition that the US conducts cyber espionage tacitly acknowledges the legitimacy of espionage in cyberspace. It also tangentially supports both the idea that espionage is a sovereign right and the belief that espionage has a fundamentally stabilizing influence in the international system, as improved awareness of adversary capabilities can temper expectations of benefit from the use of force. While the US should expect states to continue cyber espionage, a policy of deterrence would be manifest hypocrisy.\nWe then consider China's third priority in cyberspace—access to technology. China has demonstrated an extensive willingness and ability to exploit and access public and private networks worldwide in the pursuit of information and IP, particularly defense-related or technologically innovative R&amp;D.⁹ China's IP theft should not be dismissed as merely a private sector or economic concern. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center emphasizes this in its 2018 annual report, depicting foreign economic and industrial espionage as a significant threat to US prosperity, security, and competitive advantage.¹⁰ China's ability to reap the benefit of massive American investments in military and commercial R&amp;D diffuses US relative power within the international system. It also allows China to negate one of the most consequential competitive advantages of America's democratic, capitalist system over China's authoritarian, state-planned economy—the innovative forces of economic incentive in an open-market system.¹¹\nSPRING 2023 | 121\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe US has been slow to realize, and slower still to respond to, the gravity of the threat posed by China's theft of IP. The speed and operational tradecraft, as well as the breadth and diversity of targets involved, strain Washington's ability to appreciate the scope and scale of the collective impact to US national interests. For the sake of comparison, the military is quite proficient at contextualizing the direct, tangible threat that adversary military forces pose to national security. Weapon system ranges, hypersonic weapon speeds, operational reach, and force projection are all relatively easily understood and measured concepts that translate well to traditional conceptualizations of threats to national security. What is more difficult to measure, and thereby contextualize in degree and severity of vulnerability and effect, is the cumulative impact of comparatively abstract grey zone threats and attacks that target the intersection of security and other national interests.\nFor example, Russian social media disinformation and misinformation efforts target a state's national psyche, polarizing the electorate and undermining a democratic state's ability to achieve political and social consensus by exploiting the seams among freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and national security. Chinese IP theft exploits a different vulnerability: the seams among national security, commercial enterprise, and economic prosperity. When adversaries target these seams, they create not only uncertainty about the extent of what is happening but also an inability or unwillingness to coordinate and execute the type of assertive, credible, associative, and timely national response needed to achieve deterrence. Yet, purely with respect to economic prosperity and relative power, the collective costs of cyberattacks may very well compete with or outweigh the net costs of any war in US history.\n# CYBERSPACE: UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON\nTo improve the conceptual foundations needed to deliver policies and strategies that could realistically create the conditions needed for deterrence, the US must first expand how it views the phenomenon of cyberspace. Throughout much of the 21st century, the government and military communities debated the question of whether or not cyberspace is a domain of warfare, equal in status and warfighting significance to the maritime, land, air, and space domains. This particular question appears to be at least partially resolved, with the military's position apparent in its definition of \"cyberspace\" in Joint Publication 3-12: \"the domain [emphasis added] within the information environment that consists of the interdependent network of information technology (IT) infrastructures and resident data.\"\nA myopic focus on the military aspects of cyberspace is insufficient for the US to pursue and defend its national interests. While cyberspace certainly creates opportunities and vulnerabilities during war, it also offers US enemies a low-cost opportunity to pursue their strategic interests during peace, entirely negating the coercive and deterrent influences of US economic and military might. This ability of a state or an individual actor to pursue their interests through cyberspace, unthreatened and unimpeded by any relative power asymmetries that\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nexist, suggests that the environment should not be thought of as the \"fourth military offset,\" but as an international relations offset.¹⁴ The figure below depicts cyberspace not merely as a military domain, but a broad spectrum, while also highlighting the relatively small portion of cyberspace where the military primarily operates.\n|  Competition |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | Conflict  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Social Functions |   | Economic Functions |   |   | Government Functions  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Medical | Academia | Media | Commercial | Industrial | Law Enforcement | Homeland Security | Foreign | Military |   |\nFigure 1: Cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition and conflict.\nCyberspace is not a domain where national business is conducted, and national interests are pursued in isolated silos. Instead, the US must view cyberspace as a broad and interconnected spectrum that supports and enables the sources and instruments of national power across the entire continuum of competition to conflict on a geopolitical—not just a military—battlefield.\nYet, the continued evolution of war, and therefore the military instrument of national power, has resulted in a US military that performs functions and duties that go well beyond traditional armed conflict. From nation-building, including the construction of schools and hospitals or training of judges and politicians in Afghanistan, to humanitarian assistance, disaster recovery, and agricultural development in Africa, the military is no longer a simple hammer, but has become a geopolitical multi-purpose tool.¹⁵ However, while the modern US military is capable of far more than applying conventional force in the pursuit of political objectives, this does not change the fact that it is still built primarily for war. This belligerent purpose not only influences military culture, recruitment efforts, virtues, and norms, but drives how the military trains and disciplines itself, educates its leaders, and is entirely deterministic in how it identifies, prioritizes, develops, and acquires its capabilities. War is not merely what the military plans for but shapes the very process that the military uses to plan.\nWithin game theory, a finite game is one in which either the rules of the game or the incentives of the players serve to ensure that the game ends with clear winners and losers. Since nations in an armed conflict seek or are generally incentivized to end the conflict, a declared period of war is a finite game. Geopolitical competition between the US and China, however, is an infinite game, since it is reasonable to assert that neither party is sufficiently incentivized realistically to seek a permanent and definitive culmination of the competition.¹⁶ Instead, both parties seek to establish and exploit their own competitive advantages while avoiding or negating their opponent's comparative strengths. Understanding the temporal character of both competition and conflict should inform, if not determine, the dominant strategies of the game, influencing how players think about time, resources, maneuver, and objectives. The macro trends of twenty-first century competition and conflict thus far indicate that while the nature of cyberspace provides actors with ample opportunity for influence, espionage, exploitation, and subversion, the environment is significantly less conducive to coercion than other domains.\nSPRING 2023 | 123\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nAn important implication here may be that cyberspace is better suited for the pursuit of broad objectives in an infinite game, as opposed to the narrowly defined and time-constrained objectives of a finite game.\nFor instance, Moscow's failure to meaningfully disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate its national defense through employment of cyber capabilities prior to or during Russia's invasion supports the idea that cyberspace is better postured for broad geopolitical competition objectives than discrete, narrowly tailored war objectives. Despite a decade of politicians, military leaders, academics, and pundits alike predicting a future conflict largely decided by cyber means, it does not appear that Russia mounted a consequential cyber offensive as part of its invasion. This has caused some to doubt the current or future strategic utility of cyberspace. However, prudence demands caution before making definitive statements or attempting conclusions regarding Russia's failure, as both time and declassification are equally likely to disprove many seemingly factual observations. If Russia has employed cyberspace capabilities as part of its invasion of Ukraine, very few observers have the means to observe and assess their impact sufficiently, or understand the degree that commercial, state, or non-state entities aided in the defense of Ukrainian cyberspace.\nWhether Russia failed to develop, integrate, and deliver strategically consequential cyber effects, or the Microsoft, Anonymous, and NATO-supported community-based cyberspace defense efforts succeeded in neutralizing those effects, both potentialities provide logical support to the argument that cyberspace is better suited to geopolitical conflict than war. Russia has demonstrated the ability, when unconstrained by time and comparatively broad in its desired targets or effects, to shut down national electric grids as part of a broader geopolitical effort to destabilize its opponents or competitors. In contrast, it appears that Russia has learned that during war—or a finite game—it needed to count on the effectiveness of specific capabilities and effects against a narrowly defined set of targets on a specific timeline. While military capabilities like tanks, bombers and aircraft carriers offer military planners the ability to predict or make realistic assumptions about the types of effects the military can deliver on a particular timeline, capabilities and vulnerabilities in cyberspace are often ephemeral, offering much less predictability or reliability over time.\nBy comparison, objectives during geopolitical competition are not as often constrained by time, do not always include narrowly defined targets, or demand discrete or tailored effects. Russia's ability to influence the 2016 US election was not only the result of years of effort, but the nature of the political objective meant that Russian actors in cyberspace had nearly unlimited targets and potential effects they could reasonably claim to be influencing the election. Additionally, as is often the case with well-conceived information operations, the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which Russia compromised the election created additional division and distrust within the electorate. Russia also had the benefit of rehearsals for its techniques, having targeted several elections in Belarus, Ukraine, and, of course, its own internal elections since 2007.\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChinese IP theft via cyberspace is similarly a matter of geopolitical competition in which China, seeking to out-compete the US over time, pursues broad objectives against a diverse set of targets and effects. Washington should carefully reconsider the wisdom of leaning too heavily on its finite-game player (the military) to counter China's infinite-game strategy, while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of whether the US seeks to win, or out-compete, before establishing policies or strategies that direct how it uses national resources to play the game.\nRegardless, if deterrence—or the ability to dissuade Beijing from certain behavior because the perceived benefits do not justify the perceived costs and risks—is the objective of US policy regarding Chinese IP theft, this will require the ability to influence CCP perceptions and intention.²⁰ Targeting and influencing perception requires both capability and credibility. However, before discussing strategies for using capability and credibility to influence perception and intention, it must be understood that existing deterrence theory was developed largely to deter aggression.²¹\nWithin the context of international relations, as well as deterrence theory, aggression is most often a matter of the coercive threat or use of force between states. Yet, it is exceedingly counterproductive to limit the conversation of cyberattacks to this narrow context, not only because most attacks in cyberspace offer poor analogical parallel to the concept of force in the physical world, but also because force is not defined in the United Nations (UN) Charter. To date neither the US nor China—despite overwhelming evidence of cyberattacks that undermine their national interests and threaten the security of their critical infrastructure—has invoked the protection of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibiting the use of force. That neither state has claimed this protection supports the assertion that most cyberattacks should not be considered within the context of military force employment.\n## NO LAWS OF UNARMED CONFLICT: REVISITING OUR THEORIES, LAWS, AND CONCEPTS\nWithout international consensus characterizing the preponderance of state behavior in cyberspace as \"force,\" logic should then demand skepticism among cyber policymakers regarding the wholesale applicability, and advisability of deference to, existing theories, laws, and norms surrounding the conventional use of force to competition or conflict in cyberspace. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), for instance, is a body of international law intended to limit humanitarian impacts caused during the use of force between states. If there is no existing law or normative international agreement characterizing state cyberattacks against other states as force, what is the virtue or value of allowing restraining concepts like proportionality, distinction, or military necessity to interfere with the defense—or pursuit, for that matter—of national interests in cyberspace? Why would the US elect to conduct the cognitive gymnastics necessary to frame cyberattacks within the context of LOAC? To avoid the ire of operational law attorneys, this article will sidestep the nuances and technicalities of the legal debate by\nSPRING 2023 | 125\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nsimply asserting that LOAC is an analogically poor framework for regulating state behavior in cyberspace. While there remains insufficient international consensus to establish the type of norms needed to constrain state behavior, insistence upon applying the constraints of LOAC is diffusing US relative power and restraining US ability to deter aggression in cyberspace.\nExtant deterrence theory and policies should be viewed with similar skepticism. Classical deterrence theory, devised to disincentivize the aggressive use of force between states, may prove insufficient in deterring the unique forms of aggressive state behavior seen in cyberspace. In their book *Cross-Domain Deterrence*, Jon R. Lindsey and Erik Gartzke note that classic deterrence theory is itself a historical product of a particular technological innovation—nuclear weapons—and cast doubt on the theory's application to the emergence of new technologies.\nThe unique nature of cyberspace, and the fledgling historical record of competition and conflict therein, also gives reason to question strategic assumptions regarding the propensity for escalation, both within cyberspace as well as the cross-domain variety. In *The Perfect Weapon*, David Sanger notes that one reason the US cannot figure out how to counter cyberattacks is its belief that response incurs a great risk of escalation. However, hesitation by the US to respond to attacks in cyberspace over concerns of escalation is poorly founded, based more on sentiment and abstraction than historical or empirical evidence. To the contrary, two decades of state competition and conflict in cyberspace suggest that a rational actor in the current international system will not use traditional military force as a response to cyberattacks that deliver only economic or information effects. To attribute the observed lack of proliferation in kinetic effects delivered through cyberspace to some inherently deterrent influence of cyberpower itself is logically lacking, as the cyber domain in that situation becomes merely a medium for cross-domain kinetic effect.\nIt is also logically consistent that the effects of conventional deterrence would have cross-domain influence, deterring escalation from cyber effect to kinetic action both internally and externally to the cyber domain. It stands to reason that any cyberattack that delivers armed attack equivalent effects will be treated by a state no differently than conventional force employment. In such a case, the medium of delivery is logically relevant, but should be inconsequential, as there would be little rational reason for a state to treat such an attack any differently than the use of land, maritime, or air power to deliver conventional force.\nIt can also be counterproductive to constrain thinking on national cybersecurity to extant military theory or doctrine. For instance, the wisdom of Clausewitz contributes to the theoretical foundations of belligerency the assertion that between two parties with equal means, defense is not only easier than attack but is the stronger and more superior form of fighting. Here it should be noted that Clausewitz differentiates between \"pure defense,\" or the act of waiting for a blow that permanently leaves the initiative with the enemy, and \"relative defense,\" which encompasses both defensive and offensive maneuver for the purpose of either attriting the enemy or deliberately manipulating time and/or space in order to negate an enemy's temporal\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nadvantage or influence the enemy's decision calculus.²⁵ Clausewitz casts pure defense aside as contrary to the very idea of war. In cyberspace pure defense—static defense measures such as firewalls, antivirus scanners, personal security products, and other automated security tools employed and monitored by system administrators and network defenders—certainly has an important place in geopolitical competition, conflict, and war.\nClausewitz’s characterization of the asymmetries of interest and the nature of interplay between the offense and defense, as well as other supporting arguments for the general superiority of the defense, also apply inconsistently to conflict in cyberspace. The unique aspects of cyberspace, including the inherent obfuscation of identity, the relative ease of concealing digital presence and activities, the lack of geographic buffers, and the compression of both time and distance, combine to provide distinct advantages to the attacker over the defender.²⁶ In an infinite game, the advantages of maneuver, objective, initiative, economy of force, unity of command, simplicity, speed, and surprise all belong to the offense.\nWhile the debate over the comparative advantages of offense or defense in cyberspace is unlikely to culminate in foreseeable future, the 21st century experience suggests that while the best defense in cyberspace might require some offensive action, deterrence in cyberspace will undoubtedly require both. Deterrence by denial—or lowering an adversary’s expectation of success—is supported through improved cybersecurity and defensive measures intended to frustrate, mitigate, or prevent cyberattacks. Yet, there are dual asymmetries to resolve in deterring IP theft through cyberspace. First, the fundamental and inherent asymmetry between the significant potential benefits and comparatively low costs and barriers to entry makes it difficult to deter IP theft exclusively through defense. This, combined with an asymmetry of vulnerability created by US commitment to open societies, capitalist market-based economies, and global interdependency, makes it unlikely that defense alone can achieve deterrence.\nThe fact that China’s IP theft occurs within an infinite game only compounds this reality. In an infinite game, the low cost of offense and significant financial and manpower costs of defense make it is unrealistic to expect defense alone to reduce state perceptions of benefit sufficiently to a level that achieves deterrence over time. While the continued maturation of security-focused network architectures such as zero-trust, as well as increased integration of automation or even artificial intelligence, may with time improve the effectiveness of defense and cybersecurity, there is little reason to doubt that offensive techniques and attack capabilities will be similarly improved in the time needed to implement these defensive measures. Yet, when reduced perception or likelihood of benefit is combined with increased perception of costs and risks, achieved through consistent and credible punishment, deterrence might be possible.\nOn top of the need to critically evaluate the applicability of existing theory, laws, and norms to cyberspace, it is prudent to reflect on US cyber policy, as the credibility of US national response to Chinese IP theft has been constrained by a variety of policy and bureaucratic\nSPRING 2023 | 127\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nlimitations across presidential administrations.27 One such constraining influence is America's strategic culture, which is the idea that deeply rooted cultural preferences exert influence on strategic choices, and that a nation's security history imposes a certain inertia on the decisions of the state in a way that can make strategy less responsive to modern evolutions in the character of competition and conflict.28 In cyberspace, an artifact of the multi-decade Cold War is that the US maintains a significant strategic preference for intelligence over effects. Since 2011, options for decisive offensive cyber operations in response to cyberattacks have been presented regularly to national leadership. A common objection to offensive operations, often coming from the U.S. Intelligence Community, is that offensive action poses risk to intelligence collection capabilities while delivering only a limited or short-lived benefit.29 However, consistent deference to this view has destroyed Washington's ability to establish the credibility needed to deter cyber aggression. The predictability of the US strategic preference for economic stability, diplomatic influence, and intelligence collection over deterrence in cyberspace inexorably undermines its own credibility.\nWhile strategic culture is certainly an obstacle, the challenge of attribution also constrains US thinking and consistency of action in cyberspace.30 Cyber attribution, the process of identifying and laying blame on the actor of a cyberattack, is strained by many unique aspects of cyberspace itself. The logical rules that govern how networked devices communicate serve to obfuscate identity in a way that is understandably confusing to a lawyer or a politician, but much less so to a trained cyber professional. The challenge of convincing non-technical policy and decision-makers of the significance and accuracy of cyber forensics evidence has certainly contributed to a decade of failure deterring aggression in cyberspace. The US must mature not only its understanding of attribution, but its willingness to act in situations of attributional uncertainty, if the nation is to achieve the consistency of action needed for deterrence.\nThere are five “elements” of attributing action in cyberspace, including persona, geopolitical, geographic, logical, and physical layers. Each element can be independently and definitively determined through advanced cyber forensics. An in-depth articulation of the nuances of each element is not needed to understand the greater point: the US should reject the thinking that all five elements of attribution must be satisfied to justify action in response to cyberattacks. Currently, US decision-makers are holding attribution for actions in cyberspace to an unnecessarily high standard when each singular element of attribution offers a unique objective justification for a wide variety of potential national response actions. In other domains, decisions regarding US military action are often made based on comprehensive, multi-factor intelligence assessments. The same type of assessment is possible in cyberspace.\n## ADDRESSING THE CONSTRAINTS OF ATTRIBUTION\nA multi-factor cyberspace attribution assessment would combine cyber forensics evidence with an analysis of the historical records of cyberattacks, economic and geopolitical\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nmotivations, as well as signals and human intelligence, to enable analysts to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive, contextually informed confidence assessment. This framework would deliberately allow for some subjectivity, including an assessment of whether a cyberattack is consistent with enemy state interests, previously attributed cyberattacks, or known state cyber capabilities and signatures. Combining objective forensics evidence with subjective intelligence analysis should serve to improve the comfort level of decision-makers in approving and directing timely and decisive action in response to cyberattacks.\nThe US cyber response playbook should include the widest possible variety of punitive and responsive legal, diplomatic, informational, economic, and military actions. Such actions should include international or domestic indictment, as well as the colloquial \"name and shame\" brand of embarrassing public statements and condemnation. In 2015, President Obama demonstrated that the evidence of cyberattacks can be used quite effectively as leverage during diplomatic or trade negotiations. The US should also expand its use of economic punishment measures to target the material interests of not only national governments, but also private commercial entities that enable enemy cyberattacks. In addition, of course, the US can use overt, covert, or clandestine offensive cyberspace operations for a wide variety of deliberate effects. Each of these potential responses receives a unique degree of logical support from the individual elements of attribution.\nFor example, consider a cyberattack in which the US can definitively identify the physical devices used during an attack, as well as the geographic location—in, such as China—of the equipment during the attack. Without the ability to attribute the persona element or geopolitical association (individual hacktivist versus government-sanctioned operative) of the attacker, it is perfectly reasonable to take certain playbook options, like indictment, off the table. However, given the location of the attack origin, this partial attribution offers at least some value as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, while actions targeting the device(s) or the material interests of any identified enablers would also be justified. For the sake of contrast, in the less common scenario in which the identity and geopolitical association of an attacker can be attributed, the entire playbook should be viewed as available, with or without definitive attribution of the physical or logical layers of the equipment used during the attack.\nYet, obfuscation of identity is only one way that the challenge of attribution strains a state's ability to deter aggression in cyberspace. Not only is it possible for a skilled cyber actor to obfuscate or destroy digital evidence of their presence and actions, but attributional efforts are further frustrated by the pace of technological change, the inherent and real-time customizability of cyberspace capabilities, and the omnipresent need for secrecy to protect both capabilities and a state's awareness of adversary vulnerabilities. The consequence here is that attributing action in cyberspace will, for the foreseeable future, undermine the type of timely, transactional, and associative punitive response needed to sufficiently signal to adversaries a correlation between cause and effect.\nSPRING 2023 | 129\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThis inescapable delay between cyberattack and punishment poses a serious problem within the cognitive confines of classical deterrence theory, as a state that intends to signal or deliver punishment for undesirable behavior needs to do so in a timely and associative manner. With the nature of cyberspace naturally complicating timely response, perhaps deterrence in cyberspace demands that states evolve thinking beyond transactional tit-for-tat responses to seemingly isolated incidents of cyberattacks, and instead respond comprehensively to the collective and cumulative impacts of an adversary's actions to the state's national interests.\nLucas Kello, the director of the Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, expands upon this idea in his 2021 article in the Journal of Cybersecurity: \"Cyber Legalism: why it fails and what to do about it.\" In the article, Kello articulates four principles that should inform better doctrine for cyber conflict. His first principle, the \"accretional principle,\" suggests that states should treat attacks as strategic campaigns, not individual actions. If cyberattacks were punished cumulatively, it would allow a state to target the psychological component of adversarial decision making without the constraints of time, possibly even reducing the burden of attribution through aggregation. Similar to the Clausewitzian notion of relative defense, a strategy that observes the accretional principle would allow the victim of cyberattacks to maintain initiative by delivering penalties in a concentrated fashion and controlling key conditions of the interaction—namely time and location. This effectively enables the defender to determine, and when desirable obfuscate, the threshold of aggregate harm that triggers punishment. The \"many possible permutations of punishable actions and their attendant penalties give the defender a wide scope of maneuver,\" introducing the type of uncertainty that should complicate an adversary's risk-benefit analysis. Well-executed, the ability to deliberately create uncertainty could reasonably cause an adversary to guess conservatively about the location of the line of response, delivering a deterrent effect on the utilization of cyberattack.\n# OBSTACLES AND IMPEDIMENTS: COMPETING INTERESTS AND POOR NATIONAL UNITY OF EFFORT\nIf deterrence demands both capability and credibility, then why has deterrence failed in cyberspace? While the US is the \"world's stealthiest, most skilled cyber power,\" since 2006, it has also been the target of more significant cyberattacks than the next seven countries combined. Despite possessing tremendous cyber capabilities and capacity—military and commercial alike—the US is not feared in cyberspace. While this observation demands a theory-based articulation of whether the nature of cyberspace complicates or precludes coercion, such an endeavor is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, it is enough to simply observe that while China is undoubtedly aware of US cyber capabilities, it is increasingly convinced of Washington's lack of resolve to use those capabilities to punish its behavior. However, even if the US can broaden its view of cyberspace, resolve the limitations of its strategic culture, expand its view of attribution, and deliver a strategy that increases its willingness to act, certain obstacles and impediments still weaken the foundations of US deterrent potential in cyberspace.\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nOne such impediment is the lack of trust, communication, collaboration, and cooperation between the government and the private sector. When Google executives were notified in 2009 that the Chinese had compromised their systems, they waited nearly a year to acknowledge the attack publicly. Moreover, Google did not reveal the full extent of the exposure; a server used to store court orders from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had also been compromised. Google's response was not unusual—when targeted by a cyberattack, most American corporations turn to private cybersecurity firms, and are hesitant to work with the US government due to concerns over what federal investigators might find in their computer systems.38 This hesitation to cooperate is based on a lack of trust, which is a natural consequence of competing interests. The private sector fears that the government will pursue its other interests, namely law enforcement, while casting aside corporate concerns over publicity or economic ramifications whenever such interests impede investigation.\nWhile progress on this front may already be underway, there is still much work to be done. In 2018, the US created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a subordinate agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Agency seeks to work across public and private sectors, challenging traditional ways of doing business by engaging with government, industry, academic, and international partners.39 This type of work should posture CISA to pursue the kind of “civilian military government (CMG) integration” needed to incentivize collaboration and cooperation between the public and private sectors. What is missing is transparency and clarity regarding the nature of CISA's relationship with the Intelligence Community (IC), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\nTo partially mitigate the concerns of the private sector, the US government must pass legislation prohibiting CISA from collecting or storing privately owned data found during its cybersecurity response, operations, or forensics investigation activities, while also requiring corporate anonymization in threat reporting to protect corporate interests. Legislation must also clarify that CISA has no investigatory authorities with respect to domestic laws and prohibit any cooperation or communication with the FBI that does not directly advance collective national cybersecurity. Such measures would improve the private sector's perception of this new organization by demonstrating that CISA is capable of, and committed to, pursuing cybersecurity separate from other government functions, helping to establish trust and encourage national collaboration and cooperation unfettered by competing interests.\nAchieving CMG integration would significantly improve two additional challenges that the nation faces in the pursuit of national cybersecurity: a lack of shared understanding of cyber threats and poor unity of effort toward the common interests of cybersecurity. Currently, if thought of as a collective entity, the national “cyber talent pool” is highly fractured and disconnected. Large telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Comcast have very talented infrastructure managers. Silicon Valley attracts software engineering experts. Norton and FireEye target cyber forensics and reverse engineering specialists. There is a large community\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nof independent penetration testers and certified ethical hackers throughout the country. The National Security Agency offers its civil servants the opportunity to specialize in cryptography, code breaking, or intelligence work, and those drawn to the uniform can pursue each of these specialties, and more, by service in one of the uniformed services, and through them the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). However, the tremendous economic incentives of the US private sector make it difficult, if not entirely unrealistic, for the government to recruit and retain the nation's top cyberspace talent. CMG integration may offer an opportunity to partially address this challenge.\nFor well over a decade, there has been an ongoing debate in the US regarding the ethical and security ramifications of allowing the victims of cyberattacks to \"hack-back.\" The idea is poorly received by many, often citing concerns over escalation to war. However, it is nothing short of injustice for the government to acknowledge that it does not have the authorities or capacity to defend private commercial interests, while also constraining the response options of commercial victims of cyberattacks. The fundamental implication of the \"defend forward\" element of the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy is that defending US government networks, critical infrastructure, and key resources requires a willingness and ability to regularly operate beyond US networks in order to disrupt, degrade, or deny adversary offensive capabilities before they reach America's digital shores. It is a phenomenal policy that has clearly improved USCYBERCOM's ability to identify, neutralize, or exploit threats to US government networks. However, the strategy also exposes an injustice, as US law and policy preclude Silicon Valley from taking similar measures, when necessary, to defend its own networks or commercial interests. China does not observe the US delineation between private or public, only national interests. While the US government's position is that the private sector should invest appropriately to defend its networks, defense is clearly not enough.\nSetting aside abstract principled objections, or even existing US or international law, the reality is that restricting the private sector's immense cyber talent from taking the necessary actions to defend US economic interests in cyberspace undermines both collective cybersecurity and deterrence. To marginalize the technical talent of the private sector operationally is akin to a football team that keeps its star players on the bench. If the US thought of cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition, and not merely a domain of military or government conflict, it would not hesitate to fully leverage the best talent available to win the game. Since such a fundamental change to how the US thinks and operates in cyberspace seems unlikely in the near term, improving CMG integration might offer a meaningful compromise.\nOnce CISA establishes a collaborative cybersecurity community that improves the national sight picture of cyber threats, it could assume an additional role by giving the private sector a central point of contact for requesting offensive action in response to foreign cyber aggression against its corporate or economic interests. CISA would then coordinate with the appropriate agency to seek approval of the operation, affording the aggrieved company the opportunity\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nto provide relevant information, and possibly even offer materiel or technical support, toward achieving responsive remedial—and ideally deterrent—action. Imagine, for a moment, Silicon Valley engineers collaborating with the offensive teams of USCYBERCOM to execute timely action in response to China's cyber aggression. This future operation would have better access to both threat intelligence and cyber talent than the current siloed model, with improved capability and credibility—and trust—setting a more solid foundation for deterrence.\n# CONCLUSION\nChina is very effectively using cyberspace to marginalize whatever relative power advantage the US might possess, and this has Beijing on a strategic azimuth to surpass Washington in terms of relative power. Despite possessing more capacity and capability than any nation in the world, the US has been unable to leverage its national abilities to deter undesirable Chinese behavior in cyberspace.^^ This inability to achieve consensus reflects the fact that the US attempts to understand cyberspace largely through analogical reasoning, seeking conceptual understanding through the lens of existing phenomena like war or domestic and international law. This is a fundamentally flawed and limited approach that will continue to contribute to constrained thinking and national policy. Thucydides never would have imagined a world where the strong suffer what they must, while the weak do what they can. By broadening its view of cyberspace, resolving the constraints of its own theories, policies and thinking, and improving private and public sector cooperation, the US can build a better foundation from which to take the type of consistent and credible action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.^^\n# DISCLAIMER\nThe views expressed in this work are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of the United States Military Academy, the Department of the Army, or the Department of Defense.\nSPRING 2023 | 133\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE"

Despite the clear threat, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of cyberspace, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and conceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over other competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.\nWhen Thucydides wrote of envisioned dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, in 400 B.C, one cannot help but wonder whether he knew his words would influence thinking on power and conflict for centuries. A single quote from this Athenian general can be claimed the very progenitor of international relations theory: \"The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\"¹ This anarchic nature of the international political system creates an inherent danger and drives states to concern themselves primarily with power and security.² While the realities of the 21st century have not changed this natural tension between states, they have changed the tactics and strategies states employ. Between great powers, nuclear weapons offer no realistic positive political objective, and the utility of traditional military force has been reduced due to the perceived risk of escalation\nThis is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

Cyberspace has catalyzed and accelerated this type of competition. China has adapted to this reality faster than the United States (US), stealing trillions of dollars in intellectual property (IP) from America's commercial industries and research and development (R&amp;D) from its defense industrial base.⁴ Despite this demonstrated and significant threat to its relative power, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of the cyberspace domain, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and ceding to the influences of its own strategic culture.

Certainly, any deterrence strategy should account for the unique motives, costs, and risks of specific undesirable adversary behavior. For example, Russian state-led efforts to destabilize US institutions and manipulate the electorate involve benefits, costs, and risks that are distinct in scope, scale, and influence when compared to a non-state actor's relatively simplistic employment of ransomware to obtain economic resources. To influence an adversary's decision calculus and deter undesirable behavior, deterrence strategies should be deliberately catered to these unique considerations. The question is, then: Of the myriad ways China uses cyberspace in the pursuit of its national interests, what specific behavior should the US seek to deter?\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChina's laws, policies, and actions indicate three overarching priorities in cyberspace: domestic control and regime stability, espionage, and access to technology.⁵ The worldwide expansion of the Internet toward the end of the 20ᵗʰ century was largely shaped by the West. The thinking amongst the technological elite was that expanded connectivity, access to information, and unrestricted digital speech would have a liberalizing influence on the world, tempering and marginalizing authoritarian rule. Unfortunately, China quickly recognized the Internet's potential for unregulated free speech and uncontrolled proliferation of information, which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as existential threats to party security, control, and legitimacy.⁶ In response, by implementing measures such as the \"Great Firewall,\" as well as state-leveraged intermediary liability and a state-controlled information technology industry, the CCP has managed to turn the Internet into a massive tool of domestic surveillance and censorship.⁷ While this state behavior is at odds with the values of American democratic society, it should not be the primary focus of deterrence.\nChina's second priority in cyberspace, espionage, is complicated by matters of moral authority and legitimacy. The US, having significantly shaped and influenced the current rules-based international order, is committed to the norms and laws of the system and seeks to maintain international support through action that is consistent with its principles. James Clapper, then Director of National Intelligence, stated in 2015 that in cyberspace \"there is a difference between an act of espionage, which we conduct as well, and other nations do, versus an attack.\"⁸ This recognition that the US conducts cyber espionage tacitly acknowledges the legitimacy of espionage in cyberspace. It also tangentially supports both the idea that espionage is a sovereign right and the belief that espionage has a fundamentally stabilizing influence in the international system, as improved awareness of adversary capabilities can temper expectations of benefit from the use of force. While the US should expect states to continue cyber espionage, a policy of deterrence would be manifest hypocrisy.\nWe then consider China's third priority in cyberspace—access to technology. China has demonstrated an extensive willingness and ability to exploit and access public and private networks worldwide in the pursuit of information and IP, particularly defense-related or technologically innovative R&amp;D.⁹ China's IP theft should not be dismissed as merely a private sector or economic concern. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center emphasizes this in its 2018 annual report, depicting foreign economic and industrial espionage as a significant threat to US prosperity, security, and competitive advantage.¹⁰ China's ability to reap the benefit of massive American investments in military and commercial R&amp;D diffuses US relative power within the international system. It also allows China to negate one of the most consequential competitive advantages of America's democratic, capitalist system over China's authoritarian, state-planned economy—the innovative forces of economic incentive in an open-market system.¹¹\nSPRING 2023 | 121\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe US has been slow to realize, and slower still to respond to, the gravity of the threat posed by China's theft of IP. The speed and operational tradecraft, as well as the breadth and diversity of targets involved, strain Washington's ability to appreciate the scope and scale of the collective impact to US national interests. For the sake of comparison, the military is quite proficient at contextualizing the direct, tangible threat that adversary military forces pose to national security. Weapon system ranges, hypersonic weapon speeds, operational reach, and force projection are all relatively easily understood and measured concepts that translate well to traditional conceptualizations of threats to national security. What is more difficult to measure, and thereby contextualize in degree and severity of vulnerability and effect, is the cumulative impact of comparatively abstract grey zone threats and attacks that target the intersection of security and other national interests.\nFor example, Russian social media disinformation and misinformation efforts target a state's national psyche, polarizing the electorate and undermining a democratic state's ability to achieve political and social consensus by exploiting the seams among freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and national security. Chinese IP theft exploits a different vulnerability: the seams among national security, commercial enterprise, and economic prosperity. When adversaries target these seams, they create not only uncertainty about the extent of what is happening but also an inability or unwillingness to coordinate and execute the type of assertive, credible, associative, and timely national response needed to achieve deterrence. Yet, purely with respect to economic prosperity and relative power, the collective costs of cyberattacks may very well compete with or outweigh the net costs of any war in US history.\n# CYBERSPACE: UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON\nTo improve the conceptual foundations needed to deliver policies and strategies that could realistically create the conditions needed for deterrence, the US must first expand how it views the phenomenon of cyberspace. Throughout much of the 21st century, the government and military communities debated the question of whether or not cyberspace is a domain of warfare, equal in status and warfighting significance to the maritime, land, air, and space domains.[12] This particular question appears to be at least partially resolved, with the military's position apparent in its definition of \"cyberspace\" in Joint Publication 3-12: \"the domain [emphasis added] within the information environment that consists of the interdependent network of information technology (IT) infrastructures and resident data.\"[13]\nA myopic focus on the military aspects of cyberspace is insufficient for the US to pursue and defend its national interests. While cyberspace certainly creates opportunities and vulnerabilities during war, it also offers US enemies a low-cost opportunity to pursue their strategic interests during peace, entirely negating the coercive and deterrent influences of US economic and military might. This ability of a state or an individual actor to pursue their interests through cyberspace, unthreatened and unimpeded by any relative power asymmetries that\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nexist, suggests that the environment should not be thought of as the \"fourth military offset,\" but as an international relations offset.¹⁴ The figure below depicts cyberspace not merely as a military domain, but a broad spectrum, while also highlighting the relatively small portion of cyberspace where the military primarily operates.\n|  Competition |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | Conflict  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Social Functions |   | Economic Functions |   |   | Government Functions  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Medical | Academia | Media | Commercial | Industrial | Law Enforcement | Homeland Security | Foreign | Military |   |\nFigure 1: Cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition and conflict.\nCyberspace is not a domain where national business is conducted, and national interests are pursued in isolated silos. Instead, the US must view cyberspace as a broad and interconnected spectrum that supports and enables the sources and instruments of national power across the entire continuum of competition to conflict on a geopolitical—not just a military—battlefield.\nYet, the continued evolution of war, and therefore the military instrument of national power, has resulted in a US military that performs functions and duties that go well beyond traditional armed conflict. From nation-building, including the construction of schools and hospitals or training of judges and politicians in Afghanistan, to humanitarian assistance, disaster recovery, and agricultural development in Africa, the military is no longer a simple hammer, but has become a geopolitical multi-purpose tool.¹⁵ However, while the modern US military is capable of far more than applying conventional force in the pursuit of political objectives, this does not change the fact that it is still built primarily for war. This belligerent purpose not only influences military culture, recruitment efforts, virtues, and norms, but drives how the military trains and disciplines itself, educates its leaders, and is entirely deterministic in how it identifies, prioritizes, develops, and acquires its capabilities. War is not merely what the military plans for but shapes the very process that the military uses to plan.\nWithin game theory, a finite game is one in which either the rules of the game or the incentives of the players serve to ensure that the game ends with clear winners and losers. Since nations in an armed conflict seek or are generally incentivized to end the conflict, a declared period of war is a finite game. Geopolitical competition between the US and China, however, is an infinite game, since it is reasonable to assert that neither party is sufficiently incentivized realistically to seek a permanent and definitive culmination of the competition.¹⁶ Instead, both parties seek to establish and exploit their own competitive advantages while avoiding or negating their opponent's comparative strengths. Understanding the temporal character of both competition and conflict should inform, if not determine, the dominant strategies of the game, influencing how players think about time, resources, maneuver, and objectives. The macro trends of twenty-first century competition and conflict thus far indicate that while the nature of cyberspace provides actors with ample opportunity for influence, espionage, exploitation, and subversion, the environment is significantly less conducive to coercion than other domains.\nSPRING 2023 | 123\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nAn important implication here may be that cyberspace is better suited for the pursuit of broad objectives in an infinite game, as opposed to the narrowly defined and time-constrained objectives of a finite game.\nFor instance, Moscow's failure to meaningfully disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate its national defense through employment of cyber capabilities prior to or during Russia's invasion supports the idea that cyberspace is better postured for broad geopolitical competition objectives than discrete, narrowly tailored war objectives. Despite a decade of politicians, military leaders, academics, and pundits alike predicting a future conflict largely decided by cyber means, it does not appear that Russia mounted a consequential cyber offensive as part of its invasion. This has caused some to doubt the current or future strategic utility of cyberspace.[17] However, prudence demands caution before making definitive statements or attempting conclusions regarding Russia's failure, as both time and declassification are equally likely to disprove many seemingly factual observations. If Russia has employed cyberspace capabilities as part of its invasion of Ukraine, very few observers have the means to observe and assess their impact sufficiently, or understand the degree that commercial, state, or non-state entities aided in the defense of Ukrainian cyberspace.\nWhether Russia failed to develop, integrate, and deliver strategically consequential cyber effects, or the Microsoft, Anonymous, and NATO-supported community-based cyberspace defense efforts succeeded in neutralizing those effects, both potentialities provide logical support to the argument that cyberspace is better suited to geopolitical conflict than war. Russia has demonstrated the ability, when unconstrained by time and comparatively broad in its desired targets or effects, to shut down national electric grids as part of a broader geopolitical effort to destabilize its opponents or competitors.[18] In contrast, it appears that Russia has learned that during war—or a finite game—it needed to count on the effectiveness of specific capabilities and effects against a narrowly defined set of targets on a specific timeline. While military capabilities like tanks, bombers and aircraft carriers offer military planners the ability to predict or make realistic assumptions about the types of effects the military can deliver on a particular timeline, capabilities and vulnerabilities in cyberspace are often ephemeral, offering much less predictability or reliability over time.\nBy comparison, objectives during geopolitical competition are not as often constrained by time, do not always include narrowly defined targets, or demand discrete or tailored effects. Russia's ability to influence the 2016 US election was not only the result of years of effort, but the nature of the political objective meant that Russian actors in cyberspace had nearly unlimited targets and potential effects they could reasonably claim to be influencing the election. Additionally, as is often the case with well-conceived information operations, the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which Russia compromised the election created additional division and distrust within the electorate. Russia also had the benefit of rehearsals for its techniques, having targeted several elections in Belarus, Ukraine, and, of course, its own internal elections since 2007.[19]\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nChinese IP theft via cyberspace is similarly a matter of geopolitical competition in which China, seeking to out-compete the US over time, pursues broad objectives against a diverse set of targets and effects. Washington should carefully reconsider the wisdom of leaning too heavily on its finite-game player (the military) to counter China's infinite-game strategy, while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of whether the US seeks to win, or out-compete, before establishing policies or strategies that direct how it uses national resources to play the game.\nRegardless, if deterrence—or the ability to dissuade Beijing from certain behavior because the perceived benefits do not justify the perceived costs and risks—is the objective of US policy regarding Chinese IP theft, this will require the ability to influence CCP perceptions and intention.²⁰ Targeting and influencing perception requires both capability and credibility. However, before discussing strategies for using capability and credibility to influence perception and intention, it must be understood that existing deterrence theory was developed largely to deter aggression.²¹\nWithin the context of international relations, as well as deterrence theory, aggression is most often a matter of the coercive threat or use of force between states. Yet, it is exceedingly counterproductive to limit the conversation of cyberattacks to this narrow context, not only because most attacks in cyberspace offer poor analogical parallel to the concept of force in the physical world, but also because force is not defined in the United Nations (UN) Charter. To date neither the US nor China—despite overwhelming evidence of cyberattacks that undermine their national interests and threaten the security of their critical infrastructure—has invoked the protection of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibiting the use of force. That neither state has claimed this protection supports the assertion that most cyberattacks should not be considered within the context of military force employment.\n## NO LAWS OF UNARMED CONFLICT: REVISITING OUR THEORIES, LAWS, AND CONCEPTS\nWithout international consensus characterizing the preponderance of state behavior in cyberspace as \"force,\" logic should then demand skepticism among cyber policymakers regarding the wholesale applicability, and advisability of deference to, existing theories, laws, and norms surrounding the conventional use of force to competition or conflict in cyberspace. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), for instance, is a body of international law intended to limit humanitarian impacts caused during the use of force between states. If there is no existing law or normative international agreement characterizing state cyberattacks against other states as force, what is the virtue or value of allowing restraining concepts like proportionality, distinction, or military necessity to interfere with the defense—or pursuit, for that matter—of national interests in cyberspace? Why would the US elect to conduct the cognitive gymnastics necessary to frame cyberattacks within the context of LOAC? To avoid the ire of operational law attorneys, this article will sidestep the nuances and technicalities of the legal debate by\nSPRING 2023 | 125\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nsimply asserting that LOAC is an analogically poor framework for regulating state behavior in cyberspace. While there remains insufficient international consensus to establish the type of norms needed to constrain state behavior, insistence upon applying the constraints of LOAC is diffusing US relative power and restraining US ability to deter aggression in cyberspace.\nExtant deterrence theory and policies should be viewed with similar skepticism. Classical deterrence theory, devised to disincentivize the aggressive use of force between states, may prove insufficient in deterring the unique forms of aggressive state behavior seen in cyberspace. In their book *Cross-Domain Deterrence*, Jon R. Lindsey and Erik Gartzke note that classic deterrence theory is itself a historical product of a particular technological innovation—nuclear weapons—and cast doubt on the theory's application to the emergence of new technologies.[22]\nThe unique nature of cyberspace, and the fledgling historical record of competition and conflict therein, also gives reason to question strategic assumptions regarding the propensity for escalation, both within cyberspace as well as the cross-domain variety. In *The Perfect Weapon*, David Sanger notes that one reason the US cannot figure out how to counter cyberattacks is its belief that response incurs a great risk of escalation.[23] However, hesitation by the US to respond to attacks in cyberspace over concerns of escalation is poorly founded, based more on sentiment and abstraction than historical or empirical evidence. To the contrary, two decades of state competition and conflict in cyberspace suggest that a rational actor in the current international system will not use traditional military force as a response to cyberattacks that deliver only economic or information effects. To attribute the observed lack of proliferation in kinetic effects delivered through cyberspace to some inherently deterrent influence of cyberpower itself is logically lacking, as the cyber domain in that situation becomes merely a medium for cross-domain kinetic effect.\nIt is also logically consistent that the effects of conventional deterrence would have cross-domain influence, deterring escalation from cyber effect to kinetic action both internally and externally to the cyber domain. It stands to reason that any cyberattack that delivers armed attack equivalent effects will be treated by a state no differently than conventional force employment. In such a case, the medium of delivery is logically relevant, but should be inconsequential, as there would be little rational reason for a state to treat such an attack any differently than the use of land, maritime, or air power to deliver conventional force.\nIt can also be counterproductive to constrain thinking on national cybersecurity to extant military theory or doctrine. For instance, the wisdom of Clausewitz contributes to the theoretical foundations of belligerency the assertion that between two parties with equal means, defense is not only easier than attack but is the stronger and more superior form of fighting.[24] Here it should be noted that Clausewitz differentiates between \"pure defense,\" or the act of waiting for a blow that permanently leaves the initiative with the enemy, and \"relative defense,\" which encompasses both defensive and offensive maneuver for the purpose of either attriting the enemy or deliberately manipulating time and/or space in order to negate an enemy's temporal\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nadvantage or influence the enemy's decision calculus.²⁵ Clausewitz casts pure defense aside as contrary to the very idea of war. In cyberspace pure defense—static defense measures such as firewalls, antivirus scanners, personal security products, and other automated security tools employed and monitored by system administrators and network defenders—certainly has an important place in geopolitical competition, conflict, and war.\nClausewitz’s characterization of the asymmetries of interest and the nature of interplay between the offense and defense, as well as other supporting arguments for the general superiority of the defense, also apply inconsistently to conflict in cyberspace. The unique aspects of cyberspace, including the inherent obfuscation of identity, the relative ease of concealing digital presence and activities, the lack of geographic buffers, and the compression of both time and distance, combine to provide distinct advantages to the attacker over the defender.²⁶ In an infinite game, the advantages of maneuver, objective, initiative, economy of force, unity of command, simplicity, speed, and surprise all belong to the offense.\nWhile the debate over the comparative advantages of offense or defense in cyberspace is unlikely to culminate in foreseeable future, the 21st century experience suggests that while the best defense in cyberspace might require some offensive action, deterrence in cyberspace will undoubtedly require both. Deterrence by denial—or lowering an adversary’s expectation of success—is supported through improved cybersecurity and defensive measures intended to frustrate, mitigate, or prevent cyberattacks. Yet, there are dual asymmetries to resolve in deterring IP theft through cyberspace. First, the fundamental and inherent asymmetry between the significant potential benefits and comparatively low costs and barriers to entry makes it difficult to deter IP theft exclusively through defense. This, combined with an asymmetry of vulnerability created by US commitment to open societies, capitalist market-based economies, and global interdependency, makes it unlikely that defense alone can achieve deterrence.\nThe fact that China’s IP theft occurs within an infinite game only compounds this reality. In an infinite game, the low cost of offense and significant financial and manpower costs of defense make it is unrealistic to expect defense alone to reduce state perceptions of benefit sufficiently to a level that achieves deterrence over time. While the continued maturation of security-focused network architectures such as zero-trust, as well as increased integration of automation or even artificial intelligence, may with time improve the effectiveness of defense and cybersecurity, there is little reason to doubt that offensive techniques and attack capabilities will be similarly improved in the time needed to implement these defensive measures. Yet, when reduced perception or likelihood of benefit is combined with increased perception of costs and risks, achieved through consistent and credible punishment, deterrence might be possible.\nOn top of the need to critically evaluate the applicability of existing theory, laws, and norms to cyberspace, it is prudent to reflect on US cyber policy, as the credibility of US national response to Chinese IP theft has been constrained by a variety of policy and bureaucratic\nSPRING 2023 | 127\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nlimitations across presidential administrations.27 One such constraining influence is America's strategic culture, which is the idea that deeply rooted cultural preferences exert influence on strategic choices, and that a nation's security history imposes a certain inertia on the decisions of the state in a way that can make strategy less responsive to modern evolutions in the character of competition and conflict.28 In cyberspace, an artifact of the multi-decade Cold War is that the US maintains a significant strategic preference for intelligence over effects. Since 2011, options for decisive offensive cyber operations in response to cyberattacks have been presented regularly to national leadership. A common objection to offensive operations, often coming from the U.S. Intelligence Community, is that offensive action poses risk to intelligence collection capabilities while delivering only a limited or short-lived benefit.29 However, consistent deference to this view has destroyed Washington's ability to establish the credibility needed to deter cyber aggression. The predictability of the US strategic preference for economic stability, diplomatic influence, and intelligence collection over deterrence in cyberspace inexorably undermines its own credibility.\nWhile strategic culture is certainly an obstacle, the challenge of attribution also constrains US thinking and consistency of action in cyberspace.30 Cyber attribution, the process of identifying and laying blame on the actor of a cyberattack, is strained by many unique aspects of cyberspace itself. The logical rules that govern how networked devices communicate serve to obfuscate identity in a way that is understandably confusing to a lawyer or a politician, but much less so to a trained cyber professional. The challenge of convincing non-technical policy and decision-makers of the significance and accuracy of cyber forensics evidence has certainly contributed to a decade of failure deterring aggression in cyberspace. The US must mature not only its understanding of attribution, but its willingness to act in situations of attributional uncertainty, if the nation is to achieve the consistency of action needed for deterrence.\nThere are five “elements” of attributing action in cyberspace, including persona, geopolitical, geographic, logical, and physical layers. Each element can be independently and definitively determined through advanced cyber forensics. An in-depth articulation of the nuances of each element is not needed to understand the greater point: the US should reject the thinking that all five elements of attribution must be satisfied to justify action in response to cyberattacks. Currently, US decision-makers are holding attribution for actions in cyberspace to an unnecessarily high standard when each singular element of attribution offers a unique objective justification for a wide variety of potential national response actions. In other domains, decisions regarding US military action are often made based on comprehensive, multi-factor intelligence assessments. The same type of assessment is possible in cyberspace.\n## ADDRESSING THE CONSTRAINTS OF ATTRIBUTION\nA multi-factor cyberspace attribution assessment would combine cyber forensics evidence with an analysis of the historical records of cyberattacks, economic and geopolitical\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nmotivations, as well as signals and human intelligence, to enable analysts to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive, contextually informed confidence assessment. This framework would deliberately allow for some subjectivity, including an assessment of whether a cyberattack is consistent with enemy state interests, previously attributed cyberattacks, or known state cyber capabilities and signatures. Combining objective forensics evidence with subjective intelligence analysis should serve to improve the comfort level of decision-makers in approving and directing timely and decisive action in response to cyberattacks.\nThe US cyber response playbook should include the widest possible variety of punitive and responsive legal, diplomatic, informational, economic, and military actions. Such actions should include international or domestic indictment, as well as the colloquial \"name and shame\" brand of embarrassing public statements and condemnation. In 2015, President Obama demonstrated that the evidence of cyberattacks can be used quite effectively as leverage during diplomatic or trade negotiations.[31] The US should also expand its use of economic punishment measures to target the material interests of not only national governments, but also private commercial entities that enable enemy cyberattacks. In addition, of course, the US can use overt, covert, or clandestine offensive cyberspace operations for a wide variety of deliberate effects. Each of these potential responses receives a unique degree of logical support from the individual elements of attribution.\nFor example, consider a cyberattack in which the US can definitively identify the physical devices used during an attack, as well as the geographic location—in, such as China—of the equipment during the attack. Without the ability to attribute the persona element or geopolitical association (individual hacktivist versus government-sanctioned operative) of the attacker, it is perfectly reasonable to take certain playbook options, like indictment, off the table. However, given the location of the attack origin, this partial attribution offers at least some value as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, while actions targeting the device(s) or the material interests of any identified enablers would also be justified. For the sake of contrast, in the less common scenario in which the identity and geopolitical association of an attacker can be attributed, the entire playbook should be viewed as available, with or without definitive attribution of the physical or logical layers of the equipment used during the attack.\nYet, obfuscation of identity is only one way that the challenge of attribution strains a state's ability to deter aggression in cyberspace. Not only is it possible for a skilled cyber actor to obfuscate or destroy digital evidence of their presence and actions, but attributional efforts are further frustrated by the pace of technological change, the inherent and real-time customizability of cyberspace capabilities, and the omnipresent need for secrecy to protect both capabilities and a state's awareness of adversary vulnerabilities. The consequence here is that attributing action in cyberspace will, for the foreseeable future, undermine the type of timely, transactional, and associative punitive response needed to sufficiently signal to adversaries a correlation between cause and effect.\nSPRING 2023 | 129\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nThis inescapable delay between cyberattack and punishment poses a serious problem within the cognitive confines of classical deterrence theory, as a state that intends to signal or deliver punishment for undesirable behavior needs to do so in a timely and associative manner. With the nature of cyberspace naturally complicating timely response, perhaps deterrence in cyberspace demands that states evolve thinking beyond transactional tit-for-tat responses to seemingly isolated incidents of cyberattacks, and instead respond comprehensively to the collective and cumulative impacts of an adversary's actions to the state's national interests.\nLucas Kello, the director of the Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, expands upon this idea in his 2021 article in the Journal of Cybersecurity: \"Cyber Legalism: why it fails and what to do about it.\" In the article, Kello articulates four principles that should inform better doctrine for cyber conflict. His first principle, the \"accretional principle,\" suggests that states should treat attacks as strategic campaigns, not individual actions.[32] If cyberattacks were punished cumulatively, it would allow a state to target the psychological component of adversarial decision making without the constraints of time, possibly even reducing the burden of attribution through aggregation. Similar to the Clausewitzian notion of relative defense, a strategy that observes the accretional principle would allow the victim of cyberattacks to maintain initiative by delivering penalties in a concentrated fashion and controlling key conditions of the interaction—namely time and location. This effectively enables the defender to determine, and when desirable obfuscate, the threshold of aggregate harm that triggers punishment. The \"many possible permutations of punishable actions and their attendant penalties give the defender a wide scope of maneuver,\" introducing the type of uncertainty that should complicate an adversary's risk-benefit analysis. Well-executed, the ability to deliberately create uncertainty could reasonably cause an adversary to guess conservatively about the location of the line of response, delivering a deterrent effect on the utilization of cyberattack.[33]\n# OBSTACLES AND IMPEDIMENTS: COMPETING INTERESTS AND POOR NATIONAL UNITY OF EFFORT\nIf deterrence demands both capability and credibility, then why has deterrence failed in cyberspace? While the US is the \"world's stealthiest, most skilled cyber power,\"[34] since 2006, it has also been the target of more significant cyberattacks than the next seven countries combined.[35] Despite possessing tremendous cyber capabilities and capacity—military and commercial alike—the US is not feared in cyberspace.[36] While this observation demands a theory-based articulation of whether the nature of cyberspace complicates or precludes coercion, such an endeavor is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, it is enough to simply observe that while China is undoubtedly aware of US cyber capabilities, it is increasingly convinced of Washington's lack of resolve to use those capabilities to punish its behavior.[37] However, even if the US can broaden its view of cyberspace, resolve the limitations of its strategic culture, expand its view of attribution, and deliver a strategy that increases its willingness to act, certain obstacles and impediments still weaken the foundations of US deterrent potential in cyberspace.\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nOne such impediment is the lack of trust, communication, collaboration, and cooperation between the government and the private sector. When Google executives were notified in 2009 that the Chinese had compromised their systems, they waited nearly a year to acknowledge the attack publicly. Moreover, Google did not reveal the full extent of the exposure; a server used to store court orders from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had also been compromised. Google's response was not unusual—when targeted by a cyberattack, most American corporations turn to private cybersecurity firms, and are hesitant to work with the US government due to concerns over what federal investigators might find in their computer systems.38 This hesitation to cooperate is based on a lack of trust, which is a natural consequence of competing interests. The private sector fears that the government will pursue its other interests, namely law enforcement, while casting aside corporate concerns over publicity or economic ramifications whenever such interests impede investigation.\nWhile progress on this front may already be underway, there is still much work to be done. In 2018, the US created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a subordinate agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Agency seeks to work across public and private sectors, challenging traditional ways of doing business by engaging with government, industry, academic, and international partners.39 This type of work should posture CISA to pursue the kind of “civilian military government (CMG) integration” needed to incentivize collaboration and cooperation between the public and private sectors. What is missing is transparency and clarity regarding the nature of CISA's relationship with the Intelligence Community (IC), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\nTo partially mitigate the concerns of the private sector, the US government must pass legislation prohibiting CISA from collecting or storing privately owned data found during its cybersecurity response, operations, or forensics investigation activities, while also requiring corporate anonymization in threat reporting to protect corporate interests. Legislation must also clarify that CISA has no investigatory authorities with respect to domestic laws and prohibit any cooperation or communication with the FBI that does not directly advance collective national cybersecurity. Such measures would improve the private sector's perception of this new organization by demonstrating that CISA is capable of, and committed to, pursuing cybersecurity separate from other government functions, helping to establish trust and encourage national collaboration and cooperation unfettered by competing interests.\nAchieving CMG integration would significantly improve two additional challenges that the nation faces in the pursuit of national cybersecurity: a lack of shared understanding of cyber threats and poor unity of effort toward the common interests of cybersecurity. Currently, if thought of as a collective entity, the national “cyber talent pool” is highly fractured and disconnected. Large telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Comcast have very talented infrastructure managers. Silicon Valley attracts software engineering experts. Norton and FireEye target cyber forensics and reverse engineering specialists. There is a large community\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE\nof independent penetration testers and certified ethical hackers throughout the country. The National Security Agency offers its civil servants the opportunity to specialize in cryptography, code breaking, or intelligence work, and those drawn to the uniform can pursue each of these specialties, and more, by service in one of the uniformed services, and through them the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). However, the tremendous economic incentives of the US private sector make it difficult, if not entirely unrealistic, for the government to recruit and retain the nation's top cyberspace talent. CMG integration may offer an opportunity to partially address this challenge.\nFor well over a decade, there has been an ongoing debate in the US regarding the ethical and security ramifications of allowing the victims of cyberattacks to \"hack-back.\" The idea is poorly received by many, often citing concerns over escalation to war. However, it is nothing short of injustice for the government to acknowledge that it does not have the authorities or capacity to defend private commercial interests, while also constraining the response options of commercial victims of cyberattacks.[40] The fundamental implication of the \"defend forward\" element of the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy is that defending US government networks, critical infrastructure, and key resources requires a willingness and ability to regularly operate beyond US networks in order to disrupt, degrade, or deny adversary offensive capabilities before they reach America's digital shores. It is a phenomenal policy that has clearly improved USCYBERCOM's ability to identify, neutralize, or exploit threats to US government networks. However, the strategy also exposes an injustice, as US law and policy preclude Silicon Valley from taking similar measures, when necessary, to defend its own networks or commercial interests. China does not observe the US delineation between private or public, only national interests. While the US government's position is that the private sector should invest appropriately to defend its networks, defense is clearly not enough.\nSetting aside abstract principled objections, or even existing US or international law, the reality is that restricting the private sector's immense cyber talent from taking the necessary actions to defend US economic interests in cyberspace undermines both collective cybersecurity and deterrence. To marginalize the technical talent of the private sector operationally is akin to a football team that keeps its star players on the bench. If the US thought of cyberspace as a spectrum of geopolitical competition, and not merely a domain of military or government conflict, it would not hesitate to fully leverage the best talent available to win the game. Since such a fundamental change to how the US thinks and operates in cyberspace seems unlikely in the near term, improving CMG integration might offer a meaningful compromise.\nOnce CISA establishes a collaborative cybersecurity community that improves the national sight picture of cyber threats, it could assume an additional role by giving the private sector a central point of contact for requesting offensive action in response to foreign cyber aggression against its corporate or economic interests. CISA would then coordinate with the appropriate agency to seek approval of the operation, affording the aggrieved company the opportunity\nTHE CYBER DEFENSE REVIEW\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTRAVIS \"TJ\" SIEMION\nto provide relevant information, and possibly even offer materiel or technical support, toward achieving responsive remedial—and ideally deterrent—action. Imagine, for a moment, Silicon Valley engineers collaborating with the offensive teams of USCYBERCOM to execute timely action in response to China's cyber aggression. This future operation would have better access to both threat intelligence and cyber talent than the current siloed model, with improved capability and credibility—and trust—setting a more solid foundation for deterrence.\n# CONCLUSION\nChina is very effectively using cyberspace to marginalize whatever relative power advantage the US might possess, and this has Beijing on a strategic azimuth to surpass Washington in terms of relative power. Despite possessing more capacity and capability than any nation in the world, the US has been unable to leverage its national abilities to deter undesirable Chinese behavior in cyberspace.^[41]^ This inability to achieve consensus reflects the fact that the US attempts to understand cyberspace largely through analogical reasoning, seeking conceptual understanding through the lens of existing phenomena like war or domestic and international law. This is a fundamentally flawed and limited approach that will continue to contribute to constrained thinking and national policy. Thucydides never would have imagined a world where the strong suffer what they must, while the weak do what they can. By broadening its view of cyberspace, resolving the constraints of its own theories, policies and thinking, and improving private and public sector cooperation, the US can build a better foundation from which to take the type of consistent and credible action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace.^[42]^\n# DISCLAIMER\nThe views expressed in this work are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of the United States Military Academy, the Department of the Army, or the Department of Defense.\nSPRING 2023 | 133\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:09:10 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nRETHINKING US CONCEPTS AND ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE"

    "abstract": "China's use of cyberspace is a significant threat to US relative power in an inherently dangerous and anarchic international system. Despite the clear threat, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of cyberspace, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and conceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over other competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter China's aggression in cyberspace. When Thucydides wrote of envisioned dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, in 400 B.C, one cannot help but wonder whether he knew his words would influence thinking on power and conflict for centuries. A single quote from this Athenian general can be claimed the very progenitor of international relations theory: \"The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\"¹ This anarchic nature of the international political system creates an inherent danger and drives states to concern themselves primarily with power and security.² While the realities of the 21st century have not changed this natural tension between states, they have changed the tactics and strategies states employ. Between great powers, nuclear weapons offer no realistic positive political objective, and the utility of traditional military force has been reduced due to the perceived risk of escalation This is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

After enlisting in the U.S. Army in 2001, he deployed to Iraq in 2003 as a paralegal specialist focused on operational law and criminal justice. He graduated as Dean's Distinguished Graduate and Distinguished Military Graduate from the University of Texas at Austin, commissioning as a Military Intelligence officer. After commanding a counterintelligence detachment, he deployed with Special Operations Joint Task Force-Alghanistan in 2014. Joining Cyber Branch shortly after, he served on a National Mission Team and commanded a cyber company in the 780th MI Brigade, followed by Aide-de-camp to the Commanding General of the Cyber Center of Excellence, and Capability Developer for the Persistent Cyber Training Environment. He is currently the Chief of Cyber/EW Modernization in the Department of the Army Management Office for Strategic Operations. to nuclear war.³ This has resulted in an expansion of competition below the level of armed conflict. Cyberspace has catalyzed and accelerated this type of competition. China has adapted to this reality faster than the United States (US), stealing trillions of dollars in intellectual property (IP) from America's commercial industries and research and development (R&D) from its defense industrial base.⁴ Despite this demonstrated and significant threat to its relative power, the US limits its own deterrent potential by maintaining a narrow view of the cyberspace domain, applying a restrictive understanding of cyber attribution, and ceding to the influences of its own strategic culture. By prioritizing deterrence over competing interests, while also adopting a broader view of the domain and a more stratified view of cyber attribution, the US can improve its ability to take the type of consistent, credible, and decisive action needed to deter Chinese aggression in cyberspace.",
