Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response.\n\n© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n\n# 1.

The intended effects of cyberattacks are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyberattack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyberattack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.⁴\n\nWhen carried out, it aims to disrupt, disable, destroy, interfere, steal or control the data, information and functionality of the attacked computer or critical infrastructure.⁵ Generally, these attacks may be carried out by individuals, acting alone, or with others; terrorist organizations; non-state actors working for a State; or by State agencies⁶ – a prominent example of which was Russia's interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election using series of cyberattacks coordinated by State agencies.⁷\n\nCyberattacks have taken different spectrums over the years, and the U.S. defense agencies have identified them. These include Network Denial, Enterprise Denial, Enterprise Manipulation, Mission Denial, and Mission Manipulation.⁸ The methods of carrying out cyberattacks are numerous. A consideration of these methods is outside the scope of this paper. But they deserve mention:\n\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Phishing attacks\n- Drive-by-download attack\n- Password Attack\n- SQL Injection Attack\n- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\n- Eavesdropping attack\n\nThis paper focuses on cyberattack, as distinguished from cybercrime and cyberwar. One of the best efforts showing the distinction amongst the concepts of cyberattack, cybercrime and cyberwar is that of Hathaway et al. in the paper, The Law of Cyber-Attack. To the authors, a cyberattack is “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.”¹⁰ To this end, any attack that is “not carried out for a political or national security purpose, such as most instances of internet fraud, identity theft, and intellectual property piracy, does not fit this final element of a “cyberattack” and is therefore mere cyber-crime.”¹¹\n\nAlso, cyberattacks are distinguishable from cyberwar. To Hathaway et al., ‘cyber-warfare’ is... a term properly used only to refer to the small subset of cyber-attacks that do constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict.¹² From this distinction, a cyberattack may not constitute an armed attack under international law and thus, the retaliation to it is expected to fall short of an armed response.¹³ Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, attacks on any of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by the Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21)¹⁴ and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which though, do not have an effects equivalent to an “armed attack,” are classified as cyberattacks.¹⁵ This is because attacks on critical infrastructures pose a national security challenge as it may be injurious to both the people and the environment – for instance, the hacking of a critical infrastructure which releases toxic substance.¹⁶ According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the U.S. experienced an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks in 2021, with the critical infrastructures a major target.¹⁷\n\n⁴ DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, Memorandum for Chiefs of the Military Services, Commanders of the Combatant Commands and Directors of the Joint Staff Directorates (2011) https://info.publicintelligence.net/DoD-JointCyberTerms.pdf.\n\n⁵ Michael Power, Michael Pease, Keith Stouffer, CheeYee Tang, Timothy Zimmerman, Joseph Brule, et al.

Cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation, are related in some way. For instance, some scholars have classified characterization as part of the attribution process and to them, characterization is the attribution of cyberattacks to classes of adversaries.[18] These three processes are necessary in responding to cyberattacks and developing a robust cyber defense system.[19]\n\nThis paper is divided into six sections. After this introduction, Section 2 will focus on the U.S. characterization policies. Section 3 deals with attribution policies of cyberattacks against the U.S. Section 4 discusses the retaliation policies for cyberattacks against the U.S. The paper seeks to synthesize and answer the unanswered law and policy questions on characterization, attribution, and retaliation. To this end, the paper will critique the existing U.S. laws and policies on cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation. Section 5 will recommend laws and policies to address the identified gaps. Section 6 – the conclusion – will summarize the paper.\n\n# 2. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack characterization law and policy\n\nThe characterization process for cyberattacks by the U.S. intelligence and military agencies is not clear. There is equally no international standard for characterization.[20] In simple terms, characterization means the interpretation given to the abnormality that occurs to the proper functioning of a computer system.[21] Generally, the proper functioning of a computer system may be disrupted for different reasons, such as, human error, natural events or it may be deliberate (an attack). Where it is an attack, characterization is usually determined by the extent of the consequences of the attack.[22] Characterization is important in the response process for two main reasons. First, it shapes how to respond to the cyberattack. For instance, where it is determined that the attack is malicious, characterization will help in the deployment of appropriate response. Secondly, characterization is important to strengthen the cyber defense.[23]\n\nAn attack may be characterized in different ways: It may be for financial gains; for espionage; for service disruption; shaming; information gathering, among other. To characterize, the U.S. cyber threat intelligence community (CTIC)[24] and private sector companies, as a preliminary step, usually identify the potential source of the attack in order to monitor and determine how to respond to such attack. This has proved difficult, as the U.S. has continued to research the blueprints of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors, (that is, highly motivated, sophisticated, and organized threat groups).[25] For instance, between March and October 2021, the CTIC monitored Iranian government-sponsored APT actors. In March 2021, the FBI and CISA first observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors leverage Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet vulnerabilities to target a broad range of victims across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in furtherance of malicious activities. The monitoring continued till October 2021 before CISA finally publicly announced it in November 2021.[26]\n\nAlso, the FANCY BEAR adversary associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special Services (Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate), was first identified as initially using extensively spear-phishing emails containing \"malicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure when conducting cyberattacks\"27 but thereafter reevaluated \"its operational tradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use of credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and victim-tailored phishing websites.\"28\n\nOver the years, the U.S. intelligence community and other cyber defenders have utilized different tools to identify the potential source of an attack in order to characterize it. These tools are used to understand the activities of the cyber threat actors which are useful for characterization purposes. These tools include intrusion detection systems (IDS), anomaly behavior detection tools, firewalls, IP addresses and forensic analysis of malware.[29] The Government Accountability Office (GAO), CISA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a threat table characterizing each form of attacks by different threat actors (the Threat Table).[30] The Threat Table, contained in the GAO's March 2021 High-Risk Series, characterizes the motivations by criminal groups, hackers and hacktivists, insiders, nations and terrorist in the following manner:\n\n18 Deborah Bodeau &amp; Richard Graubart, Characterizing Effects on the Cyber Adversary: A Vocabulary for Analysis and Assessment (2013) https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/characterizing-effects-cyber-adversary-13-4173.pdf.\n19 Cyberattacks as used in this paper include attacks targeted against U.S. critical infrastructure, companies and individuals.\n20 Kosmas Pipyros et al., A Cyber Attack Evaluation Methodology, in PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON CYBER WARFARE AND SECURITY (A.

Specifically, criminal groups use cyber exploits to commit identity theft, online fraud, and computer extortion.

Thus, a strict adherence to the Threat Table may be outdated. For instance, according to the GAO and DHS's estimation in the Threat Table, terrorist groups \"do not currently have the sophisticated tools or skill necessary to execute a cyberattack that could cause a widespread outage or significantly damage the power system.\"32 If an attack significantly causes damage to the system, from this characterization, terrorists may be removed from the equation. But this potentially poses two dangers. First, it can limit the cyber response necessary for an attack. Secondly, it may lead to an embarrassing situation, \"if and when it is proven to have originated from more benign—if not necessarily less ominous (in terms of consequences)—causes.\"33 The Microsoft's Digital Defence Report, 2021, for instance, reveals the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) deployed by States like Russia and China,34 which make it dangerous to abide strictly by the Threat Table in the characterization process. Microsoft reported that in many instances, attackers did not conceal their actions, but concealed their intentions.35 It was found that hackers, who according to the Threat Table, are characterized as driven by \"challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain\" were in fact, carrying out\n\ninformation gathering characterized as States' motivation under the Threat Table.[36]\n\nVery little has changed from the GAO's Threat Table since 2005.[37] Yet, cyber threat actors have continued to expand their operations in old and new ways.[38] Like criminal groups, Nation State actors, have \"moved toward targeting poorly configured or unpatched enterprise systems (VPN/VPS infrastructure, on-premises servers, third-party software) to perform living-off-the-land attacks.\"[39]\n\n# 3. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack attribution law and policy\n\nAttributing an attack to a particular source is one of the major challenges in cyberattack response.40 But to the ODNI, though difficult, it is not impossible.41 Just like characterization, there is also no clear international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks.42 Yet, international law, while it allows the use of force for self-defense,43 demands that such force must be directed against the attacker.44 Thus, to lawfully use a countermeasure in response to a cyberattack, the victim State must first attribute the attack to the perpetrator precisely.45\n\n36 Id. 114.\n37 To access the GAO's Threat Table, 2005, see Cyber Threat Source Description, Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, <https: am=\"\" content=\"\" cyber-threat-source-descriptions#nat=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" usr=\"\">.\n38 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, Microsoft, 2022, <https: am=\"\" content=\"\" gory.prod.cms=\"\" gory.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com=\"\" m=\"\" m:=\"\" petsbuvv?culture=\"en-us&amp;country=us\" uu=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.\n39 Id. at 32.\n40 Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 17(2) J.

The attackers used the U.S. domestic infrastructure, which made it more difficult to trace the source of the attack.53 Thus, it has been suggested that in the attribu\n\ntion process, \"who is to blame?\" can be more important than \"who did it?\".54\n\nNotwithstanding the preceding, the ODNI believes that all cyber operation leaves a trail.[55] Both the CTIC and private sector companies have developed tools to assist in making a precise attribution. Some of these include tradecraft, network traffic, computer log entries, malware collection, file timestamps, utilizing publicly available websites, blogs, and document repositories, among others.[56] Though, the availability of these artifacts does not, itself, guarantee a conclusive proof of the source of an attack.[57]\n\nThe cyber attributing body in the U.S. has transcended beyond the CTIC alone.[58] Now, private companies, notably, CrowdStrike,[59] FireEye,[60] Mandiant,[61] Microsoft,[62] among others, partake in attribution. For instance, in its 2022 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike reportd and attributed the activities of COZY BEAR to Russia. It noted that during its investigation, COZY BEAR operators used \"authentication cookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks.\"[63] Also, in its Digital Defense Report 2022, Microsoft made cyber attribution to States. Microsoft reported that it detected Russian network intrusion efforts against 128 organizations in 42 countries between February and June 2022 and that the U.S. was Russia's number one target.[64]\n\nAs for the CTIC, the DHS notes that there is generally no single agency that has \"the authorities, capabilities, and expertise to deal unilaterally with a significant cyber incident.\"[65] All the CTIC agencies work to complement the activities of each other. However, by the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive-United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD-41),[66] the DoJ, acting through the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), is the Federal lead agency for cyber threat response activities.[67] Attribution is listed as one of the cy\n\n46 Kristen Eichensehr, The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution, 67 UCLA L.

Nonetheless, from a complete reading of the PPD-41, the ODNI, DHS, and other CTIC agencies could contribute to the attribution analysis.\n\nInterestingly, under U.S. law, the Secretary to the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD) could also make attribution. By Executive Orders 13694⁶⁹ and 13757⁷⁰ (E.Os. 13694 and 13757), the property of any person attributed by the Secretary to the USTD, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to have conducted a cyberattack which constitutes a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the U.S., are blocked from transfer, exported, or withdrawn. The USTD, through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for instance, exercised its power under E.Os. 13694 and 13757 by blocking Park Jin Hyok's assets in 2018 after being linked to WannaCry.⁷¹ But as noted below, the lack of a single attributing agency calls for a change.\n\nThere are different attribution models which have been developed to aid the attribution process. A popular one is the Herbert Lin's model.⁷² The model adopts three levels in the attribution process, namely, machines, human operators, and the ultimate responsible party. The first level requires forensic investigation of machines. Here, logfiles and IP address may be examined to locate the source of the attack.⁷³ The second level requires identifying the specific individual responsible for the attack. Here, to Lin, forensics alone is not sufficient.⁷⁴ Investigators need to accumulate a set of clues – such as historical records, private online forum, authentication – to pin the attack on a specific individual.⁷⁵ The last level requires identifying the entity an attacker works for: It could be for a terrorist group, government or alone. Here, one way to make this determination would be to interview the attacker.⁷⁶ There is proof of usage of this model by private cybersecurity firms.⁷⁷ On its part, in using the Lin's model, there are different ways the CTIC agencies could achieve this. First, the CTIC agencies could leverage on the efforts of the private sector companies.⁷⁸ Second, the CTIC agencies could utilize some surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which allows surveillance for national security or foreign intelligence investigations against a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.⁷⁹\n\nAccording to the ODNI, the CTIC's attribution process is modeled after some key indicators: Tradecraft, infrastructure, malware, and intent,⁸⁰ with tradecraft the most important indicator in the attribution process because \"habits are more difficult to change than technical tools.\"⁸¹ While the ODNI's Guide to Cyber Attribution does not contain a layer of steps in the attribution process, the Guide contains all the Lin's tools. Apart from the Lin's Model, in complying with its international law obligation regarding attribution, the U.S. can also use both data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations and documentary evidence.⁸²\n\nCyber attribution is important, because without it, there would not be deterrence for cyber attackers.⁸³ The U.S. attribution policies are modeled to achieve three goals, namely, public attribution; indictment; and sanction.⁸⁴ Public attribution involves publicly naming a threat actor as the attacker.⁸⁵ The principal aim of this approach is to publicly name and shame an attacker, especially States, with the view that the embarrassment from the naming and shaming, would deter the attacker from conducting another cyberattack.⁸⁶ CTIC, especially CISA through its alert system,⁸⁷ and private companies, have adopted this method. Sanctions and indictments have also been used by the U.S. government in concert with public attribution.⁸⁸\n\nIt is, however, generally agreed within the cyber community that the trio of public attribution, sanctions, and indictments, are not sufficient in achieving the attribution goal.⁸⁹ This is true, considering that from the various recent reports by the CTIC and private sector companies, cyber threat actors continue to conduct cyberattacks against the U.S., despite public attributions, sanctions, and indictments against cyber attackers. Further, another gap in the U.S. laws and policies for attribution is the lack of a definitive standard of proof required to make attribution.⁹⁰ Generally, it is extremely difficult in the attribution process to be almost certain about the source of a\n\n⁶⁸ Id.\n\n⁶⁹ Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Orders 13694 of April 1, 2015, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities.\n\n⁷⁰ Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/cyber2_eo.pdf.\n\n⁷¹ DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Press Release: Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks, U.S. (Sept. 6, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm473.\n\n⁷² Lin, supra note 57.\n\n⁷³ Id. at 81.\n\n⁷⁴ Id. at 84.\n\n⁷⁵ Id.\n\n⁷⁶ Id. at 86-7\n\n⁷⁷ Milton Mueller, Karl Grindal, Brenden Kuerbis &amp; Farzaneh Badiei, Cyber Attribution: Can a New Institution Achieve Transnational Credibility? 4(1) THE CYBER DEFENSE REV. 107, 108 (2019).\n\n⁷⁸ Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 49.\n\n⁷⁹ Lin, supra note 57, at 17.\n\n⁸⁰ A Guide to Cyber Attribution, supra note 41, at 3.\n\n⁸¹ Id.\n\n⁸² Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Muchael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31(3) EUR.

Yet, in order to effectively respond to a cyberattack – particularly under international law – attribution must first be made by the States.⁹¹\n\nThis attribution challenge is not exclusively a U.S. problem. This is a problem faced in all jurisdictions.⁹² More problematic is that international law does not provide a definite guide.⁹³ International law has been accused of failing to “set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution.”⁹⁴ Varying degrees of standards of proof have been laid by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for determining State responsibility under international law.⁹⁵ The ICJ at various times has required exceptional gravity, fully conclusive and clear and convincing standard of proofs.⁹⁶ Scholars believe that it is because of a lack of a single standard by the ICJ that the “Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be determined by the relevant forum.”⁹⁷\n\nAlthough scholars have clamored for a solution to the foregoing problem, “yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism.”⁹⁸ Notwithstanding, eminent international law scholars have attempted to provide an international law standard for attribution of cyberattack. For instance, where the cyberattack is less serious, Tsagourias and Farrell argue that “preponderance of the evidence” is the most appropriate standard.⁹⁹ They reasoned that both a very high standard, such as “beyond a reasonable doubt” and a low standard, may not ensure a balance.¹⁰⁰ But where the attack is a cyberwar,¹⁰¹ and the victim State intends\n\nto respond with the use of force, Finlay and Payne, suggest the use of “a strict test of attribution.”¹⁰² Importantly, international law does not – and cannot – require absolute certainty in attribution.¹⁰³ But it requires reasonability.¹⁰⁴ For this reason, convincing circumstantial proof standard, is said to be sufficient.¹⁰⁵ Most of the attribution made by the CTIC agencies and private sector, appears to adopt this standard, using the Lin’s model and the ODNI’s indicators.¹⁰⁶\n\nThere are many areas for improvement that appear from the U.S. cyberattack attribution policies and process described above. First, there is a lack of a single attributing agency. The danger with this is the potential disagreement in evidence gathering and attributing standards amongst the different CTIC agencies.¹⁰⁷ One Bill – the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018 (CDRA) – currently pending before the Congress, which aims to “address state-sponsored cyber activities against the United States, and for other purpose,”¹⁰⁸ rather than address the problem, compounds it by adding the President to the list of those who can attribute. By section 3(1), the President, acting through the Secretary of State, and in coordination with other relevant Federal agency heads, shall make attribution. The Bill does not designate a single Federal agency for attribution.\n\nSecond, there is no known procedure for making attribution. The CDRA also falls short of laying down any procedure. The danger here is that the absence of a known procedure affects the transparency, the due process of identifying the attacker and “could hamper the credibility of attribution more broadly.”¹⁰⁹ Such absence is also susceptible to the use of unjustifiable countermeasure and self-defense under international law. Under international law, while Article 51 of the UN Charter codifies the customary international law right of a State to use self-defense if faced with an armed attack,¹¹⁰ such State must do so within clearly established principles, otherwise, it will become the aggressor.¹¹¹\n\nThird, the lack of a standardized procedure coupled with the participation of the private sector in attribution freely, is a cause for concern. Private entities like CrowdStrike, FireEye, Mandiant, SecureWork and Microsoft, have all released reports attributing cyberattacks to different threat actors, including States/State-sponsored entities. The potential dangers here are: First, there could be potential contradiction – where the CTIC could reach a different conclusion as to the source of an attack, while the private sector entities reach another.¹¹² Second, there could be an interference with an on-\n\n⁹¹ Eichensehr, supra note 52, at 3.\n⁹² See for instance, Annegret Bendiek &amp; Matthias Schulze, Attribution: A Major Challenge for EU Cyber Sanctions: An Analysis of WannaCry, NotPetya, Cloud Hopper, Bundestag Hack and the Attack on the OPCW, SWP Research Paper 11 (2021).\n⁹³ For discussion, see Tsagourias &amp; Farrell, supra note 82, at 965 (stating that “current attribution claims do not rely on any particular standard of proof and that international law is quite ambiguous in this regard.”).

But there can be no effective deterrence without adequate attribution.¹¹⁶ Hence, the issues associated with attribution – difficulty, time and lack of a process – have invariably prevented achieving an effective retaliation.¹¹⁷\n\n## 4. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation law and policy\n\nA State that has faced a cyberattack has varying options – both under its domestic legal system and international law – in retaliating the attack. For instance, under international law, there are typically four options available to the victim State: Self-defense, countermeasures, the plea of necessity, and retorsion.¹¹⁸ But the threshold required before using any of these options is fuzzy.¹¹⁹ It is, however, clear that the self-defense option is only available when a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or “use of force.”¹²⁰\n\nThere are a lot of scholarships on the applicability of international law principles on use of force to a situation where a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or use of force.¹²¹ But as conceptualized in this paper, a cyberattack does not escalate to the level of an armed attack.¹²² “To date,” state Finlay and Payne, “few if any of the known cyberattacks appear to meet the threshold for a ‘use of force,’ let alone for an ‘armed attack.’”¹²³ In this situation – that is, where it is\n\na cyberattack and not a cyberwar – international law scholars are divided on the implications of this under international law.¹²⁴ Notwithstanding, the impacts of cyberattacks – even if it falls short of an armed attack or use of force – can be significant.¹²⁵ Therefore, cyberattack by its nature, violates the principles of non-intervention¹²⁶ and sovereignty under international law.¹²⁷ Hathaway, et al. provide a list of four other legal regimes that could regulate retaliation for cyberattacks, even if cyberattacks do not constitute an armed attack or use of force (cyberwar).¹²⁸ This paper critiques the fourth legal regime – the U.S. domestic law and policy.\n\nThe U.S. cyber retaliation policies are not contained in a single policy document. There are several documents stipulating the goal of cyber retaliation, but none contains specific retaliation steps nor a set of retaliatory actions. The U.S. has consistently maintained that its aim in retaliating is to pass a message to cyber attackers “that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.”¹²⁹ The U.S. cyber retaliation policies can be aggregated from its National Security Strategy, DoD Zero Trust Strategy, White House Statements, and the International Cyber Strategy. Some of the retaliation policies also appear in the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report. These are considered serially. First, the 2022 National Security Strategy states the aim of retaliation for cyberattack thus:\n\n“We aim to deter cyberattacks from state and non-state actors and will respond decisively with all appropriate tools of national power to hostile acts in cyberspace, including those that disrupt or degrade vital national functions or critical infrastructure. We will continue to promote adherence to the UN General Assembly-endorsed framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, which recognizes that international law applies online, just as it does offline.”¹³⁰\n\nIn the 2022 National Security Strategy, the U.S. states that it will adopt “Integrated Deterrence” in achieving its retaliation objectives.¹³¹ Integrated Deterrence recognizes that\n\n¹¹³ Id. at 479-80.\n¹¹⁴ Id. at 479.\n¹¹⁵ Id.\n¹¹⁶ See Clara Assumpção, The Problem of Cyber Attribution Between States 1 (2020) https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/83271 (stating that “attributing responsibility to who perpetrated an attack against a state and, even more importantly, who ordered it, is a way to achieve cyber deterrence”).\n¹¹⁷ Chris Jakaran, Cybersecurity: Deterrence Policy, (2022) Congressional Research Service 47011.\n¹¹⁸ Schmitt, supra note 45, at 244.\n¹¹⁹ Id.\n¹²⁰ Finlay &amp; Payne, supra note 93, at 202.\n¹²¹ See for instance, Michael N.

According to the Strategy, Integrated Deterrence entails five integrations. First, integration across domains, which recognizes that cyber threat actors operate across \"military (land, air, maritime, cyber, and space) and non-military (economic, technological, and information) domains—and that we must too.\"132 Second, integration across regions, which entails an understanding that cyber threat actors \"combine expansive ambitions with growing capabilities to threaten U.S. interests in key regions and in the homeland.\"133 Third, integration across the spectrum of conflict which aims \"to prevent cyber threat actors from altering the status quo in ways that harm U.S. vital interests while hovering below the threshold of armed conflict.\"134 The Strategy also entails integration across the U.S. Government; and integration with allies and partners.135 The Strategy states that Integrated Deterrence \"requires us to more effectively coordinate, network, and innovate so that any competitor thinking about pressing for advantage in one domain understands that we can respond in many others as well. This augments the traditional backstop of combat-credible conventional and strategic capabilities.\"136 The Strategy, however, does not contain specific retaliation steps nor set of retaliatory actions.\n\nSecond, some statements from the White House contain some of the retaliation policies. The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cybersecurity, for instance, aims to \"lock our digital doors\" and \"take aggressive action to strengthen and safeguard our nation's cybersecurity, including imposing costs on and strengthening our security against malicious actors.\"137 The Statement mentions the sanctioning of Russian cyber actors affiliated with the Russian intelligence services in response to the SolarWinds attack. It also mentions the imposition of cost against Iran for its counter-normative attack on Albanian government systems.138 Thus, the Statement mentions two retaliation options the U.S. resorts to as response to a cyberattack: Sanction and cost. But the Statement is not comprehensive, nor does it define when either of the retaliation options would be resorted to.\n\nThird, under the International Cyber Strategy, 2011, there are four steps preparatory to retaliation. They are (1) the U.S. will participate fully in international cybercrime policy development; (2) Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to the Budapest Convention; (3) Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the internet; and (4) Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the internet for operational planning, financing, or attacks.139 The Strategy develops three\n\nmodels: development, diplomacy and defense  $(\\mathrm{D}_3)$ . Where an attack occurs from a non-State threat actors, the retaliation includes investigation, apprehension, and prosecution.140 The Strategy further provides that when warranted, the U.S. will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace like any other threat. But before doing so, the U.S. would exhaust all other options, like weighing the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction. Where the U.S. resorts to the use of military force, it would categorize this as self-defense, and could compel actions under its military treaties with other countries.141 Where it gets to this, the U.S. could \"use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\"142 While the Strategy mentions the retaliatory actions, they are not clearly defined.\n\nFourth, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report, 2020 (CSC Report), also contains some of the U.S. retaliation policies and recommends some. The CSC Report establishes the \"layered cyber deterrence.\"143 Under this structure, the U.S. must shape the behavior in cyberspace; the U.S. must deny benefits to the cyber threat actors; and the U.S. must impose costs as retaliation for cyberattacks.144 The CSC Report also makes some recommendations with respect to retaliation. It recommends that the U.S. \"announce a second declaratory policy which would clearly state that the U.S. would respond using cyber and non-cyber capabilities to counter and impose costs\" against cyber threat actors \"below a use-of-force threshold.\"145 It also recommends that the U.S. government should \"publicly declare that it will defend forward, and couple its declaration with decisive and consistent action.\"146 According to the CSC Report, defend forward \"posits that to disrupt and defeat ongoing adversary campaigns, the United States must proactively observe, pursue, and counter adversaries' operations and impose costs short of armed conflict.\"147 The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cyber appears to be one of such public declaration. But as stated above, the Statement is not comprehensive.\n\nMuch of the criticisms on the U.S. cyber retaliation policies relate to its lack of preciseness. Preciseness is important for two reasons: First, it informs cyber threat actors of the actions that would be taken in retaliation for a cyberattack; and secondly, it encourages public debates among citizens to critique the retaliation actions sought to be taken against cyber threat actors.148 Another criticism is that the current retaliation options used by the U.S. are not sufficient, as they have not deterred cyberattacks.149 For this, some cyber experts have\n\n132 Id.\n133 Id.\n134 Id.\n135 Id.\n136 Id.\n137 THE WHITE HOUSE, Fact Sheet: Biden- Harris Administration Delivers on Strengthening America's Cybersecurity, October 11, 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-delivers-on-strengthening-americas-cybersecurity/.\n138 Id.\n139 International Strategy for Cyberspace, supra note 129, at 19-20.\n\n140 Id at 13.\n141 Id at 14.\n142 Id.\n143 Cyberspace Solarium Commission, Final Report, March 2020, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view\n144 Id. at 1.\n145 Id. at 34.\n146 Id.\n147 Id.\n148 Jakaran, supra note 117, at 10.\n149 Nathaniel Fick et al.

Yannakogeorgos, building on Healey's taxonomy, developed the below retaliation framework for State/State-sponsored attack:[150]\n\n|  Range of state activity | Development | Diplomacy | Defense  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  State prohibited | X |  |   |\n|  State prohibited but inadequate | X |  |   |\n|  State ignored | X | X |   |\n|  State encouraged |  | X |   |\n|  State shaped |  | X |   |\n|  State coordinated |  | X |   |\n|  State ordered |  |  | X  |\n|  State-rogue conducted |  |  | X  |\n|  State executed |  |  | X  |\n|  State integrated |  |  | X  |\n\nSource: Yannakogeorgos (2016) 'Strategy for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,' p. 55.\n\nThe above retaliation framework while useful, are not adhered to by the U.S. government in retaliation. Although, there are times when part of this framework has been adopted, one of the other criticisms of the U.S. cyber retaliation laws and policies is that the U.S. government is inconsistent in its application. Despite the several documents stipulating the U.S. cyber retaliation options, none contains specific retaliation steps. And despite these several documents, the U.S. continues to experience an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks. Law and policy recommendations addressing this will, thus, improve the retaliation policies.\n\n# 5. Law and policy recommendations\n\nIn this part, some law and policy recommendations on the gaps and criticisms identified above will be made.\n\n1. Law and Policy Recommendation for Characterization:\n\nA. Conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks to understand the current motivations for each TTPs. The actors for this should be the USCYBERCOM, FBI, CISA and DHS + private sector. This would encourage information sharing amongst the CTIC and the private sector. It would also lead to a faster and easier characterization process. With it, the CTIC would be able to quickly characterize a malfunction in the computer system or critical infrastructure as a cyberattack with the detection of the TTPs.\nB. Constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks. The actors for this should be the GAO, CISA and DHS. These actors should also work with the private sector in this regard. For instance, CrowdStrike's Threat Activity Table in its 2022 Report, includes \"generating currency to support a regime\" as\n\npart of the motivations for a State attack. $^{151}$  This recommendation is important because it would reflect the dynamics and changing nature of the motivations for cyberattacks. It would also assist with the appropriate cyber response and defense.\n\nC. Develop a joint characterization guideline (JCG) for cyberattacks. The recommended actors for this are CISA, DoJ, FBI and DHS. In the guideline, a rigid characterization description should be avoided. The JCG should be revised annually (or as appropriate, for instance, where a cyberattack necessitates the need to change something substantial). The JCG should avoid definitive characterization of an attack before a full-scale investigation. This recommendation is necessary to have a standardized approach for characterization. It would make the characterization process tidier.\n\n2. Law and Policy Recommendation for Attribution:\n\nA. Amend the CDRA before enactment. The actor for this is the Congress. The scope of the CDRA should be extended to cover other threat actors. The extant CDRA Bill deals with \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" However, majority of the cyberattacks against the U.S. are conducted by non-State threat actors.[152] The CDRA should create a body - The National Cyber Investigative Agency (NCIA) - and clothes it with the power to attribute to other cyber threat actors (other than State/State-sponsored actors) without the need for the President to make such attribution. The rationale for this law and policy is that the extant CDRA Bill covers only \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" It excludes cyberattacks by other cyber threat actors, who are equally a major threat. This recommendation would expand the scope of the CDRA to cover these other cyber threat actors. Also, under the CDRA, the President is empowered to make attribution for the \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" This recommendation recognizes that given the number of cyberattacks against the U.S. annually, the functionality of attributing all cyberattacks (when the scope of the CDRA is expanded) by the President is not feasible. This recommendation posits that the NCIA should instead, be tasked with attribution of other cyber threat actors.\nB. Designate the attribution function to a single agency - The NCIA. This recommendation may be done by the Congress through legislation (the CDRA could create the NCIA) or President through Executive Orders. One agency that may be reconstituted to the NCIA as an independent agency is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force.[153] All the CTIC agencies should",

Only the NCIA should have the power to ultimately publicly attribute, though other CTIC agencies might publicize the attribution with the permission of NCIA. Also, the USTD should act on the attribution made by NCIA in blocking assets. In addition, the NCIA should be the advisory agency to the President in attributing cyberattacks to a State. The rationale for this recommendation is that in recent years, private sectors companies participate in the attributing of cyberattacks. As noted above in the Sony data beach and Olympic Destroyer attack, a lack of a coordinated attribution process may lead to contradictory attributions. This recommendation is aimed at addressing this. Also, this recommendation is apt to save cost and time in the attribution process. When a single agency (like the NCIA) is tasked with attribution, the cost and time expended by other CTIC agencies in attribution when aggregated will be reduced.\n2. Develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline (CAG). The NCIA should do this after its establishment. The CAG should stipulate the procedure for attribution. This would increase the transparency and credibility of the attribution process (due process). The CAG should also stipulate the requirements for private sector companies to make public attribution to States. It should require private sector companies to check with the NCIA before making public attributions to States/State-sponsored cyberattacks. The CAG may permit private sector companies to publicly make attribution with respect to other threat actors without consulting the NCIA. The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) should be under the NCIA. The rationale for this recommendation is that the JCDC was recently convened by the CISA to facilitate the relationship between the CTIC agencies and private sector companies in the attribution process.154 An effective collaboration between the public/private sectors requires a flexible terrain for the private sector.155 This recommendation posits that the CAG should be a document which clearly defines the assistance available to the private sector companies from the NCIA and other CTIC agencies in the attribution process.\n3. Law and Policy Recommendation on Retaliation\n\n1. Develop a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks. This may be done by the Congress through legislation; the President through Executive Orders or the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). The C_{3}RT would inform potential cyber threat actors the consequences of carrying out cyberattacks against the U.S. To be effective, the U.S. should strictly abide by it in retaliating. The C_{3}RT should contain very strict punishments for cyber threat actors. It should factor the range of State activity in the Yannako-georgos and Healey's retaliation framework in setting the severity of the retaliation. The EU has adopted this method through its “Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox.”156\n2. Develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES). The ONCD should be the lead actor for this. The ONCD should work on updating the National Cyber Strategy, 2018 as per its enabling statute -- the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.157 The National Cyber Strategy should contain the enforcement strategy. The C_{2}ES should include steps to strengthen the existing relationship with the EU and other U.S. allies. The C_{2}ES may build on the D_{3} of the International Cyber Strategy, 2011.\n3. Introduce new retaliatory actions in the C_{3}RT beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment. This could include hack-back in case the cyberattack is by a State/State-sponsored.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper considers three of the most important questions in responding to cyberattacks. These are characterization, attribution, and retaliation. It found that the U.S. characterization process is not clear, nor is there an international framework for characterization. The paper however, found that the GOA Threat Table, 2021, characterizes the motivations by cyber threat actors in carrying out cyberattacks. This table is not so much different from the GAO's Threat Table, 2005. Yet, recent studies reveal that cyber threat actors constantly change their TTP and could conceal their true motivation, in order to prevent the U.S. from appropriately responding to a cyberattack. To address this problem, the paper thus, recommends three things: (1) the CTIC should conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks; (2) the CTIC should constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks; and (3) a JCG for cyberattacks should be developed. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a clear attribution procedure. There is also no single agency with the power to attribute, with virtually all the CTIC agencies having the power to attribute. Also, private sector companies participate freely in attribution. The paper discusses the dangers with these and makes three recommendations: (1) the CDRA should be amended before enactment to extend its scope to cover other cyber threat actors; (2) the attribution function should be designated a single agency -- the NCIA; and (3) the NCIA should develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline which will set forth the requirements",

Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response.\n© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n# 1. Introduction\nThe definition of the term \"cyberattack,\" though, contained in different scholarly works, $^{1}$  is often equated to a lesser form, called \"cybercrime,\" and a more intense form, called \"cyber\nwar.\" The most prominent definition of cyberattack describes it as an attack initiated from a computer against a website, computer system or critical infrastructure, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the attacked computer or information stored on it. The Department of Defense (DoD) adopted the following comprehensive\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105847\n0267-3649/© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The intended effects of cyberattacks are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyberattack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyberattack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.⁴\nWhen carried out, it aims to disrupt, disable, destroy, interfere, steal or control the data, information and functionality of the attacked computer or critical infrastructure.⁵ Generally, these attacks may be carried out by individuals, acting alone, or with others; terrorist organizations; non-state actors working for a State; or by State agencies⁶ – a prominent example of which was Russia's interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election using series of cyberattacks coordinated by State agencies.⁷\nCyberattacks have taken different spectrums over the years, and the U.S. defense agencies have identified them. These include Network Denial, Enterprise Denial, Enterprise Manipulation, Mission Denial, and Mission Manipulation.⁸ The methods of carrying out cyberattacks are numerous. A consideration of these methods is outside the scope of this paper. But they deserve mention:\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Phishing attacks\n- Drive-by-download attack\n- Password Attack\n- SQL Injection Attack\n- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\n- Eavesdropping attack\nThis paper focuses on cyberattack, as distinguished from cybercrime and cyberwar. One of the best efforts showing the distinction amongst the concepts of cyberattack, cybercrime and cyberwar is that of Hathaway et al. in the paper, The Law of Cyber-Attack. To the authors, a cyberattack is “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.”¹⁰ To this end, any attack that is “not carried out for a political or national security purpose, such as most instances of internet fraud, identity theft, and intellectual property piracy, does not fit this final element of a “cyberattack” and is therefore mere cyber-crime.”¹¹\nAlso, cyberattacks are distinguishable from cyberwar. To Hathaway et al., ‘cyber-warfare’ is... a term properly used only to refer to the small subset of cyber-attacks that do constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict.¹² From this distinction, a cyberattack may not constitute an armed attack under international law and thus, the retaliation to it is expected to fall short of an armed response.¹³ Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, attacks on any of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by the Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21)¹⁴ and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which though, do not have an effects equivalent to an “armed attack,” are classified as cyberattacks.¹⁵ This is because attacks on critical infrastructures pose a national security challenge as it may be injurious to both the people and the environment – for instance, the hacking of a critical infrastructure which releases toxic substance.¹⁶ According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the U.S. experienced an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks in 2021, with the critical infrastructures a major target.¹⁷\n⁴ DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, Memorandum for Chiefs of the Military Services, Commanders of the Combatant Commands and Directors of the Joint Staff Directorates (2011) https://info.publicintelligence.net/DoD-JointCyberTerms.pdf.\n⁵ Michael Power, Michael Pease, Keith Stouffer, CheeYee Tang, Timothy Zimmerman, Joseph Brule, et al.

Cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation, are related in some way. For instance, some scholars have classified characterization as part of the attribution process and to them, characterization is the attribution of cyberattacks to classes of adversaries.[18] These three processes are necessary in responding to cyberattacks and developing a robust cyber defense system.[19]\nThis paper is divided into six sections. After this introduction, Section 2 will focus on the U.S. characterization policies. Section 3 deals with attribution policies of cyberattacks against the U.S. Section 4 discusses the retaliation policies for cyberattacks against the U.S. The paper seeks to synthesize and answer the unanswered law and policy questions on characterization, attribution, and retaliation. To this end, the paper will critique the existing U.S. laws and policies on cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation. Section 5 will recommend laws and policies to address the identified gaps. Section 6 – the conclusion – will summarize the paper.\n# 2. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack characterization law and policy\nThe characterization process for cyberattacks by the U.S. intelligence and military agencies is not clear. There is equally no international standard for characterization.[20] In simple terms, characterization means the interpretation given to the abnormality that occurs to the proper functioning of a computer system.[21] Generally, the proper functioning of a computer system may be disrupted for different reasons, such as, human error, natural events or it may be deliberate (an attack). Where it is an attack, characterization is usually determined by the extent of the consequences of the attack.[22] Characterization is important in the response process for two main reasons. First, it shapes how to respond to the cyberattack. For instance, where it is determined that the attack is malicious, characterization will help in the deployment of appropriate response. Secondly, characterization is important to strengthen the cyber defense.[23]\nAn attack may be characterized in different ways: It may be for financial gains; for espionage; for service disruption; shaming; information gathering, among other. To characterize, the U.S. cyber threat intelligence community (CTIC)[24] and private sector companies, as a preliminary step, usually identify the potential source of the attack in order to monitor and determine how to respond to such attack. This has proved difficult, as the U.S. has continued to research the blueprints of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors, (that is, highly motivated, sophisticated, and organized threat groups).[25] For instance, between March and October 2021, the CTIC monitored Iranian government-sponsored APT actors. In March 2021, the FBI and CISA first observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors leverage Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet vulnerabilities to target a broad range of victims across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in furtherance of malicious activities. The monitoring continued till October 2021 before CISA finally publicly announced it in November 2021.[26]\nAlso, the FANCY BEAR adversary associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special Services (Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate), was first identified as initially using extensively spear-phishing emails containing \"malicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure when conducting cyberattacks\"27 but thereafter reevaluated \"its operational tradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use of credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and victim-tailored phishing websites.\"28\nOver the years, the U.S. intelligence community and other cyber defenders have utilized different tools to identify the potential source of an attack in order to characterize it. These tools are used to understand the activities of the cyber threat actors which are useful for characterization purposes. These tools include intrusion detection systems (IDS), anomaly behavior detection tools, firewalls, IP addresses and forensic analysis of malware.[29] The Government Accountability Office (GAO), CISA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a threat table characterizing each form of attacks by different threat actors (the Threat Table).[30] The Threat Table, contained in the GAO's March 2021 High-Risk Series, characterizes the motivations by criminal groups, hackers and hacktivists, insiders, nations and terrorist in the following manner:\n18 Deborah Bodeau &amp; Richard Graubart, Characterizing Effects on the Cyber Adversary: A Vocabulary for Analysis and Assessment (2013) https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/characterizing-effects-cyber-adversary-13-4173.pdf.\n19 Cyberattacks as used in this paper include attacks targeted against U.S. critical infrastructure, companies and individuals.\n20 Kosmas Pipyros et al., A Cyber Attack Evaluation Methodology, in PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON CYBER WARFARE AND SECURITY (A.

By contrast, hacktivists are ideologically motivated actors who use cyber exploits to further political goals.  |\n|  Nation | Nations, including groups or programs sponsored or sanctioned by nation-states, use cyber tools as part of their information gathering and espionage activities.  |\n|  Terrorist | Terrorists seek to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit critical infrastructures in order to threaten national security, cause mass casualties, weaken the economy, and damage public morale and confidence.  |\n|  Source: GAO-21-288.31  |   |\nWhile generally, the Threat Table is an important tool in characterization, recent activities of cyber threat actors show that these actors do not necessarily conduct cyberattacks in accordance with the descriptions in the Threat Table. Thus, a strict adherence to the Threat Table may be outdated. For instance, according to the GAO and DHS's estimation in the Threat Table, terrorist groups \"do not currently have the sophisticated tools or skill necessary to execute a cyberattack that could cause a widespread outage or significantly damage the power system.\"32 If an attack significantly causes damage to the system, from this characterization, terrorists may be removed from the equation. But this potentially poses two dangers. First, it can limit the cyber response necessary for an attack. Secondly, it may lead to an embarrassing situation, \"if and when it is proven to have originated from more benign—if not necessarily less ominous (in terms of consequences)—causes.\"33 The Microsoft's Digital Defence Report, 2021, for instance, reveals the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) deployed by States like Russia and China,34 which make it dangerous to abide strictly by the Threat Table in the characterization process. Microsoft reported that in many instances, attackers did not conceal their actions, but concealed their intentions.35 It was found that hackers, who according to the Threat Table, are characterized as driven by \"challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain\" were in fact, carrying out\ninformation gathering characterized as States' motivation under the Threat Table.[36]\nVery little has changed from the GAO's Threat Table since 2005.[37] Yet, cyber threat actors have continued to expand their operations in old and new ways.[38] Like criminal groups, Nation State actors, have \"moved toward targeting poorly configured or unpatched enterprise systems (VPN/VPS infrastructure, on-premises servers, third-party software) to perform living-off-the-land attacks.\"[39]\n# 3. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack attribution law and policy\nAttributing an attack to a particular source is one of the major challenges in cyberattack response.40 But to the ODNI, though difficult, it is not impossible.41 Just like characterization, there is also no clear international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks.42 Yet, international law, while it allows the use of force for self-defense,43 demands that such force must be directed against the attacker.44 Thus, to lawfully use a countermeasure in response to a cyberattack, the victim State must first attribute the attack to the perpetrator precisely.45\n36 Id. 114.\n37 To access the GAO's Threat Table, 2005, see Cyber Threat Source Description, Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, <https: am=\"\" content=\"\" cyber-threat-source-descriptions#nat=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" usr=\"\">.\n38 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, Microsoft, 2022, <https: am=\"\" content=\"\" gory.prod.cms=\"\" gory.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com=\"\" m=\"\" m:=\"\" petsbuvv?culture=\"en-us&amp;country=us\" uu=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.\n39 Id. at 32.\n40 Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 17(2) J.

The attackers used the U.S. domestic infrastructure, which made it more difficult to trace the source of the attack.53 Thus, it has been suggested that in the attribu\ntion process, \"who is to blame?\" can be more important than \"who did it?\".54\nNotwithstanding the preceding, the ODNI believes that all cyber operation leaves a trail.[55] Both the CTIC and private sector companies have developed tools to assist in making a precise attribution. Some of these include tradecraft, network traffic, computer log entries, malware collection, file timestamps, utilizing publicly available websites, blogs, and document repositories, among others.[56] Though, the availability of these artifacts does not, itself, guarantee a conclusive proof of the source of an attack.[57]\nThe cyber attributing body in the U.S. has transcended beyond the CTIC alone.[58] Now, private companies, notably, CrowdStrike,[59] FireEye,[60] Mandiant,[61] Microsoft,[62] among others, partake in attribution. For instance, in its 2022 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike reportd and attributed the activities of COZY BEAR to Russia. It noted that during its investigation, COZY BEAR operators used \"authentication cookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks.\"[63] Also, in its Digital Defense Report 2022, Microsoft made cyber attribution to States. Microsoft reported that it detected Russian network intrusion efforts against 128 organizations in 42 countries between February and June 2022 and that the U.S. was Russia's number one target.[64]\nAs for the CTIC, the DHS notes that there is generally no single agency that has \"the authorities, capabilities, and expertise to deal unilaterally with a significant cyber incident.\"[65] All the CTIC agencies work to complement the activities of each other. However, by the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive-United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD-41),[66] the DoJ, acting through the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), is the Federal lead agency for cyber threat response activities.[67] Attribution is listed as one of the cy\n46 Kristen Eichensehr, The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution, 67 UCLA L.

Nonetheless, from a complete reading of the PPD-41, the ODNI, DHS, and other CTIC agencies could contribute to the attribution analysis.\nInterestingly, under U.S. law, the Secretary to the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD) could also make attribution. By Executive Orders 13694⁶⁹ and 13757⁷⁰ (E.Os. 13694 and 13757), the property of any person attributed by the Secretary to the USTD, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to have conducted a cyberattack which constitutes a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the U.S., are blocked from transfer, exported, or withdrawn. The USTD, through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for instance, exercised its power under E.Os. 13694 and 13757 by blocking Park Jin Hyok's assets in 2018 after being linked to WannaCry.⁷¹ But as noted below, the lack of a single attributing agency calls for a change.\nThere are different attribution models which have been developed to aid the attribution process. A popular one is the Herbert Lin's model.⁷² The model adopts three levels in the attribution process, namely, machines, human operators, and the ultimate responsible party. The first level requires forensic investigation of machines. Here, logfiles and IP address may be examined to locate the source of the attack.⁷³ The second level requires identifying the specific individual responsible for the attack. Here, to Lin, forensics alone is not sufficient.⁷⁴ Investigators need to accumulate a set of clues – such as historical records, private online forum, authentication – to pin the attack on a specific individual.⁷⁵ The last level requires identifying the entity an attacker works for: It could be for a terrorist group, government or alone. Here, one way to make this determination would be to interview the attacker.⁷⁶ There is proof of usage of this model by private cybersecurity firms.⁷⁷ On its part, in using the Lin's model, there are different ways the CTIC agencies could achieve this. First, the CTIC agencies could leverage on the efforts of the private sector companies.⁷⁸ Second, the CTIC agencies could utilize some surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which allows surveillance for national security or foreign intelligence investigations against a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.⁷⁹\nAccording to the ODNI, the CTIC's attribution process is modeled after some key indicators: Tradecraft, infrastructure, malware, and intent,⁸⁰ with tradecraft the most important indicator in the attribution process because \"habits are more difficult to change than technical tools.\"⁸¹ While the ODNI's Guide to Cyber Attribution does not contain a layer of steps in the attribution process, the Guide contains all the Lin's tools. Apart from the Lin's Model, in complying with its international law obligation regarding attribution, the U.S. can also use both data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations and documentary evidence.⁸²\nCyber attribution is important, because without it, there would not be deterrence for cyber attackers.⁸³ The U.S. attribution policies are modeled to achieve three goals, namely, public attribution; indictment; and sanction.⁸⁴ Public attribution involves publicly naming a threat actor as the attacker.⁸⁵ The principal aim of this approach is to publicly name and shame an attacker, especially States, with the view that the embarrassment from the naming and shaming, would deter the attacker from conducting another cyberattack.⁸⁶ CTIC, especially CISA through its alert system,⁸⁷ and private companies, have adopted this method. Sanctions and indictments have also been used by the U.S. government in concert with public attribution.⁸⁸\nIt is, however, generally agreed within the cyber community that the trio of public attribution, sanctions, and indictments, are not sufficient in achieving the attribution goal.⁸⁹ This is true, considering that from the various recent reports by the CTIC and private sector companies, cyber threat actors continue to conduct cyberattacks against the U.S., despite public attributions, sanctions, and indictments against cyber attackers. Further, another gap in the U.S. laws and policies for attribution is the lack of a definitive standard of proof required to make attribution.⁹⁰ Generally, it is extremely difficult in the attribution process to be almost certain about the source of a\n⁶⁸ Id.\n⁶⁹ Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Orders 13694 of April 1, 2015, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities.\n⁷⁰ Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/cyber2_eo.pdf.\n⁷¹ DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Press Release: Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks, U.S. (Sept. 6, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm473.\n⁷² Lin, supra note 57.\n⁷³ Id. at 81.\n⁷⁴ Id. at 84.\n⁷⁵ Id.\n⁷⁶ Id. at 86-7\n⁷⁷ Milton Mueller, Karl Grindal, Brenden Kuerbis &amp; Farzaneh Badiei, Cyber Attribution: Can a New Institution Achieve Transnational Credibility? 4(1) THE CYBER DEFENSE REV. 107, 108 (2019).\n⁷⁸ Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 49.\n⁷⁹ Lin, supra note 57, at 17.\n⁸⁰ A Guide to Cyber Attribution, supra note 41, at 3.\n⁸¹ Id.\n⁸² Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Muchael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31(3) EUR.

Yet, in order to effectively respond to a cyberattack – particularly under international law – attribution must first be made by the States.⁹¹\nThis attribution challenge is not exclusively a U.S. problem. This is a problem faced in all jurisdictions.⁹² More problematic is that international law does not provide a definite guide.⁹³ International law has been accused of failing to “set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution.”⁹⁴ Varying degrees of standards of proof have been laid by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for determining State responsibility under international law.⁹⁵ The ICJ at various times has required exceptional gravity, fully conclusive and clear and convincing standard of proofs.⁹⁶ Scholars believe that it is because of a lack of a single standard by the ICJ that the “Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be determined by the relevant forum.”⁹⁷\nAlthough scholars have clamored for a solution to the foregoing problem, “yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism.”⁹⁸ Notwithstanding, eminent international law scholars have attempted to provide an international law standard for attribution of cyberattack. For instance, where the cyberattack is less serious, Tsagourias and Farrell argue that “preponderance of the evidence” is the most appropriate standard.⁹⁹ They reasoned that both a very high standard, such as “beyond a reasonable doubt” and a low standard, may not ensure a balance.¹⁰⁰ But where the attack is a cyberwar,¹⁰¹ and the victim State intends\nto respond with the use of force, Finlay and Payne, suggest the use of “a strict test of attribution.”¹⁰² Importantly, international law does not – and cannot – require absolute certainty in attribution.¹⁰³ But it requires reasonability.¹⁰⁴ For this reason, convincing circumstantial proof standard, is said to be sufficient.¹⁰⁵ Most of the attribution made by the CTIC agencies and private sector, appears to adopt this standard, using the Lin’s model and the ODNI’s indicators.¹⁰⁶\nThere are many areas for improvement that appear from the U.S. cyberattack attribution policies and process described above. First, there is a lack of a single attributing agency. The danger with this is the potential disagreement in evidence gathering and attributing standards amongst the different CTIC agencies.¹⁰⁷ One Bill – the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018 (CDRA) – currently pending before the Congress, which aims to “address state-sponsored cyber activities against the United States, and for other purpose,”¹⁰⁸ rather than address the problem, compounds it by adding the President to the list of those who can attribute. By section 3(1), the President, acting through the Secretary of State, and in coordination with other relevant Federal agency heads, shall make attribution. The Bill does not designate a single Federal agency for attribution.\nSecond, there is no known procedure for making attribution. The CDRA also falls short of laying down any procedure. The danger here is that the absence of a known procedure affects the transparency, the due process of identifying the attacker and “could hamper the credibility of attribution more broadly.”¹⁰⁹ Such absence is also susceptible to the use of unjustifiable countermeasure and self-defense under international law. Under international law, while Article 51 of the UN Charter codifies the customary international law right of a State to use self-defense if faced with an armed attack,¹¹⁰ such State must do so within clearly established principles, otherwise, it will become the aggressor.¹¹¹\nThird, the lack of a standardized procedure coupled with the participation of the private sector in attribution freely, is a cause for concern. Private entities like CrowdStrike, FireEye, Mandiant, SecureWork and Microsoft, have all released reports attributing cyberattacks to different threat actors, including States/State-sponsored entities. The potential dangers here are: First, there could be potential contradiction – where the CTIC could reach a different conclusion as to the source of an attack, while the private sector entities reach another.¹¹² Second, there could be an interference with an on-\n⁹¹ Eichensehr, supra note 52, at 3.\n⁹² See for instance, Annegret Bendiek &amp; Matthias Schulze, Attribution: A Major Challenge for EU Cyber Sanctions: An Analysis of WannaCry, NotPetya, Cloud Hopper, Bundestag Hack and the Attack on the OPCW, SWP Research Paper 11 (2021).\n⁹³ For discussion, see Tsagourias &amp; Farrell, supra note 82, at 965 (stating that “current attribution claims do not rely on any particular standard of proof and that international law is quite ambiguous in this regard.”).

But there can be no effective deterrence without adequate attribution.¹¹⁶ Hence, the issues associated with attribution – difficulty, time and lack of a process – have invariably prevented achieving an effective retaliation.¹¹⁷\n## 4. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation law and policy\nA State that has faced a cyberattack has varying options – both under its domestic legal system and international law – in retaliating the attack. For instance, under international law, there are typically four options available to the victim State: Self-defense, countermeasures, the plea of necessity, and retorsion.¹¹⁸ But the threshold required before using any of these options is fuzzy.¹¹⁹ It is, however, clear that the self-defense option is only available when a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or “use of force.”¹²⁰\nThere are a lot of scholarships on the applicability of international law principles on use of force to a situation where a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or use of force.¹²¹ But as conceptualized in this paper, a cyberattack does not escalate to the level of an armed attack.¹²² “To date,” state Finlay and Payne, “few if any of the known cyberattacks appear to meet the threshold for a ‘use of force,’ let alone for an ‘armed attack.’”¹²³ In this situation – that is, where it is\na cyberattack and not a cyberwar – international law scholars are divided on the implications of this under international law.¹²⁴ Notwithstanding, the impacts of cyberattacks – even if it falls short of an armed attack or use of force – can be significant.¹²⁵ Therefore, cyberattack by its nature, violates the principles of non-intervention¹²⁶ and sovereignty under international law.¹²⁷ Hathaway, et al. provide a list of four other legal regimes that could regulate retaliation for cyberattacks, even if cyberattacks do not constitute an armed attack or use of force (cyberwar).¹²⁸ This paper critiques the fourth legal regime – the U.S. domestic law and policy.\nThe U.S. cyber retaliation policies are not contained in a single policy document. There are several documents stipulating the goal of cyber retaliation, but none contains specific retaliation steps nor a set of retaliatory actions. The U.S. has consistently maintained that its aim in retaliating is to pass a message to cyber attackers “that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.”¹²⁹ The U.S. cyber retaliation policies can be aggregated from its National Security Strategy, DoD Zero Trust Strategy, White House Statements, and the International Cyber Strategy. Some of the retaliation policies also appear in the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report. These are considered serially. First, the 2022 National Security Strategy states the aim of retaliation for cyberattack thus:\n“We aim to deter cyberattacks from state and non-state actors and will respond decisively with all appropriate tools of national power to hostile acts in cyberspace, including those that disrupt or degrade vital national functions or critical infrastructure.

According to the Strategy, Integrated Deterrence entails five integrations. First, integration across domains, which recognizes that cyber threat actors operate across \"military (land, air, maritime, cyber, and space) and non-military (economic, technological, and information) domains—and that we must too.\"132 Second, integration across regions, which entails an understanding that cyber threat actors \"combine expansive ambitions with growing capabilities to threaten U.S. interests in key regions and in the homeland.\"133 Third, integration across the spectrum of conflict which aims \"to prevent cyber threat actors from altering the status quo in ways that harm U.S. vital interests while hovering below the threshold of armed conflict.\"134 The Strategy also entails integration across the U.S. Government; and integration with allies and partners.135 The Strategy states that Integrated Deterrence \"requires us to more effectively coordinate, network, and innovate so that any competitor thinking about pressing for advantage in one domain understands that we can respond in many others as well. This augments the traditional backstop of combat-credible conventional and strategic capabilities.\"136 The Strategy, however, does not contain specific retaliation steps nor set of retaliatory actions.\nSecond, some statements from the White House contain some of the retaliation policies. The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cybersecurity, for instance, aims to \"lock our digital doors\" and \"take aggressive action to strengthen and safeguard our nation's cybersecurity, including imposing costs on and strengthening our security against malicious actors.\"137 The Statement mentions the sanctioning of Russian cyber actors affiliated with the Russian intelligence services in response to the SolarWinds attack. It also mentions the imposition of cost against Iran for its counter-normative attack on Albanian government systems.138 Thus, the Statement mentions two retaliation options the U.S. resorts to as response to a cyberattack: Sanction and cost. But the Statement is not comprehensive, nor does it define when either of the retaliation options would be resorted to.\nThird, under the International Cyber Strategy, 2011, there are four steps preparatory to retaliation. They are (1) the U.S. will participate fully in international cybercrime policy development; (2) Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to the Budapest Convention; (3) Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the internet; and (4) Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the internet for operational planning, financing, or attacks.139 The Strategy develops three\nmodels: development, diplomacy and defense  $(\\mathrm{D}_3)$ . Where an attack occurs from a non-State threat actors, the retaliation includes investigation, apprehension, and prosecution.140 The Strategy further provides that when warranted, the U.S. will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace like any other threat. But before doing so, the U.S. would exhaust all other options, like weighing the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction. Where the U.S. resorts to the use of military force, it would categorize this as self-defense, and could compel actions under its military treaties with other countries.141 Where it gets to this, the U.S. could \"use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\"142 While the Strategy mentions the retaliatory actions, they are not clearly defined.\nFourth, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report, 2020 (CSC Report), also contains some of the U.S. retaliation policies and recommends some. The CSC Report establishes the \"layered cyber deterrence.\"143 Under this structure, the U.S. must shape the behavior in cyberspace; the U.S. must deny benefits to the cyber threat actors; and the U.S. must impose costs as retaliation for cyberattacks.144 The CSC Report also makes some recommendations with respect to retaliation. It recommends that the U.S. \"announce a second declaratory policy which would clearly state that the U.S. would respond using cyber and non-cyber capabilities to counter and impose costs\" against cyber threat actors \"below a use-of-force threshold.\"145 It also recommends that the U.S. government should \"publicly declare that it will defend forward, and couple its declaration with decisive and consistent action.\"146 According to the CSC Report, defend forward \"posits that to disrupt and defeat ongoing adversary campaigns, the United States must proactively observe, pursue, and counter adversaries' operations and impose costs short of armed conflict.\"147 The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cyber appears to be one of such public declaration. But as stated above, the Statement is not comprehensive.\nMuch of the criticisms on the U.S. cyber retaliation policies relate to its lack of preciseness. Preciseness is important for two reasons: First, it informs cyber threat actors of the actions that would be taken in retaliation for a cyberattack; and secondly, it encourages public debates among citizens to critique the retaliation actions sought to be taken against cyber threat actors.148 Another criticism is that the current retaliation options used by the U.S. are not sufficient, as they have not deterred cyberattacks.149 For this, some cyber experts have\n132 Id.\n133 Id.\n134 Id.\n135 Id.\n136 Id.\n137 THE WHITE HOUSE, Fact Sheet: Biden- Harris Administration Delivers on Strengthening America's Cybersecurity, October 11, 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-delivers-on-strengthening-americas-cybersecurity/.\n138 Id.\n139 International Strategy for Cyberspace, supra note 129, at 19-20.\n140 Id at 13.\n141 Id at 14.\n142 Id.\n143 Cyberspace Solarium Commission, Final Report, March 2020, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view\n144 Id. at 1.\n145 Id. at 34.\n146 Id.\n147 Id.\n148 Jakaran, supra note 117, at 10.\n149 Nathaniel Fick et al.

Yannakogeorgos, building on Healey's taxonomy, developed the below retaliation framework for State/State-sponsored attack:[150]\n|  Range of state activity | Development | Diplomacy | Defense  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  State prohibited | X |  |   |\n|  State prohibited but inadequate | X |  |   |\n|  State ignored | X | X |   |\n|  State encouraged |  | X |   |\n|  State shaped |  | X |   |\n|  State coordinated |  | X |   |\n|  State ordered |  |  | X  |\n|  State-rogue conducted |  |  | X  |\n|  State executed |  |  | X  |\n|  State integrated |  |  | X  |\nSource: Yannakogeorgos (2016) 'Strategy for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,' p. 55.\nThe above retaliation framework while useful, are not adhered to by the U.S. government in retaliation. Although, there are times when part of this framework has been adopted, one of the other criticisms of the U.S. cyber retaliation laws and policies is that the U.S. government is inconsistent in its application. Despite the several documents stipulating the U.S. cyber retaliation options, none contains specific retaliation steps. And despite these several documents, the U.S. continues to experience an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks. Law and policy recommendations addressing this will, thus, improve the retaliation policies.\n# 5. Law and policy recommendations\nIn this part, some law and policy recommendations on the gaps and criticisms identified above will be made.\n1. Law and Policy Recommendation for Characterization:\nA. Conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks to understand the current motivations for each TTPs. The actors for this should be the USCYBERCOM, FBI, CISA and DHS + private sector. This would encourage information sharing amongst the CTIC and the private sector. It would also lead to a faster and easier characterization process. With it, the CTIC would be able to quickly characterize a malfunction in the computer system or critical infrastructure as a cyberattack with the detection of the TTPs.\nB. Constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks. The actors for this should be the GAO, CISA and DHS. These actors should also work with the private sector in this regard. For instance, CrowdStrike's Threat Activity Table in its 2022 Report, includes \"generating currency to support a regime\" as\npart of the motivations for a State attack. $^{151}$  This recommendation is important because it would reflect the dynamics and changing nature of the motivations for cyberattacks. It would also assist with the appropriate cyber response and defense.\nC. Develop a joint characterization guideline (JCG) for cyberattacks. The recommended actors for this are CISA, DoJ, FBI and DHS. In the guideline, a rigid characterization description should be avoided. The JCG should be revised annually (or as appropriate, for instance, where a cyberattack necessitates the need to change something substantial). The JCG should avoid definitive characterization of an attack before a full-scale investigation. This recommendation is necessary to have a standardized approach for characterization. It would make the characterization process tidier.\n2. Law and Policy Recommendation for Attribution:\nA. Amend the CDRA before enactment. The actor for this is the Congress. The scope of the CDRA should be extended to cover other threat actors. The extant CDRA Bill deals with \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" However, majority of the cyberattacks against the U.S. are conducted by non-State threat actors.[152] The CDRA should create a body - The National Cyber Investigative Agency (NCIA) - and clothes it with the power to attribute to other cyber threat actors (other than State/State-sponsored actors) without the need for the President to make such attribution. The rationale for this law and policy is that the extant CDRA Bill covers only \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" It excludes cyberattacks by other cyber threat actors, who are equally a major threat. This recommendation would expand the scope of the CDRA to cover these other cyber threat actors. Also, under the CDRA, the President is empowered to make attribution for the \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" This recommendation recognizes that given the number of cyberattacks against the U.S. annually, the functionality of attributing all cyberattacks (when the scope of the CDRA is expanded) by the President is not feasible. This recommendation posits that the NCIA should instead, be tasked with attribution of other cyber threat actors.\nB. Designate the attribution function to a single agency - The NCIA. This recommendation may be done by the Congress through legislation (the CDRA could create the NCIA) or President through Executive Orders. One agency that may be reconstituted to the NCIA as an independent agency is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force.[153] All the CTIC agencies should\ncontinue providing supports in the attribution process as required by the NCIA. Only the NCIA should have the power to ultimately publicly attribute, though other CTIC agencies might publicize the attribution with the permission of NCIA. Also, the USTD should act on the attribution made by NCIA in blocking assets. In addition, the NCIA should be the advisory agency to the President in attributing cyberattacks to a State. The rationale for this recommendation is that in recent years, private sectors companies participate in the attributing of cyberattacks. As noted above in the Sony data beach and Olympic Destroyer attack, a lack of a coordinated attribution process may lead to contradictory attributions. This recommendation is aimed at addressing this. Also, this recommendation is apt to save cost and time in the attribution process. When a single agency (like the NCIA) is tasked with attribution, the cost and time expended by other CTIC agencies in attribution when aggregated will be reduced.\n2. Develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline (CAG). The NCIA should do this after its establishment. The CAG should stipulate the procedure for attribution. This would increase the transparency and credibility of the attribution process (due process). The CAG should also stipulate the requirements for private sector companies to make public attribution to States. It should require private sector companies to check with the NCIA before making public attributions to States/State-sponsored cyberattacks. The CAG may permit private sector companies to publicly make attribution with respect to other threat actors without consulting the NCIA. The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) should be under the NCIA. The rationale for this recommendation is that the JCDC was recently convened by the CISA to facilitate the relationship between the CTIC agencies and private sector companies in the attribution process.154 An effective collaboration between the public/private sectors requires a flexible terrain for the private sector.155 This recommendation posits that the CAG should be a document which clearly defines the assistance available to the private sector companies from the NCIA and other CTIC agencies in the attribution process.\n3. Law and Policy Recommendation on Retaliation\n1. Develop a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks. This may be done by the Congress through legislation; the President through Executive Orders or the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). The C_{3}RT would inform potential cyber threat actors the consequences of carrying out cyberattacks against the U.S. To be effective, the U.S. should strictly abide by it in retaliating. The C_{3}RT should contain very strict punishments for cyber threat actors. It should factor the range of State activity in the Yannako-georgos and Healey's retaliation framework in setting the severity of the retaliation. The EU has adopted this method through its “Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox.”156\n2. Develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES). The ONCD should be the lead actor for this. The ONCD should work on updating the National Cyber Strategy, 2018 as per its enabling statute -- the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.157 The National Cyber Strategy should contain the enforcement strategy. The C_{2}ES should include steps to strengthen the existing relationship with the EU and other U.S. allies. The C_{2}ES may build on the D_{3} of the International Cyber Strategy, 2011.\n3. Introduce new retaliatory actions in the C_{3}RT beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment. This could include hack-back in case the cyberattack is by a State/State-sponsored.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper considers three of the most important questions in responding to cyberattacks. These are characterization, attribution, and retaliation. It found that the U.S. characterization process is not clear, nor is there an international framework for characterization. The paper however, found that the GOA Threat Table, 2021, characterizes the motivations by cyber threat actors in carrying out cyberattacks. This table is not so much different from the GAO's Threat Table, 2005. Yet, recent studies reveal that cyber threat actors constantly change their TTP and could conceal their true motivation, in order to prevent the U.S. from appropriately responding to a cyberattack. To address this problem, the paper thus, recommends three things: (1) the CTIC should conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks; (2) the CTIC should constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks; and (3) a JCG for cyberattacks should be developed. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a clear attribution procedure. There is also no single agency with the power to attribute, with virtually all the CTIC agencies having the power to attribute. Also, private sector companies participate freely in attribution. The paper discusses the dangers with these and makes three recommendations: (1) the CDRA should be amended before enactment to extend its scope to cover other cyber threat actors; (2) the attribution function should be designated a single agency -- the NCIA; and (3) the NCIA should develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline which will set forth the requirements\nand regulations for private sector companies that attribute cyberattacks. Unlike both characterization and attribution, there are several documents containing the U.S. retaliation policies. But these documents do not contain specific steps in retaliating. The policies lack preciseness. The paper thus, recommends (1) the development of a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks; (2) the ONCD should develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES) and (3) the C_{3}RT should introduce other retaliatory actions beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment.\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.",

Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response.\n© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n# 1. Introduction\nThe definition of the term \"cyberattack,\" though, contained in different scholarly works, $^{1}$  is often equated to a lesser form, called \"cybercrime,\" and a more intense form, called \"cyber\nwar.\" The most prominent definition of cyberattack describes it as an attack initiated from a computer against a website, computer system or critical infrastructure, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the attacked computer or information stored on it. The Department of Defense (DoD) adopted the following comprehensive\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105847\n0267-3649/© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The intended effects of cyberattacks are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyberattack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyberattack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.\nWhen carried out, it aims to disrupt, disable, destroy, interfere, steal or control the data, information and functionality of the attacked computer or critical infrastructure. Generally, these attacks may be carried out by individuals, acting alone, or with others; terrorist organizations; non-state actors working for a State; or by State agencies – a prominent example of which was Russia's interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election using series of cyberattacks coordinated by State agencies.\nCyberattacks have taken different spectrums over the years, and the U.S. defense agencies have identified them. These include Network Denial, Enterprise Denial, Enterprise Manipulation, Mission Denial, and Mission Manipulation. The methods of carrying out cyberattacks are numerous. A consideration of these methods is outside the scope of this paper. But they deserve mention:\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Phishing attacks\n- Drive-by-download attack\n- Password Attack\n- SQL Injection Attack\n- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\n- Eavesdropping attack\nThis paper focuses on cyberattack, as distinguished from cybercrime and cyberwar. One of the best efforts showing the distinction amongst the concepts of cyberattack, cybercrime and cyberwar is that of Hathaway et al. in the paper, The Law of Cyber-Attack. To the authors, a cyberattack is “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.” To this end, any attack that is “not carried out for a political or national security purpose, such as most instances of internet fraud, identity theft, and intellectual property piracy, does not fit this final element of a “cyberattack” and is therefore mere cyber-crime.”\nAlso, cyberattacks are distinguishable from cyberwar. To Hathaway et al., ‘cyber-warfare’ is... a term properly used only to refer to the small subset of cyber-attacks that do constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict. From this distinction, a cyberattack may not constitute an armed attack under international law and thus, the retaliation to it is expected to fall short of an armed response. Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, attacks on any of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by the Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which though, do not have an effects equivalent to an “armed attack,” are classified as cyberattacks. This is because attacks on critical infrastructures pose a national security challenge as it may be injurious to both the people and the environment – for instance, the hacking of a critical infrastructure which releases toxic substance. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the U.S. experienced an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks in 2021, with the critical infrastructures a major target.\n DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, Memorandum for Chiefs of the Military Services, Commanders of the Combatant Commands and Directors of the Joint Staff Directorates (2011) https://info.publicintelligence.net/DoD-JointCyberTerms.pdf.\n Michael Power, Michael Pease, Keith Stouffer, CheeYee Tang, Timothy Zimmerman, Joseph Brule, et al.

Cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation, are related in some way. For instance, some scholars have classified characterization as part of the attribution process and to them, characterization is the attribution of cyberattacks to classes of adversaries.[18] These three processes are necessary in responding to cyberattacks and developing a robust cyber defense system.[19]\nThis paper is divided into six sections. After this introduction, Section 2 will focus on the U.S. characterization policies. Section 3 deals with attribution policies of cyberattacks against the U.S. Section 4 discusses the retaliation policies for cyberattacks against the U.S. The paper seeks to synthesize and answer the unanswered law and policy questions on characterization, attribution, and retaliation. To this end, the paper will critique the existing U.S. laws and policies on cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation. Section 5 will recommend laws and policies to address the identified gaps. Section 6 – the conclusion – will summarize the paper.\n# 2. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack characterization law and policy\nThe characterization process for cyberattacks by the U.S. intelligence and military agencies is not clear. There is equally no international standard for characterization.[20] In simple terms, characterization means the interpretation given to the abnormality that occurs to the proper functioning of a computer system.[21] Generally, the proper functioning of a computer system may be disrupted for different reasons, such as, human error, natural events or it may be deliberate (an attack). Where it is an attack, characterization is usually determined by the extent of the consequences of the attack.[22] Characterization is important in the response process for two main reasons. First, it shapes how to respond to the cyberattack. For instance, where it is determined that the attack is malicious, characterization will help in the deployment of appropriate response. Secondly, characterization is important to strengthen the cyber defense.[23]\nAn attack may be characterized in different ways: It may be for financial gains; for espionage; for service disruption; shaming; information gathering, among other. To characterize, the U.S. cyber threat intelligence community (CTIC)[24] and private sector companies, as a preliminary step, usually identify the potential source of the attack in order to monitor and determine how to respond to such attack. This has proved difficult, as the U.S. has continued to research the blueprints of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors, (that is, highly motivated, sophisticated, and organized threat groups).[25] For instance, between March and October 2021, the CTIC monitored Iranian government-sponsored APT actors. In March 2021, the FBI and CISA first observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors leverage Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet vulnerabilities to target a broad range of victims across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in furtherance of malicious activities. The monitoring continued till October 2021 before CISA finally publicly announced it in November 2021.[26]\nAlso, the FANCY BEAR adversary associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special Services (Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate), was first identified as initially using extensively spear-phishing emails containing \"malicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure when conducting cyberattacks\"27 but thereafter reevaluated \"its operational tradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use of credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and victim-tailored phishing websites.\"28\nOver the years, the U.S. intelligence community and other cyber defenders have utilized different tools to identify the potential source of an attack in order to characterize it. These tools are used to understand the activities of the cyber threat actors which are useful for characterization purposes. These tools include intrusion detection systems (IDS), anomaly behavior detection tools, firewalls, IP addresses and forensic analysis of malware.[29] The Government Accountability Office (GAO), CISA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a threat table characterizing each form of attacks by different threat actors (the Threat Table).[30] The Threat Table, contained in the GAO's March 2021 High-Risk Series, characterizes the motivations by criminal groups, hackers and hacktivists, insiders, nations and terrorist in the following manner:\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\n|  Threat actor | Description  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Criminal Group | Criminal groups seek to attack systems for monetary gain. Specifically, criminal groups use cyber exploits to commit identity theft, online fraud, and computer extortion. According to the 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment, criminal groups increasingly target U.S. critical infrastructure to generate profit, whether through ransomware, email impersonation fraud, social engineering, or malware.  |\n|  Hackers and hacktivists | Hackers break into networks for the challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain, among other reasons. By contrast, hacktivists are ideologically motivated actors who use cyber exploits to further political goals.  |\n|  Nation | Nations, including groups or programs sponsored or sanctioned by nation-states, use cyber tools as part of their information gathering and espionage activities.  |\n|  Terrorist | Terrorists seek to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit critical infrastructures in order to threaten national security, cause mass casualties, weaken the economy, and damage public morale and confidence.  |\n|  Source: GAO-21-288.31  |   |\nWhile generally, the Threat Table is an important tool in characterization, recent activities of cyber threat actors show that these actors do not necessarily conduct cyberattacks in accordance with the descriptions in the Threat Table. Thus, a strict adherence to the Threat Table may be outdated. For instance, according to the GAO and DHS's estimation in the Threat Table, terrorist groups \"do not currently have the sophisticated tools or skill necessary to execute a cyberattack that could cause a widespread outage or significantly damage the power system.\"32 If an attack significantly causes damage to the system, from this characterization, terrorists may be removed from the equation. But this potentially poses two dangers. First, it can limit the cyber response necessary for an attack. Secondly, it may lead to an embarrassing situation, \"if and when it is proven to have originated from more benign—if not necessarily less ominous (in terms of consequences)—causes.\"33 The Microsoft's Digital Defence Report, 2021, for instance, reveals the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) deployed by States like Russia and China,34 which make it dangerous to abide strictly by the Threat Table in the characterization process. Microsoft reported that in many instances, attackers did not conceal their actions, but concealed their intentions.35 It was found that hackers, who according to the Threat Table, are characterized as driven by \"challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain\" were in fact, carrying out\ninformation gathering characterized as States' motivation under the Threat Table.[36]\nVery little has changed from the GAO's Threat Table since 2005.[37] Yet, cyber threat actors have continued to expand their operations in old and new ways.[38] Like criminal groups, Nation State actors, have \"moved toward targeting poorly configured or unpatched enterprise systems (VPN/VPS infrastructure, on-premises servers, third-party software) to perform living-off-the-land attacks.\"[39]\n# 3. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack attribution law and policy\nAttributing an attack to a particular source is one of the major challenges in cyberattack response.40 But to the ODNI, though difficult, it is not impossible.41 Just like characterization, there is also no clear international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks.42 Yet, international law, while it allows the use of force for self-defense,43 demands that such force must be directed against the attacker.44 Thus, to lawfully use a countermeasure in response to a cyberattack, the victim State must first attribute the attack to the perpetrator precisely.45\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\nBut, attribution is said to have received \"comparatively little attention\" under international law.46 Scholars have expressed concern about the lack of an international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks which it is believed, gives States the abilities to [wrongfully] name and shame another country as the cyber attacker without a guiding principle on evidence gathering, sources, manner and extent.47 For instance, it is believed that the U.S. holds the view that the attribution process does not need to follow any strict legal standard and that its obligation under international law does not require it to disclose details (such as sources, manner of gathering etc.) about the evidence used to support its attribution of cyberattacks to cyber threat actors.48\nAttribution involves the means by which the available evidence related to a cyberattack is organized, examined, and connected to a source.49 It is the identification of the cyber attacker.50 It generally involves a three-level analysis – the tactical (technical), the operational, and the strategic.51 But day by day, cyber attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their TTPs, making it more difficult to trace evidence to a particular source in order to attribute.52 For instance, in the SolarWinds cyber incidents, cyber attackers deployed malicious code to SolarWinds' Orion IT monitoring and management software used by government agencies across the world, including the U.S. government. The attackers used the U.S. domestic infrastructure, which made it more difficult to trace the source of the attack.53 Thus, it has been suggested that in the attribu\ntion process, \"who is to blame?\" can be more important than \"who did it?\".54\nNotwithstanding the preceding, the ODNI believes that all cyber operation leaves a trail.[55] Both the CTIC and private sector companies have developed tools to assist in making a precise attribution. Some of these include tradecraft, network traffic, computer log entries, malware collection, file timestamps, utilizing publicly available websites, blogs, and document repositories, among others.[56] Though, the availability of these artifacts does not, itself, guarantee a conclusive proof of the source of an attack.[57]\nThe cyber attributing body in the U.S. has transcended beyond the CTIC alone.[58] Now, private companies, notably, CrowdStrike,[59] FireEye,[60] Mandiant,[61] Microsoft,[62] among others, partake in attribution. For instance, in its 2022 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike reportd and attributed the activities of COZY BEAR to Russia. It noted that during its investigation, COZY BEAR operators used \"authentication cookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks.\"[63] Also, in its Digital Defense Report 2022, Microsoft made cyber attribution to States. Microsoft reported that it detected Russian network intrusion efforts against 128 organizations in 42 countries between February and June 2022 and that the U.S. was Russia's number one target.[64]\nAs for the CTIC, the DHS notes that there is generally no single agency that has \"the authorities, capabilities, and expertise to deal unilaterally with a significant cyber incident.\"[65] All the CTIC agencies work to complement the activities of each other. However, by the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive-United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD-41),[66] the DoJ, acting through the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), is the Federal lead agency for cyber threat response activities.[67] Attribution is listed as one of the cy\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\nber threat response activities in PPD-41. Thus, from this provision, the DoJ, FBI and NCIJTF need to work together to make an attribution. Nonetheless, from a complete reading of the PPD-41, the ODNI, DHS, and other CTIC agencies could contribute to the attribution analysis.\nInterestingly, under U.S. law, the Secretary to the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD) could also make attribution. By Executive Orders 13694 and 13757 (E.Os. 13694 and 13757), the property of any person attributed by the Secretary to the USTD, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to have conducted a cyberattack which constitutes a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the U.S., are blocked from transfer, exported, or withdrawn. The USTD, through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for instance, exercised its power under E.Os. 13694 and 13757 by blocking Park Jin Hyok's assets in 2018 after being linked to WannaCry. But as noted below, the lack of a single attributing agency calls for a change.\nThere are different attribution models which have been developed to aid the attribution process. A popular one is the Herbert Lin's model. The model adopts three levels in the attribution process, namely, machines, human operators, and the ultimate responsible party. The first level requires forensic investigation of machines. Here, logfiles and IP address may be examined to locate the source of the attack. The second level requires identifying the specific individual responsible for the attack. Here, to Lin, forensics alone is not sufficient. Investigators need to accumulate a set of clues – such as historical records, private online forum, authentication – to pin the attack on a specific individual. The last level requires identifying the entity an attacker works for: It could be for a terrorist group, government or alone. Here, one way to make this determination would be to interview the attacker. There is proof of usage of this model by private cybersecurity firms. On its part, in using the Lin's model, there are different ways the CTIC agencies could achieve this. First, the CTIC agencies could leverage on the efforts of the private sector companies. Second, the CTIC agencies could utilize some surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which allows surveillance for national security or foreign intelligence investigations against a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\nAccording to the ODNI, the CTIC's attribution process is modeled after some key indicators: Tradecraft, infrastructure, malware, and intent, with tradecraft the most important indicator in the attribution process because \"habits are more difficult to change than technical tools.\" While the ODNI's Guide to Cyber Attribution does not contain a layer of steps in the attribution process, the Guide contains all the Lin's tools. Apart from the Lin's Model, in complying with its international law obligation regarding attribution, the U.S. can also use both data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations and documentary evidence.\nCyber attribution is important, because without it, there would not be deterrence for cyber attackers. The U.S. attribution policies are modeled to achieve three goals, namely, public attribution; indictment; and sanction. Public attribution involves publicly naming a threat actor as the attacker. The principal aim of this approach is to publicly name and shame an attacker, especially States, with the view that the embarrassment from the naming and shaming, would deter the attacker from conducting another cyberattack. CTIC, especially CISA through its alert system, and private companies, have adopted this method. Sanctions and indictments have also been used by the U.S. government in concert with public attribution.\nIt is, however, generally agreed within the cyber community that the trio of public attribution, sanctions, and indictments, are not sufficient in achieving the attribution goal. This is true, considering that from the various recent reports by the CTIC and private sector companies, cyber threat actors continue to conduct cyberattacks against the U.S., despite public attributions, sanctions, and indictments against cyber attackers. Further, another gap in the U.S. laws and policies for attribution is the lack of a definitive standard of proof required to make attribution. Generally, it is extremely difficult in the attribution process to be almost certain about the source of a\n Id.\n Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Orders 13694 of April 1, 2015, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities.\n Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/cyber2_eo.pdf.\n DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Press Release: Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks, U.S. (Sept. 6, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm473.\n Lin, supra note 57.\n Id. at 81.\n Id. at 84.\n Id.\n Id. at 86-7\n Milton Mueller, Karl Grindal, Brenden Kuerbis &amp; Farzaneh Badiei, Cyber Attribution: Can a New Institution Achieve Transnational Credibility? 4(1) THE CYBER DEFENSE REV. 107, 108 (2019).\n Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 49.\n Lin, supra note 57, at 17.\n A Guide to Cyber Attribution, supra note 41, at 3.\n Id.\n Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Muchael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31(3) EUR.

Yet, in order to effectively respond to a cyberattack – particularly under international law – attribution must first be made by the States.\nThis attribution challenge is not exclusively a U.S. problem. This is a problem faced in all jurisdictions. More problematic is that international law does not provide a definite guide. International law has been accused of failing to “set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution.” Varying degrees of standards of proof have been laid by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for determining State responsibility under international law. The ICJ at various times has required exceptional gravity, fully conclusive and clear and convincing standard of proofs. Scholars believe that it is because of a lack of a single standard by the ICJ that the “Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be determined by the relevant forum.”\nAlthough scholars have clamored for a solution to the foregoing problem, “yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism.” Notwithstanding, eminent international law scholars have attempted to provide an international law standard for attribution of cyberattack. For instance, where the cyberattack is less serious, Tsagourias and Farrell argue that “preponderance of the evidence” is the most appropriate standard. They reasoned that both a very high standard, such as “beyond a reasonable doubt” and a low standard, may not ensure a balance. But where the attack is a cyberwar, and the victim State intends\nto respond with the use of force, Finlay and Payne, suggest the use of “a strict test of attribution.” Importantly, international law does not – and cannot – require absolute certainty in attribution. But it requires reasonability. For this reason, convincing circumstantial proof standard, is said to be sufficient. Most of the attribution made by the CTIC agencies and private sector, appears to adopt this standard, using the Lin’s model and the ODNI’s indicators.\nThere are many areas for improvement that appear from the U.S. cyberattack attribution policies and process described above. First, there is a lack of a single attributing agency. The danger with this is the potential disagreement in evidence gathering and attributing standards amongst the different CTIC agencies. One Bill – the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018 (CDRA) – currently pending before the Congress, which aims to “address state-sponsored cyber activities against the United States, and for other purpose,” rather than address the problem, compounds it by adding the President to the list of those who can attribute. By section 3(1), the President, acting through the Secretary of State, and in coordination with other relevant Federal agency heads, shall make attribution. The Bill does not designate a single Federal agency for attribution.\nSecond, there is no known procedure for making attribution. The CDRA also falls short of laying down any procedure. The danger here is that the absence of a known procedure affects the transparency, the due process of identifying the attacker and “could hamper the credibility of attribution more broadly.” Such absence is also susceptible to the use of unjustifiable countermeasure and self-defense under international law. Under international law, while Article 51 of the UN Charter codifies the customary international law right of a State to use self-defense if faced with an armed attack, such State must do so within clearly established principles, otherwise, it will become the aggressor.\nThird, the lack of a standardized procedure coupled with the participation of the private sector in attribution freely, is a cause for concern. Private entities like CrowdStrike, FireEye, Mandiant, SecureWork and Microsoft, have all released reports attributing cyberattacks to different threat actors, including States/State-sponsored entities. The potential dangers here are: First, there could be potential contradiction – where the CTIC could reach a different conclusion as to the source of an attack, while the private sector entities reach another. Second, there could be an interference with an on-\n Eichensehr, supra note 52, at 3.\n See for instance, Annegret Bendiek &amp; Matthias Schulze, Attribution: A Major Challenge for EU Cyber Sanctions: An Analysis of WannaCry, NotPetya, Cloud Hopper, Bundestag Hack and the Attack on the OPCW, SWP Research Paper 11 (2021).\n For discussion, see Tsagourias &amp; Farrell, supra note 82, at 965 (stating that “current attribution claims do not rely on any particular standard of proof and that international law is quite ambiguous in this regard.”).

For instance, in 2014, when the Sony data beach occurred, some private sector companies disagreed with the CTIC attribution of the attack to North Korea, arguing that it was an insider attack. Also, there was contradiction amongst the private sector companies over the Olympic Destroyer attack, where some believed that North Korea was initially responsible, while others believed it was Russia. Attribution is necessary because most of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation policies are aimed toward achieving deterrence. But there can be no effective deterrence without adequate attribution. Hence, the issues associated with attribution – difficulty, time and lack of a process – have invariably prevented achieving an effective retaliation.\n## 4. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation law and policy\nA State that has faced a cyberattack has varying options – both under its domestic legal system and international law – in retaliating the attack. For instance, under international law, there are typically four options available to the victim State: Self-defense, countermeasures, the plea of necessity, and retorsion. But the threshold required before using any of these options is fuzzy. It is, however, clear that the self-defense option is only available when a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or “use of force.”\nThere are a lot of scholarships on the applicability of international law principles on use of force to a situation where a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or use of force. But as conceptualized in this paper, a cyberattack does not escalate to the level of an armed attack. “To date,” state Finlay and Payne, “few if any of the known cyberattacks appear to meet the threshold for a ‘use of force,’ let alone for an ‘armed attack.’” In this situation – that is, where it is\na cyberattack and not a cyberwar – international law scholars are divided on the implications of this under international law. Notwithstanding, the impacts of cyberattacks – even if it falls short of an armed attack or use of force – can be significant. Therefore, cyberattack by its nature, violates the principles of non-intervention and sovereignty under international law. Hathaway, et al. provide a list of four other legal regimes that could regulate retaliation for cyberattacks, even if cyberattacks do not constitute an armed attack or use of force (cyberwar). This paper critiques the fourth legal regime – the U.S. domestic law and policy.\nThe U.S. cyber retaliation policies are not contained in a single policy document. There are several documents stipulating the goal of cyber retaliation, but none contains specific retaliation steps nor a set of retaliatory actions. The U.S. has consistently maintained that its aim in retaliating is to pass a message to cyber attackers “that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.” The U.S. cyber retaliation policies can be aggregated from its National Security Strategy, DoD Zero Trust Strategy, White House Statements, and the International Cyber Strategy. Some of the retaliation policies also appear in the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report. These are considered serially. First, the 2022 National Security Strategy states the aim of retaliation for cyberattack thus:\n“We aim to deter cyberattacks from state and non-state actors and will respond decisively with all appropriate tools of national power to hostile acts in cyberspace, including those that disrupt or degrade vital national functions or critical infrastructure. We will continue to promote adherence to the UN General Assembly-endorsed framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, which recognizes that international law applies online, just as it does offline.”\nIn the 2022 National Security Strategy, the U.S. states that it will adopt “Integrated Deterrence” in achieving its retaliation objectives. Integrated Deterrence recognizes that\n Id. at 479-80.\n Id. at 479.\n Id.\n See Clara Assumpção, The Problem of Cyber Attribution Between States 1 (2020) https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/83271 (stating that “attributing responsibility to who perpetrated an attack against a state and, even more importantly, who ordered it, is a way to achieve cyber deterrence”).\n Chris Jakaran, Cybersecurity: Deterrence Policy, (2022) Congressional Research Service 47011.\n Schmitt, supra note 45, at 244.\n Id.\n Finlay &amp; Payne, supra note 93, at 202.\n See for instance, Michael N.

According to the Strategy, Integrated Deterrence entails five integrations. First, integration across domains, which recognizes that cyber threat actors operate across \"military (land, air, maritime, cyber, and space) and non-military (economic, technological, and information) domains—and that we must too.\"132 Second, integration across regions, which entails an understanding that cyber threat actors \"combine expansive ambitions with growing capabilities to threaten U.S. interests in key regions and in the homeland.\"133 Third, integration across the spectrum of conflict which aims \"to prevent cyber threat actors from altering the status quo in ways that harm U.S. vital interests while hovering below the threshold of armed conflict.\"134 The Strategy also entails integration across the U.S. Government; and integration with allies and partners.135 The Strategy states that Integrated Deterrence \"requires us to more effectively coordinate, network, and innovate so that any competitor thinking about pressing for advantage in one domain understands that we can respond in many others as well. This augments the traditional backstop of combat-credible conventional and strategic capabilities.\"136 The Strategy, however, does not contain specific retaliation steps nor set of retaliatory actions.\nSecond, some statements from the White House contain some of the retaliation policies. The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cybersecurity, for instance, aims to \"lock our digital doors\" and \"take aggressive action to strengthen and safeguard our nation's cybersecurity, including imposing costs on and strengthening our security against malicious actors.\"137 The Statement mentions the sanctioning of Russian cyber actors affiliated with the Russian intelligence services in response to the SolarWinds attack. It also mentions the imposition of cost against Iran for its counter-normative attack on Albanian government systems.138 Thus, the Statement mentions two retaliation options the U.S. resorts to as response to a cyberattack: Sanction and cost. But the Statement is not comprehensive, nor does it define when either of the retaliation options would be resorted to.\nThird, under the International Cyber Strategy, 2011, there are four steps preparatory to retaliation. They are (1) the U.S. will participate fully in international cybercrime policy development; (2) Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to the Budapest Convention; (3) Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the internet; and (4) Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the internet for operational planning, financing, or attacks.139 The Strategy develops three\nmodels: development, diplomacy and defense  $(\\mathrm{D}_3)$ . Where an attack occurs from a non-State threat actors, the retaliation includes investigation, apprehension, and prosecution.140 The Strategy further provides that when warranted, the U.S. will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace like any other threat. But before doing so, the U.S. would exhaust all other options, like weighing the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction. Where the U.S. resorts to the use of military force, it would categorize this as self-defense, and could compel actions under its military treaties with other countries.141 Where it gets to this, the U.S. could \"use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\"142 While the Strategy mentions the retaliatory actions, they are not clearly defined.\nFourth, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report, 2020 (CSC Report), also contains some of the U.S. retaliation policies and recommends some. The CSC Report establishes the \"layered cyber deterrence.\"143 Under this structure, the U.S. must shape the behavior in cyberspace; the U.S. must deny benefits to the cyber threat actors; and the U.S. must impose costs as retaliation for cyberattacks.144 The CSC Report also makes some recommendations with respect to retaliation. It recommends that the U.S. \"announce a second declaratory policy which would clearly state that the U.S. would respond using cyber and non-cyber capabilities to counter and impose costs\" against cyber threat actors \"below a use-of-force threshold.\"145 It also recommends that the U.S. government should \"publicly declare that it will defend forward, and couple its declaration with decisive and consistent action.\"146 According to the CSC Report, defend forward \"posits that to disrupt and defeat ongoing adversary campaigns, the United States must proactively observe, pursue, and counter adversaries' operations and impose costs short of armed conflict.\"147 The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cyber appears to be one of such public declaration. But as stated above, the Statement is not comprehensive.\nMuch of the criticisms on the U.S. cyber retaliation policies relate to its lack of preciseness. Preciseness is important for two reasons: First, it informs cyber threat actors of the actions that would be taken in retaliation for a cyberattack; and secondly, it encourages public debates among citizens to critique the retaliation actions sought to be taken against cyber threat actors.148 Another criticism is that the current retaliation options used by the U.S. are not sufficient, as they have not deterred cyberattacks.149 For this, some cyber experts have\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\ndeveloped a cyber retaliation framework from the existing retaliation laws and policies, especially from the  $\\mathrm{D}_3$ . Yannakogeorgos, building on Healey's taxonomy, developed the below retaliation framework for State/State-sponsored attack:[150]\n|  Range of state activity | Development | Diplomacy | Defense  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  State prohibited | X |  |   |\n|  State prohibited but inadequate | X |  |   |\n|  State ignored | X | X |   |\n|  State encouraged |  | X |   |\n|  State shaped |  | X |   |\n|  State coordinated |  | X |   |\n|  State ordered |  |  | X  |\n|  State-rogue conducted |  |  | X  |\n|  State executed |  |  | X  |\n|  State integrated |  |  | X  |\nSource: Yannakogeorgos (2016) 'Strategy for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,' p. 55.\nThe above retaliation framework while useful, are not adhered to by the U.S. government in retaliation. Although, there are times when part of this framework has been adopted, one of the other criticisms of the U.S. cyber retaliation laws and policies is that the U.S. government is inconsistent in its application. Despite the several documents stipulating the U.S. cyber retaliation options, none contains specific retaliation steps. And despite these several documents, the U.S. continues to experience an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks. Law and policy recommendations addressing this will, thus, improve the retaliation policies.\n# 5. Law and policy recommendations\nIn this part, some law and policy recommendations on the gaps and criticisms identified above will be made.\n1. Law and Policy Recommendation for Characterization:\nA. Conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks to understand the current motivations for each TTPs. The actors for this should be the USCYBERCOM, FBI, CISA and DHS + private sector. This would encourage information sharing amongst the CTIC and the private sector. It would also lead to a faster and easier characterization process. With it, the CTIC would be able to quickly characterize a malfunction in the computer system or critical infrastructure as a cyberattack with the detection of the TTPs.\nB. Constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks. The actors for this should be the GAO, CISA and DHS. These actors should also work with the private sector in this regard. For instance, CrowdStrike's Threat Activity Table in its 2022 Report, includes \"generating currency to support a regime\" as\npart of the motivations for a State attack. $^{151}$  This recommendation is important because it would reflect the dynamics and changing nature of the motivations for cyberattacks. It would also assist with the appropriate cyber response and defense.\nC. Develop a joint characterization guideline (JCG) for cyberattacks. The recommended actors for this are CISA, DoJ, FBI and DHS. In the guideline, a rigid characterization description should be avoided. The JCG should be revised annually (or as appropriate, for instance, where a cyberattack necessitates the need to change something substantial). The JCG should avoid definitive characterization of an attack before a full-scale investigation. This recommendation is necessary to have a standardized approach for characterization. It would make the characterization process tidier.\n2. Law and Policy Recommendation for Attribution:\nA. Amend the CDRA before enactment. The actor for this is the Congress. The scope of the CDRA should be extended to cover other threat actors. The extant CDRA Bill deals with \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" However, majority of the cyberattacks against the U.S. are conducted by non-State threat actors.[152] The CDRA should create a body - The National Cyber Investigative Agency (NCIA) - and clothes it with the power to attribute to other cyber threat actors (other than State/State-sponsored actors) without the need for the President to make such attribution. The rationale for this law and policy is that the extant CDRA Bill covers only \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" It excludes cyberattacks by other cyber threat actors, who are equally a major threat. This recommendation would expand the scope of the CDRA to cover these other cyber threat actors. Also, under the CDRA, the President is empowered to make attribution for the \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" This recommendation recognizes that given the number of cyberattacks against the U.S. annually, the functionality of attributing all cyberattacks (when the scope of the CDRA is expanded) by the President is not feasible. This recommendation posits that the NCIA should instead, be tasked with attribution of other cyber threat actors.\nB. Designate the attribution function to a single agency - The NCIA. This recommendation may be done by the Congress through legislation (the CDRA could create the NCIA) or President through Executive Orders. One agency that may be reconstituted to the NCIA as an independent agency is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force.[153] All the CTIC agencies should\ncontinue providing supports in the attribution process as required by the NCIA. Only the NCIA should have the power to ultimately publicly attribute, though other CTIC agencies might publicize the attribution with the permission of NCIA. Also, the USTD should act on the attribution made by NCIA in blocking assets. In addition, the NCIA should be the advisory agency to the President in attributing cyberattacks to a State. The rationale for this recommendation is that in recent years, private sectors companies participate in the attributing of cyberattacks. As noted above in the Sony data beach and Olympic Destroyer attack, a lack of a coordinated attribution process may lead to contradictory attributions. This recommendation is aimed at addressing this. Also, this recommendation is apt to save cost and time in the attribution process. When a single agency (like the NCIA) is tasked with attribution, the cost and time expended by other CTIC agencies in attribution when aggregated will be reduced.\n2. Develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline (CAG). The NCIA should do this after its establishment. The CAG should stipulate the procedure for attribution. This would increase the transparency and credibility of the attribution process (due process). The CAG should also stipulate the requirements for private sector companies to make public attribution to States. It should require private sector companies to check with the NCIA before making public attributions to States/State-sponsored cyberattacks. The CAG may permit private sector companies to publicly make attribution with respect to other threat actors without consulting the NCIA. The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) should be under the NCIA. The rationale for this recommendation is that the JCDC was recently convened by the CISA to facilitate the relationship between the CTIC agencies and private sector companies in the attribution process.154 An effective collaboration between the public/private sectors requires a flexible terrain for the private sector.155 This recommendation posits that the CAG should be a document which clearly defines the assistance available to the private sector companies from the NCIA and other CTIC agencies in the attribution process.\n3. Law and Policy Recommendation on Retaliation\n1. Develop a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks. This may be done by the Congress through legislation; the President through Executive Orders or the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). The C_{3}RT would inform potential cyber threat actors the consequences of carrying out cyberattacks against the U.S. To be effective, the U.S. should strictly abide by it in retaliating. The C_{3}RT should contain very strict punishments for cyber threat actors. It should factor the range of State activity in the Yannako-georgos and Healey's retaliation framework in setting the severity of the retaliation. The EU has adopted this method through its “Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox.”156\n2. Develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES). The ONCD should be the lead actor for this. The ONCD should work on updating the National Cyber Strategy, 2018 as per its enabling statute -- the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.157 The National Cyber Strategy should contain the enforcement strategy. The C_{2}ES should include steps to strengthen the existing relationship with the EU and other U.S. allies. The C_{2}ES may build on the D_{3} of the International Cyber Strategy, 2011.\n3. Introduce new retaliatory actions in the C_{3}RT beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment. This could include hack-back in case the cyberattack is by a State/State-sponsored.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper considers three of the most important questions in responding to cyberattacks. These are characterization, attribution, and retaliation. It found that the U.S. characterization process is not clear, nor is there an international framework for characterization. The paper however, found that the GOA Threat Table, 2021, characterizes the motivations by cyber threat actors in carrying out cyberattacks. This table is not so much different from the GAO's Threat Table, 2005. Yet, recent studies reveal that cyber threat actors constantly change their TTP and could conceal their true motivation, in order to prevent the U.S. from appropriately responding to a cyberattack. To address this problem, the paper thus, recommends three things: (1) the CTIC should conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks; (2) the CTIC should constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks; and (3) a JCG for cyberattacks should be developed. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a clear attribution procedure. There is also no single agency with the power to attribute, with virtually all the CTIC agencies having the power to attribute. Also, private sector companies participate freely in attribution. The paper discusses the dangers with these and makes three recommendations: (1) the CDRA should be amended before enactment to extend its scope to cover other cyber threat actors; (2) the attribution function should be designated a single agency -- the NCIA; and (3) the NCIA should develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline which will set forth the requirements\nand regulations for private sector companies that attribute cyberattacks. Unlike both characterization and attribution, there are several documents containing the U.S. retaliation policies. But these documents do not contain specific steps in retaliating. The policies lack preciseness. The paper thus, recommends (1) the development of a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks; (2) the ONCD should develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES) and (3) the C_{3}RT should introduce other retaliatory actions beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment.\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.",

Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response.\n© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n# 1. Introduction\nThe definition of the term \"cyberattack,\" though, contained in different scholarly works, $^{1}$  is often equated to a lesser form, called \"cybercrime,\" and a more intense form, called \"cyber\nwar.\" The most prominent definition of cyberattack describes it as an attack initiated from a computer against a website, computer system or critical infrastructure, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the attacked computer or information stored on it. The Department of Defense (DoD) adopted the following comprehensive\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105847\n0267-3649/© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The intended effects of cyberattacks are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyberattack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyberattack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.\nWhen carried out, it aims to disrupt, disable, destroy, interfere, steal or control the data, information and functionality of the attacked computer or critical infrastructure. Generally, these attacks may be carried out by individuals, acting alone, or with others; terrorist organizations; non-state actors working for a State; or by State agencies – a prominent example of which was Russia's interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election using series of cyberattacks coordinated by State agencies.\nCyberattacks have taken different spectrums over the years, and the U.S. defense agencies have identified them. These include Network Denial, Enterprise Denial, Enterprise Manipulation, Mission Denial, and Mission Manipulation. The methods of carrying out cyberattacks are numerous. A consideration of these methods is outside the scope of this paper. But they deserve mention:\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Phishing attacks\n- Drive-by-download attack\n- Password Attack\n- SQL Injection Attack\n- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\n- Eavesdropping attack\nThis paper focuses on cyberattack, as distinguished from cybercrime and cyberwar. One of the best efforts showing the distinction amongst the concepts of cyberattack, cybercrime and cyberwar is that of Hathaway et al. in the paper, The Law of Cyber-Attack. To the authors, a cyberattack is “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.” To this end, any attack that is “not carried out for a political or national security purpose, such as most instances of internet fraud, identity theft, and intellectual property piracy, does not fit this final element of a “cyberattack” and is therefore mere cyber-crime.”\nAlso, cyberattacks are distinguishable from cyberwar. To Hathaway et al., ‘cyber-warfare’ is... a term properly used only to refer to the small subset of cyber-attacks that do constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict. From this distinction, a cyberattack may not constitute an armed attack under international law and thus, the retaliation to it is expected to fall short of an armed response. Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, attacks on any of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by the Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which though, do not have an effects equivalent to an “armed attack,” are classified as cyberattacks. This is because attacks on critical infrastructures pose a national security challenge as it may be injurious to both the people and the environment – for instance, the hacking of a critical infrastructure which releases toxic substance. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the U.S. experienced an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks in 2021, with the critical infrastructures a major target.\n DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, Memorandum for Chiefs of the Military Services, Commanders of the Combatant Commands and Directors of the Joint Staff Directorates (2011) https://info.publicintelligence.net/DoD-JointCyberTerms.pdf.\n Michael Power, Michael Pease, Keith Stouffer, CheeYee Tang, Timothy Zimmerman, Joseph Brule, et al.

Cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation, are related in some way. For instance, some scholars have classified characterization as part of the attribution process and to them, characterization is the attribution of cyberattacks to classes of adversaries.[18] These three processes are necessary in responding to cyberattacks and developing a robust cyber defense system.[19]\nThis paper is divided into six sections. After this introduction, Section 2 will focus on the U.S. characterization policies. Section 3 deals with attribution policies of cyberattacks against the U.S. Section 4 discusses the retaliation policies for cyberattacks against the U.S. The paper seeks to synthesize and answer the unanswered law and policy questions on characterization, attribution, and retaliation. To this end, the paper will critique the existing U.S. laws and policies on cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation. Section 5 will recommend laws and policies to address the identified gaps. Section 6 – the conclusion – will summarize the paper.\n# 2. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack characterization law and policy\nThe characterization process for cyberattacks by the U.S. intelligence and military agencies is not clear. There is equally no international standard for characterization.[20] In simple terms, characterization means the interpretation given to the abnormality that occurs to the proper functioning of a computer system.[21] Generally, the proper functioning of a computer system may be disrupted for different reasons, such as, human error, natural events or it may be deliberate (an attack). Where it is an attack, characterization is usually determined by the extent of the consequences of the attack.[22] Characterization is important in the response process for two main reasons. First, it shapes how to respond to the cyberattack. For instance, where it is determined that the attack is malicious, characterization will help in the deployment of appropriate response. Secondly, characterization is important to strengthen the cyber defense.[23]\nAn attack may be characterized in different ways: It may be for financial gains; for espionage; for service disruption; shaming; information gathering, among other. To characterize, the U.S. cyber threat intelligence community (CTIC)[24] and private sector companies, as a preliminary step, usually identify the potential source of the attack in order to monitor and determine how to respond to such attack. This has proved difficult, as the U.S. has continued to research the blueprints of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors, (that is, highly motivated, sophisticated, and organized threat groups).[25] For instance, between March and October 2021, the CTIC monitored Iranian government-sponsored APT actors. In March 2021, the FBI and CISA first observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors leverage Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet vulnerabilities to target a broad range of victims across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in furtherance of malicious activities. The monitoring continued till October 2021 before CISA finally publicly announced it in November 2021.[26]\nAlso, the FANCY BEAR adversary associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special Services (Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate), was first identified as initially using extensively spear-phishing emails containing \"malicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure when conducting cyberattacks\"27 but thereafter reevaluated \"its operational tradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use of credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and victim-tailored phishing websites.\"28\nOver the years, the U.S. intelligence community and other cyber defenders have utilized different tools to identify the potential source of an attack in order to characterize it. These tools are used to understand the activities of the cyber threat actors which are useful for characterization purposes. These tools include intrusion detection systems (IDS), anomaly behavior detection tools, firewalls, IP addresses and forensic analysis of malware.[29] The Government Accountability Office (GAO), CISA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a threat table characterizing each form of attacks by different threat actors (the Threat Table).[30] The Threat Table, contained in the GAO's March 2021 High-Risk Series, characterizes the motivations by criminal groups, hackers and hacktivists, insiders, nations and terrorist in the following manner:\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\n|  Threat actor | Description  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Criminal Group | Criminal groups seek to attack systems for monetary gain. Specifically, criminal groups use cyber exploits to commit identity theft, online fraud, and computer extortion. According to the 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment, criminal groups increasingly target U.S. critical infrastructure to generate profit, whether through ransomware, email impersonation fraud, social engineering, or malware.  |\n|  Hackers and hacktivists | Hackers break into networks for the challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain, among other reasons. By contrast, hacktivists are ideologically motivated actors who use cyber exploits to further political goals.  |\n|  Nation | Nations, including groups or programs sponsored or sanctioned by nation-states, use cyber tools as part of their information gathering and espionage activities.  |\n|  Terrorist | Terrorists seek to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit critical infrastructures in order to threaten national security, cause mass casualties, weaken the economy, and damage public morale and confidence.  |\n|  Source: GAO-21-288.31  |   |\nWhile generally, the Threat Table is an important tool in characterization, recent activities of cyber threat actors show that these actors do not necessarily conduct cyberattacks in accordance with the descriptions in the Threat Table. Thus, a strict adherence to the Threat Table may be outdated. For instance, according to the GAO and DHS's estimation in the Threat Table, terrorist groups \"do not currently have the sophisticated tools or skill necessary to execute a cyberattack that could cause a widespread outage or significantly damage the power system.\"32 If an attack significantly causes damage to the system, from this characterization, terrorists may be removed from the equation. But this potentially poses two dangers. First, it can limit the cyber response necessary for an attack. Secondly, it may lead to an embarrassing situation, \"if and when it is proven to have originated from more benign—if not necessarily less ominous (in terms of consequences)—causes.\"33 The Microsoft's Digital Defence Report, 2021, for instance, reveals the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) deployed by States like Russia and China,34 which make it dangerous to abide strictly by the Threat Table in the characterization process. Microsoft reported that in many instances, attackers did not conceal their actions, but concealed their intentions.35 It was found that hackers, who according to the Threat Table, are characterized as driven by \"challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain\" were in fact, carrying out\ninformation gathering characterized as States' motivation under the Threat Table.[36]\nVery little has changed from the GAO's Threat Table since 2005.[37] Yet, cyber threat actors have continued to expand their operations in old and new ways.[38] Like criminal groups, Nation State actors, have \"moved toward targeting poorly configured or unpatched enterprise systems (VPN/VPS infrastructure, on-premises servers, third-party software) to perform living-off-the-land attacks.\"[39]\n# 3. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack attribution law and policy\nAttributing an attack to a particular source is one of the major challenges in cyberattack response.40 But to the ODNI, though difficult, it is not impossible.41 Just like characterization, there is also no clear international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks.42 Yet, international law, while it allows the use of force for self-defense,43 demands that such force must be directed against the attacker.44 Thus, to lawfully use a countermeasure in response to a cyberattack, the victim State must first attribute the attack to the perpetrator precisely.45\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\nBut, attribution is said to have received \"comparatively little attention\" under international law.46 Scholars have expressed concern about the lack of an international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks which it is believed, gives States the abilities to [wrongfully] name and shame another country as the cyber attacker without a guiding principle on evidence gathering, sources, manner and extent.47 For instance, it is believed that the U.S. holds the view that the attribution process does not need to follow any strict legal standard and that its obligation under international law does not require it to disclose details (such as sources, manner of gathering etc.) about the evidence used to support its attribution of cyberattacks to cyber threat actors.48\nAttribution involves the means by which the available evidence related to a cyberattack is organized, examined, and connected to a source.49 It is the identification of the cyber attacker.50 It generally involves a three-level analysis – the tactical (technical), the operational, and the strategic.51 But day by day, cyber attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their TTPs, making it more difficult to trace evidence to a particular source in order to attribute.52 For instance, in the SolarWinds cyber incidents, cyber attackers deployed malicious code to SolarWinds' Orion IT monitoring and management software used by government agencies across the world, including the U.S. government. The attackers used the U.S. domestic infrastructure, which made it more difficult to trace the source of the attack.53 Thus, it has been suggested that in the attribu\ntion process, \"who is to blame?\" can be more important than \"who did it?\".54\nNotwithstanding the preceding, the ODNI believes that all cyber operation leaves a trail.[55] Both the CTIC and private sector companies have developed tools to assist in making a precise attribution. Some of these include tradecraft, network traffic, computer log entries, malware collection, file timestamps, utilizing publicly available websites, blogs, and document repositories, among others.[56] Though, the availability of these artifacts does not, itself, guarantee a conclusive proof of the source of an attack.[57]\nThe cyber attributing body in the U.S. has transcended beyond the CTIC alone.[58] Now, private companies, notably, CrowdStrike,[59] FireEye,[60] Mandiant,[61] Microsoft,[62] among others, partake in attribution. For instance, in its 2022 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike reportd and attributed the activities of COZY BEAR to Russia. It noted that during its investigation, COZY BEAR operators used \"authentication cookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks.\"[63] Also, in its Digital Defense Report 2022, Microsoft made cyber attribution to States. Microsoft reported that it detected Russian network intrusion efforts against 128 organizations in 42 countries between February and June 2022 and that the U.S. was Russia's number one target.[64]\nAs for the CTIC, the DHS notes that there is generally no single agency that has \"the authorities, capabilities, and expertise to deal unilaterally with a significant cyber incident.\"[65] All the CTIC agencies work to complement the activities of each other. However, by the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive-United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD-41),[66] the DoJ, acting through the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), is the Federal lead agency for cyber threat response activities.[67] Attribution is listed as one of the cy\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\nber threat response activities in PPD-41. Thus, from this provision, the DoJ, FBI and NCIJTF need to work together to make an attribution. Nonetheless, from a complete reading of the PPD-41, the ODNI, DHS, and other CTIC agencies could contribute to the attribution analysis.\nInterestingly, under U.S. law, the Secretary to the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD) could also make attribution. By Executive Orders 13694 and 13757 (E.Os. 13694 and 13757), the property of any person attributed by the Secretary to the USTD, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to have conducted a cyberattack which constitutes a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the U.S., are blocked from transfer, exported, or withdrawn. The USTD, through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for instance, exercised its power under E.Os. 13694 and 13757 by blocking Park Jin Hyok's assets in 2018 after being linked to WannaCry. But as noted below, the lack of a single attributing agency calls for a change.\nThere are different attribution models which have been developed to aid the attribution process. A popular one is the Herbert Lin's model. The model adopts three levels in the attribution process, namely, machines, human operators, and the ultimate responsible party. The first level requires forensic investigation of machines. Here, logfiles and IP address may be examined to locate the source of the attack. The second level requires identifying the specific individual responsible for the attack. Here, to Lin, forensics alone is not sufficient. Investigators need to accumulate a set of clues – such as historical records, private online forum, authentication – to pin the attack on a specific individual. The last level requires identifying the entity an attacker works for: It could be for a terrorist group, government or alone. Here, one way to make this determination would be to interview the attacker. There is proof of usage of this model by private cybersecurity firms. On its part, in using the Lin's model, there are different ways the CTIC agencies could achieve this. First, the CTIC agencies could leverage on the efforts of the private sector companies. Second, the CTIC agencies could utilize some surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which allows surveillance for national security or foreign intelligence investigations against a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\nAccording to the ODNI, the CTIC's attribution process is modeled after some key indicators: Tradecraft, infrastructure, malware, and intent, with tradecraft the most important indicator in the attribution process because \"habits are more difficult to change than technical tools.\" While the ODNI's Guide to Cyber Attribution does not contain a layer of steps in the attribution process, the Guide contains all the Lin's tools. Apart from the Lin's Model, in complying with its international law obligation regarding attribution, the U.S. can also use both data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations and documentary evidence.\nCyber attribution is important, because without it, there would not be deterrence for cyber attackers. The U.S. attribution policies are modeled to achieve three goals, namely, public attribution; indictment; and sanction. Public attribution involves publicly naming a threat actor as the attacker. The principal aim of this approach is to publicly name and shame an attacker, especially States, with the view that the embarrassment from the naming and shaming, would deter the attacker from conducting another cyberattack. CTIC, especially CISA through its alert system, and private companies, have adopted this method. Sanctions and indictments have also been used by the U.S. government in concert with public attribution.\nIt is, however, generally agreed within the cyber community that the trio of public attribution, sanctions, and indictments, are not sufficient in achieving the attribution goal. This is true, considering that from the various recent reports by the CTIC and private sector companies, cyber threat actors continue to conduct cyberattacks against the U.S., despite public attributions, sanctions, and indictments against cyber attackers. Further, another gap in the U.S. laws and policies for attribution is the lack of a definitive standard of proof required to make attribution. Generally, it is extremely difficult in the attribution process to be almost certain about the source of a\n Id.\n Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Orders 13694 of April 1, 2015, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities.\n Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/cyber2_eo.pdf.\n DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Press Release: Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks, U.S. (Sept. 6, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm473.\n Lin, supra note 57.\n Id. at 81.\n Id. at 84.\n Id.\n Id. at 86-7\n Milton Mueller, Karl Grindal, Brenden Kuerbis &amp; Farzaneh Badiei, Cyber Attribution: Can a New Institution Achieve Transnational Credibility? 4(1) THE CYBER DEFENSE REV. 107, 108 (2019).\n Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 49.\n Lin, supra note 57, at 17.\n A Guide to Cyber Attribution, supra note 41, at 3.\n Id.\n Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Muchael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31(3) EUR.

Yet, in order to effectively respond to a cyberattack – particularly under international law – attribution must first be made by the States.\nThis attribution challenge is not exclusively a U.S. problem. This is a problem faced in all jurisdictions. More problematic is that international law does not provide a definite guide. International law has been accused of failing to “set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution.” Varying degrees of standards of proof have been laid by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for determining State responsibility under international law. The ICJ at various times has required exceptional gravity, fully conclusive and clear and convincing standard of proofs. Scholars believe that it is because of a lack of a single standard by the ICJ that the “Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be determined by the relevant forum.”\nAlthough scholars have clamored for a solution to the foregoing problem, “yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism.” Notwithstanding, eminent international law scholars have attempted to provide an international law standard for attribution of cyberattack. For instance, where the cyberattack is less serious, Tsagourias and Farrell argue that “preponderance of the evidence” is the most appropriate standard. They reasoned that both a very high standard, such as “beyond a reasonable doubt” and a low standard, may not ensure a balance. But where the attack is a cyberwar, and the victim State intends\nto respond with the use of force, Finlay and Payne, suggest the use of “a strict test of attribution.” Importantly, international law does not – and cannot – require absolute certainty in attribution. But it requires reasonability. For this reason, convincing circumstantial proof standard, is said to be sufficient. Most of the attribution made by the CTIC agencies and private sector, appears to adopt this standard, using the Lin’s model and the ODNI’s indicators.\nThere are many areas for improvement that appear from the U.S. cyberattack attribution policies and process described above. First, there is a lack of a single attributing agency. The danger with this is the potential disagreement in evidence gathering and attributing standards amongst the different CTIC agencies. One Bill – the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018 (CDRA) – currently pending before the Congress, which aims to “address state-sponsored cyber activities against the United States, and for other purpose,” rather than address the problem, compounds it by adding the President to the list of those who can attribute. By section 3(1), the President, acting through the Secretary of State, and in coordination with other relevant Federal agency heads, shall make attribution. The Bill does not designate a single Federal agency for attribution.\nSecond, there is no known procedure for making attribution. The CDRA also falls short of laying down any procedure. The danger here is that the absence of a known procedure affects the transparency, the due process of identifying the attacker and “could hamper the credibility of attribution more broadly.” Such absence is also susceptible to the use of unjustifiable countermeasure and self-defense under international law. Under international law, while Article 51 of the UN Charter codifies the customary international law right of a State to use self-defense if faced with an armed attack, such State must do so within clearly established principles, otherwise, it will become the aggressor.\nThird, the lack of a standardized procedure coupled with the participation of the private sector in attribution freely, is a cause for concern. Private entities like CrowdStrike, FireEye, Mandiant, SecureWork and Microsoft, have all released reports attributing cyberattacks to different threat actors, including States/State-sponsored entities. The potential dangers here are: First, there could be potential contradiction – where the CTIC could reach a different conclusion as to the source of an attack, while the private sector entities reach another. Second, there could be an interference with an on-\n Eichensehr, supra note 52, at 3.\n See for instance, Annegret Bendiek &amp; Matthias Schulze, Attribution: A Major Challenge for EU Cyber Sanctions: An Analysis of WannaCry, NotPetya, Cloud Hopper, Bundestag Hack and the Attack on the OPCW, SWP Research Paper 11 (2021).\n For discussion, see Tsagourias &amp; Farrell, supra note 82, at 965 (stating that “current attribution claims do not rely on any particular standard of proof and that international law is quite ambiguous in this regard.”).

For instance, in 2014, when the Sony data beach occurred, some private sector companies disagreed with the CTIC attribution of the attack to North Korea, arguing that it was an insider attack. Also, there was contradiction amongst the private sector companies over the Olympic Destroyer attack, where some believed that North Korea was initially responsible, while others believed it was Russia. Attribution is necessary because most of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation policies are aimed toward achieving deterrence. But there can be no effective deterrence without adequate attribution. Hence, the issues associated with attribution – difficulty, time and lack of a process – have invariably prevented achieving an effective retaliation.\n## 4. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation law and policy\nA State that has faced a cyberattack has varying options – both under its domestic legal system and international law – in retaliating the attack. For instance, under international law, there are typically four options available to the victim State: Self-defense, countermeasures, the plea of necessity, and retorsion. But the threshold required before using any of these options is fuzzy. It is, however, clear that the self-defense option is only available when a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or “use of force.”\nThere are a lot of scholarships on the applicability of international law principles on use of force to a situation where a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or use of force. But as conceptualized in this paper, a cyberattack does not escalate to the level of an armed attack. “To date,” state Finlay and Payne, “few if any of the known cyberattacks appear to meet the threshold for a ‘use of force,’ let alone for an ‘armed attack.’” In this situation – that is, where it is\na cyberattack and not a cyberwar – international law scholars are divided on the implications of this under international law. Notwithstanding, the impacts of cyberattacks – even if it falls short of an armed attack or use of force – can be significant. Therefore, cyberattack by its nature, violates the principles of non-intervention and sovereignty under international law. Hathaway, et al. provide a list of four other legal regimes that could regulate retaliation for cyberattacks, even if cyberattacks do not constitute an armed attack or use of force (cyberwar). This paper critiques the fourth legal regime – the U.S. domestic law and policy.\nThe U.S. cyber retaliation policies are not contained in a single policy document. There are several documents stipulating the goal of cyber retaliation, but none contains specific retaliation steps nor a set of retaliatory actions. The U.S. has consistently maintained that its aim in retaliating is to pass a message to cyber attackers “that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.” The U.S. cyber retaliation policies can be aggregated from its National Security Strategy, DoD Zero Trust Strategy, White House Statements, and the International Cyber Strategy. Some of the retaliation policies also appear in the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report. These are considered serially. First, the 2022 National Security Strategy states the aim of retaliation for cyberattack thus:\n“We aim to deter cyberattacks from state and non-state actors and will respond decisively with all appropriate tools of national power to hostile acts in cyberspace, including those that disrupt or degrade vital national functions or critical infrastructure. We will continue to promote adherence to the UN General Assembly-endorsed framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, which recognizes that international law applies online, just as it does offline.”\nIn the 2022 National Security Strategy, the U.S. states that it will adopt “Integrated Deterrence” in achieving its retaliation objectives. Integrated Deterrence recognizes that\n Id. at 479-80.\n Id. at 479.\n Id.\n See Clara Assumpção, The Problem of Cyber Attribution Between States 1 (2020) https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/83271 (stating that “attributing responsibility to who perpetrated an attack against a state and, even more importantly, who ordered it, is a way to achieve cyber deterrence”).\n Chris Jakaran, Cybersecurity: Deterrence Policy, (2022) Congressional Research Service 47011.\n Schmitt, supra note 45, at 244.\n Id.\n Finlay &amp; Payne, supra note 93, at 202.\n See for instance, Michael N.

According to the Strategy, Integrated Deterrence entails five integrations. First, integration across domains, which recognizes that cyber threat actors operate across \"military (land, air, maritime, cyber, and space) and non-military (economic, technological, and information) domains—and that we must too.\"132 Second, integration across regions, which entails an understanding that cyber threat actors \"combine expansive ambitions with growing capabilities to threaten U.S. interests in key regions and in the homeland.\"133 Third, integration across the spectrum of conflict which aims \"to prevent cyber threat actors from altering the status quo in ways that harm U.S. vital interests while hovering below the threshold of armed conflict.\"134 The Strategy also entails integration across the U.S. Government; and integration with allies and partners.135 The Strategy states that Integrated Deterrence \"requires us to more effectively coordinate, network, and innovate so that any competitor thinking about pressing for advantage in one domain understands that we can respond in many others as well. This augments the traditional backstop of combat-credible conventional and strategic capabilities.\"136 The Strategy, however, does not contain specific retaliation steps nor set of retaliatory actions.\nSecond, some statements from the White House contain some of the retaliation policies. The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cybersecurity, for instance, aims to \"lock our digital doors\" and \"take aggressive action to strengthen and safeguard our nation's cybersecurity, including imposing costs on and strengthening our security against malicious actors.\"137 The Statement mentions the sanctioning of Russian cyber actors affiliated with the Russian intelligence services in response to the SolarWinds attack. It also mentions the imposition of cost against Iran for its counter-normative attack on Albanian government systems.138 Thus, the Statement mentions two retaliation options the U.S. resorts to as response to a cyberattack: Sanction and cost. But the Statement is not comprehensive, nor does it define when either of the retaliation options would be resorted to.\nThird, under the International Cyber Strategy, 2011, there are four steps preparatory to retaliation. They are (1) the U.S. will participate fully in international cybercrime policy development; (2) Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to the Budapest Convention; (3) Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the internet; and (4) Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the internet for operational planning, financing, or attacks.139 The Strategy develops three\nmodels: development, diplomacy and defense  $(\\mathrm{D}_3)$ . Where an attack occurs from a non-State threat actors, the retaliation includes investigation, apprehension, and prosecution.140 The Strategy further provides that when warranted, the U.S. will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace like any other threat. But before doing so, the U.S. would exhaust all other options, like weighing the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction. Where the U.S. resorts to the use of military force, it would categorize this as self-defense, and could compel actions under its military treaties with other countries.141 Where it gets to this, the U.S. could \"use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\"142 While the Strategy mentions the retaliatory actions, they are not clearly defined.\nFourth, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report, 2020 (CSC Report), also contains some of the U.S. retaliation policies and recommends some. The CSC Report establishes the \"layered cyber deterrence.\"143 Under this structure, the U.S. must shape the behavior in cyberspace; the U.S. must deny benefits to the cyber threat actors; and the U.S. must impose costs as retaliation for cyberattacks.144 The CSC Report also makes some recommendations with respect to retaliation. It recommends that the U.S. \"announce a second declaratory policy which would clearly state that the U.S. would respond using cyber and non-cyber capabilities to counter and impose costs\" against cyber threat actors \"below a use-of-force threshold.\"145 It also recommends that the U.S. government should \"publicly declare that it will defend forward, and couple its declaration with decisive and consistent action.\"146 According to the CSC Report, defend forward \"posits that to disrupt and defeat ongoing adversary campaigns, the United States must proactively observe, pursue, and counter adversaries' operations and impose costs short of armed conflict.\"147 The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cyber appears to be one of such public declaration. But as stated above, the Statement is not comprehensive.\nMuch of the criticisms on the U.S. cyber retaliation policies relate to its lack of preciseness. Preciseness is important for two reasons: First, it informs cyber threat actors of the actions that would be taken in retaliation for a cyberattack; and secondly, it encourages public debates among citizens to critique the retaliation actions sought to be taken against cyber threat actors.148 Another criticism is that the current retaliation options used by the U.S. are not sufficient, as they have not deterred cyberattacks.149 For this, some cyber experts have\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\ndeveloped a cyber retaliation framework from the existing retaliation laws and policies, especially from the  $\\mathrm{D}_3$ . Yannakogeorgos, building on Healey's taxonomy, developed the below retaliation framework for State/State-sponsored attack:[150]\n|  Range of state activity | Development | Diplomacy | Defense  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  State prohibited | X |  |   |\n|  State prohibited but inadequate | X |  |   |\n|  State ignored | X | X |   |\n|  State encouraged |  | X |   |\n|  State shaped |  | X |   |\n|  State coordinated |  | X |   |\n|  State ordered |  |  | X  |\n|  State-rogue conducted |  |  | X  |\n|  State executed |  |  | X  |\n|  State integrated |  |  | X  |\nSource: Yannakogeorgos (2016) 'Strategy for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,' p. 55.\nThe above retaliation framework while useful, are not adhered to by the U.S. government in retaliation. Although, there are times when part of this framework has been adopted, one of the other criticisms of the U.S. cyber retaliation laws and policies is that the U.S. government is inconsistent in its application. Despite the several documents stipulating the U.S. cyber retaliation options, none contains specific retaliation steps. And despite these several documents, the U.S. continues to experience an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks. Law and policy recommendations addressing this will, thus, improve the retaliation policies.\n# 5. Law and policy recommendations\nIn this part, some law and policy recommendations on the gaps and criticisms identified above will be made.\n1. Law and Policy Recommendation for Characterization:\nA. Conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks to understand the current motivations for each TTPs. The actors for this should be the USCYBERCOM, FBI, CISA and DHS + private sector. This would encourage information sharing amongst the CTIC and the private sector. It would also lead to a faster and easier characterization process. With it, the CTIC would be able to quickly characterize a malfunction in the computer system or critical infrastructure as a cyberattack with the detection of the TTPs.\nB. Constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks. The actors for this should be the GAO, CISA and DHS. These actors should also work with the private sector in this regard. For instance, CrowdStrike's Threat Activity Table in its 2022 Report, includes \"generating currency to support a regime\" as\npart of the motivations for a State attack. $^{151}$  This recommendation is important because it would reflect the dynamics and changing nature of the motivations for cyberattacks. It would also assist with the appropriate cyber response and defense.\nC. Develop a joint characterization guideline (JCG) for cyberattacks. The recommended actors for this are CISA, DoJ, FBI and DHS. In the guideline, a rigid characterization description should be avoided. The JCG should be revised annually (or as appropriate, for instance, where a cyberattack necessitates the need to change something substantial). The JCG should avoid definitive characterization of an attack before a full-scale investigation. This recommendation is necessary to have a standardized approach for characterization. It would make the characterization process tidier.\n2. Law and Policy Recommendation for Attribution:\nA. Amend the CDRA before enactment. The actor for this is the Congress. The scope of the CDRA should be extended to cover other threat actors. The extant CDRA Bill deals with \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" However, majority of the cyberattacks against the U.S. are conducted by non-State threat actors.[152] The CDRA should create a body - The National Cyber Investigative Agency (NCIA) - and clothes it with the power to attribute to other cyber threat actors (other than State/State-sponsored actors) without the need for the President to make such attribution. The rationale for this law and policy is that the extant CDRA Bill covers only \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" It excludes cyberattacks by other cyber threat actors, who are equally a major threat. This recommendation would expand the scope of the CDRA to cover these other cyber threat actors. Also, under the CDRA, the President is empowered to make attribution for the \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" This recommendation recognizes that given the number of cyberattacks against the U.S. annually, the functionality of attributing all cyberattacks (when the scope of the CDRA is expanded) by the President is not feasible. This recommendation posits that the NCIA should instead, be tasked with attribution of other cyber threat actors.\nB. Designate the attribution function to a single agency - The NCIA. This recommendation may be done by the Congress through legislation (the CDRA could create the NCIA) or President through Executive Orders. One agency that may be reconstituted to the NCIA as an independent agency is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force.[153] All the CTIC agencies should\ncontinue providing supports in the attribution process as required by the NCIA. Only the NCIA should have the power to ultimately publicly attribute, though other CTIC agencies might publicize the attribution with the permission of NCIA. Also, the USTD should act on the attribution made by NCIA in blocking assets. In addition, the NCIA should be the advisory agency to the President in attributing cyberattacks to a State. The rationale for this recommendation is that in recent years, private sectors companies participate in the attributing of cyberattacks. As noted above in the Sony data beach and Olympic Destroyer attack, a lack of a coordinated attribution process may lead to contradictory attributions. This recommendation is aimed at addressing this. Also, this recommendation is apt to save cost and time in the attribution process. When a single agency (like the NCIA) is tasked with attribution, the cost and time expended by other CTIC agencies in attribution when aggregated will be reduced.\n2. Develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline (CAG). The NCIA should do this after its establishment. The CAG should stipulate the procedure for attribution. This would increase the transparency and credibility of the attribution process (due process). The CAG should also stipulate the requirements for private sector companies to make public attribution to States. It should require private sector companies to check with the NCIA before making public attributions to States/State-sponsored cyberattacks. The CAG may permit private sector companies to publicly make attribution with respect to other threat actors without consulting the NCIA. The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) should be under the NCIA. The rationale for this recommendation is that the JCDC was recently convened by the CISA to facilitate the relationship between the CTIC agencies and private sector companies in the attribution process.154 An effective collaboration between the public/private sectors requires a flexible terrain for the private sector.155 This recommendation posits that the CAG should be a document which clearly defines the assistance available to the private sector companies from the NCIA and other CTIC agencies in the attribution process.\n3. Law and Policy Recommendation on Retaliation\n1. Develop a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks. This may be done by the Congress through legislation; the President through Executive Orders or the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). The C_{3}RT would inform potential cyber threat actors the consequences of carrying out cyberattacks against the U.S. To be effective, the U.S. should strictly abide by it in retaliating. The C_{3}RT should contain very strict punishments for cyber threat actors. It should factor the range of State activity in the Yannako-georgos and Healey's retaliation framework in setting the severity of the retaliation. The EU has adopted this method through its “Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox.”156\n2. Develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES). The ONCD should be the lead actor for this. The ONCD should work on updating the National Cyber Strategy, 2018 as per its enabling statute -- the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.157 The National Cyber Strategy should contain the enforcement strategy. The C_{2}ES should include steps to strengthen the existing relationship with the EU and other U.S. allies. The C_{2}ES may build on the D_{3} of the International Cyber Strategy, 2011.\n3. Introduce new retaliatory actions in the C_{3}RT beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment. This could include hack-back in case the cyberattack is by a State/State-sponsored.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper considers three of the most important questions in responding to cyberattacks. These are characterization, attribution, and retaliation. It found that the U.S. characterization process is not clear, nor is there an international framework for characterization. The paper however, found that the GOA Threat Table, 2021, characterizes the motivations by cyber threat actors in carrying out cyberattacks. This table is not so much different from the GAO's Threat Table, 2005. Yet, recent studies reveal that cyber threat actors constantly change their TTP and could conceal their true motivation, in order to prevent the U.S. from appropriately responding to a cyberattack. To address this problem, the paper thus, recommends three things: (1) the CTIC should conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks; (2) the CTIC should constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks; and (3) a JCG for cyberattacks should be developed. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a clear attribution procedure. There is also no single agency with the power to attribute, with virtually all the CTIC agencies having the power to attribute. Also, private sector companies participate freely in attribution. The paper discusses the dangers with these and makes three recommendations: (1) the CDRA should be amended before enactment to extend its scope to cover other cyber threat actors; (2) the attribution function should be designated a single agency -- the NCIA; and (3) the NCIA should develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline which will set forth the requirements\nand regulations for private sector companies that attribute cyberattacks. Unlike both characterization and attribution, there are several documents containing the U.S. retaliation policies. But these documents do not contain specific steps in retaliating. The policies lack preciseness. The paper thus, recommends (1) the development of a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks; (2) the ONCD should develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES) and (3) the C_{3}RT should introduce other retaliatory actions beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment.\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.",

Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response.\n© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n# 1. Introduction\nThe definition of the term \"cyberattack,\" though, contained in different scholarly works, $^{1}$  is often equated to a lesser form, called \"cybercrime,\" and a more intense form, called \"cyber\nwar.\" The most prominent definition of cyberattack describes it as an attack initiated from a computer against a website, computer system or critical infrastructure, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the attacked computer or information stored on it. The Department of Defense (DoD) adopted the following comprehensive\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105847\n0267-3649/© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The intended effects of cyberattacks are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyberattack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyberattack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.\nWhen carried out, it aims to disrupt, disable, destroy, interfere, steal or control the data, information and functionality of the attacked computer or critical infrastructure. Generally, these attacks may be carried out by individuals, acting alone, or with others; terrorist organizations; non-state actors working for a State; or by State agencies – a prominent example of which was Russia's interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election using series of cyberattacks coordinated by State agencies.\nCyberattacks have taken different spectrums over the years, and the U.S. defense agencies have identified them. These include Network Denial, Enterprise Denial, Enterprise Manipulation, Mission Denial, and Mission Manipulation. The methods of carrying out cyberattacks are numerous. A consideration of these methods is outside the scope of this paper. But they deserve mention:\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Phishing attacks\n- Drive-by-download attack\n- Password Attack\n- SQL Injection Attack\n- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\n- Eavesdropping attack\nThis paper focuses on cyberattack, as distinguished from cybercrime and cyberwar. One of the best efforts showing the distinction amongst the concepts of cyberattack, cybercrime and cyberwar is that of Hathaway et al. in the paper, The Law of Cyber-Attack. To the authors, a cyberattack is “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.” To this end, any attack that is “not carried out for a political or national security purpose, such as most instances of internet fraud, identity theft, and intellectual property piracy, does not fit this final element of a “cyberattack” and is therefore mere cyber-crime.”\nAlso, cyberattacks are distinguishable from cyberwar. To Hathaway et al., ‘cyber-warfare’ is... a term properly used only to refer to the small subset of cyber-attacks that do constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict. From this distinction, a cyberattack may not constitute an armed attack under international law and thus, the retaliation to it is expected to fall short of an armed response. Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, attacks on any of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by the Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which though, do not have an effects equivalent to an “armed attack,” are classified as cyberattacks. This is because attacks on critical infrastructures pose a national security challenge as it may be injurious to both the people and the environment – for instance, the hacking of a critical infrastructure which releases toxic substance. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the U.S. experienced an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks in 2021, with the critical infrastructures a major target.\n DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, Memorandum for Chiefs of the Military Services, Commanders of the Combatant Commands and Directors of the Joint Staff Directorates (2011) https://info.publicintelligence.net/DoD-JointCyberTerms.pdf.\n Michael Power, Michael Pease, Keith Stouffer, CheeYee Tang, Timothy Zimmerman, Joseph Brule, et al.

Cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation, are related in some way. For instance, some scholars have classified characterization as part of the attribution process and to them, characterization is the attribution of cyberattacks to classes of adversaries.[18] These three processes are necessary in responding to cyberattacks and developing a robust cyber defense system.[19]\nThis paper is divided into six sections. After this introduction, Section 2 will focus on the U.S. characterization policies. Section 3 deals with attribution policies of cyberattacks against the U.S. Section 4 discusses the retaliation policies for cyberattacks against the U.S. The paper seeks to synthesize and answer the unanswered law and policy questions on characterization, attribution, and retaliation. To this end, the paper will critique the existing U.S. laws and policies on cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation. Section 5 will recommend laws and policies to address the identified gaps. Section 6 – the conclusion – will summarize the paper.\n# 2. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack characterization law and policy\nThe characterization process for cyberattacks by the U.S. intelligence and military agencies is not clear. There is equally no international standard for characterization.[20] In simple terms, characterization means the interpretation given to the abnormality that occurs to the proper functioning of a computer system.[21] Generally, the proper functioning of a computer system may be disrupted for different reasons, such as, human error, natural events or it may be deliberate (an attack). Where it is an attack, characterization is usually determined by the extent of the consequences of the attack.[22] Characterization is important in the response process for two main reasons. First, it shapes how to respond to the cyberattack. For instance, where it is determined that the attack is malicious, characterization will help in the deployment of appropriate response. Secondly, characterization is important to strengthen the cyber defense.[23]\nAn attack may be characterized in different ways: It may be for financial gains; for espionage; for service disruption; shaming; information gathering, among other. To characterize, the U.S. cyber threat intelligence community (CTIC)[24] and private sector companies, as a preliminary step, usually identify the potential source of the attack in order to monitor and determine how to respond to such attack. This has proved difficult, as the U.S. has continued to research the blueprints of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors, (that is, highly motivated, sophisticated, and organized threat groups).[25] For instance, between March and October 2021, the CTIC monitored Iranian government-sponsored APT actors. In March 2021, the FBI and CISA first observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors leverage Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet vulnerabilities to target a broad range of victims across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in furtherance of malicious activities. The monitoring continued till October 2021 before CISA finally publicly announced it in November 2021.[26]\nAlso, the FANCY BEAR adversary associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special Services (Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate), was first identified as initially using extensively spear-phishing emails containing \"malicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure when conducting cyberattacks\"27 but thereafter reevaluated \"its operational tradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use of credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and victim-tailored phishing websites.\"28\nOver the years, the U.S. intelligence community and other cyber defenders have utilized different tools to identify the potential source of an attack in order to characterize it. These tools are used to understand the activities of the cyber threat actors which are useful for characterization purposes. These tools include intrusion detection systems (IDS), anomaly behavior detection tools, firewalls, IP addresses and forensic analysis of malware.[29] The Government Accountability Office (GAO), CISA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a threat table characterizing each form of attacks by different threat actors (the Threat Table).[30] The Threat Table, contained in the GAO's March 2021 High-Risk Series, characterizes the motivations by criminal groups, hackers and hacktivists, insiders, nations and terrorist in the following manner:\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\n|  Threat actor | Description  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Criminal Group | Criminal groups seek to attack systems for monetary gain. Specifically, criminal groups use cyber exploits to commit identity theft, online fraud, and computer extortion. According to the 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment, criminal groups increasingly target U.S. critical infrastructure to generate profit, whether through ransomware, email impersonation fraud, social engineering, or malware.  |\n|  Hackers and hacktivists | Hackers break into networks for the challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain, among other reasons. By contrast, hacktivists are ideologically motivated actors who use cyber exploits to further political goals.  |\n|  Nation | Nations, including groups or programs sponsored or sanctioned by nation-states, use cyber tools as part of their information gathering and espionage activities.  |\n|  Terrorist | Terrorists seek to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit critical infrastructures in order to threaten national security, cause mass casualties, weaken the economy, and damage public morale and confidence.  |\n|  Source: GAO-21-288.31  |   |\nWhile generally, the Threat Table is an important tool in characterization, recent activities of cyber threat actors show that these actors do not necessarily conduct cyberattacks in accordance with the descriptions in the Threat Table. Thus, a strict adherence to the Threat Table may be outdated. For instance, according to the GAO and DHS's estimation in the Threat Table, terrorist groups \"do not currently have the sophisticated tools or skill necessary to execute a cyberattack that could cause a widespread outage or significantly damage the power system.\"32 If an attack significantly causes damage to the system, from this characterization, terrorists may be removed from the equation. But this potentially poses two dangers. First, it can limit the cyber response necessary for an attack. Secondly, it may lead to an embarrassing situation, \"if and when it is proven to have originated from more benign—if not necessarily less ominous (in terms of consequences)—causes.\"33 The Microsoft's Digital Defence Report, 2021, for instance, reveals the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) deployed by States like Russia and China,34 which make it dangerous to abide strictly by the Threat Table in the characterization process. Microsoft reported that in many instances, attackers did not conceal their actions, but concealed their intentions.35 It was found that hackers, who according to the Threat Table, are characterized as driven by \"challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain\" were in fact, carrying out\ninformation gathering characterized as States' motivation under the Threat Table.[36]\nVery little has changed from the GAO's Threat Table since 2005.[37] Yet, cyber threat actors have continued to expand their operations in old and new ways.[38] Like criminal groups, Nation State actors, have \"moved toward targeting poorly configured or unpatched enterprise systems (VPN/VPS infrastructure, on-premises servers, third-party software) to perform living-off-the-land attacks.\"[39]\n# 3. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack attribution law and policy\nAttributing an attack to a particular source is one of the major challenges in cyberattack response.40 But to the ODNI, though difficult, it is not impossible.41 Just like characterization, there is also no clear international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks.42 Yet, international law, while it allows the use of force for self-defense,43 demands that such force must be directed against the attacker.44 Thus, to lawfully use a countermeasure in response to a cyberattack, the victim State must first attribute the attack to the perpetrator precisely.45\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\nBut, attribution is said to have received \"comparatively little attention\" under international law.46 Scholars have expressed concern about the lack of an international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks which it is believed, gives States the abilities to [wrongfully] name and shame another country as the cyber attacker without a guiding principle on evidence gathering, sources, manner and extent.47 For instance, it is believed that the U.S. holds the view that the attribution process does not need to follow any strict legal standard and that its obligation under international law does not require it to disclose details (such as sources, manner of gathering etc.) about the evidence used to support its attribution of cyberattacks to cyber threat actors.48\nAttribution involves the means by which the available evidence related to a cyberattack is organized, examined, and connected to a source.49 It is the identification of the cyber attacker.50 It generally involves a three-level analysis – the tactical (technical), the operational, and the strategic.51 But day by day, cyber attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their TTPs, making it more difficult to trace evidence to a particular source in order to attribute.52 For instance, in the SolarWinds cyber incidents, cyber attackers deployed malicious code to SolarWinds' Orion IT monitoring and management software used by government agencies across the world, including the U.S. government. The attackers used the U.S. domestic infrastructure, which made it more difficult to trace the source of the attack.53 Thus, it has been suggested that in the attribu\ntion process, \"who is to blame?\" can be more important than \"who did it?\".54\nNotwithstanding the preceding, the ODNI believes that all cyber operation leaves a trail.[55] Both the CTIC and private sector companies have developed tools to assist in making a precise attribution. Some of these include tradecraft, network traffic, computer log entries, malware collection, file timestamps, utilizing publicly available websites, blogs, and document repositories, among others.[56] Though, the availability of these artifacts does not, itself, guarantee a conclusive proof of the source of an attack.[57]\nThe cyber attributing body in the U.S. has transcended beyond the CTIC alone.[58] Now, private companies, notably, CrowdStrike,[59] FireEye,[60] Mandiant,[61] Microsoft,[62] among others, partake in attribution. For instance, in its 2022 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike reportd and attributed the activities of COZY BEAR to Russia. It noted that during its investigation, COZY BEAR operators used \"authentication cookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks.\"[63] Also, in its Digital Defense Report 2022, Microsoft made cyber attribution to States. Microsoft reported that it detected Russian network intrusion efforts against 128 organizations in 42 countries between February and June 2022 and that the U.S. was Russia's number one target.[64]\nAs for the CTIC, the DHS notes that there is generally no single agency that has \"the authorities, capabilities, and expertise to deal unilaterally with a significant cyber incident.\"[65] All the CTIC agencies work to complement the activities of each other. However, by the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive-United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD-41),[66] the DoJ, acting through the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), is the Federal lead agency for cyber threat response activities.[67] Attribution is listed as one of the cy\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\nber threat response activities in PPD-41. Thus, from this provision, the DoJ, FBI and NCIJTF need to work together to make an attribution. Nonetheless, from a complete reading of the PPD-41, the ODNI, DHS, and other CTIC agencies could contribute to the attribution analysis.\nInterestingly, under U.S. law, the Secretary to the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD) could also make attribution. By Executive Orders 13694 and 13757 (E.Os. 13694 and 13757), the property of any person attributed by the Secretary to the USTD, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to have conducted a cyberattack which constitutes a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the U.S., are blocked from transfer, exported, or withdrawn. The USTD, through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for instance, exercised its power under E.Os. 13694 and 13757 by blocking Park Jin Hyok's assets in 2018 after being linked to WannaCry. But as noted below, the lack of a single attributing agency calls for a change.\nThere are different attribution models which have been developed to aid the attribution process. A popular one is the Herbert Lin's model. The model adopts three levels in the attribution process, namely, machines, human operators, and the ultimate responsible party. The first level requires forensic investigation of machines. Here, logfiles and IP address may be examined to locate the source of the attack. The second level requires identifying the specific individual responsible for the attack. Here, to Lin, forensics alone is not sufficient. Investigators need to accumulate a set of clues – such as historical records, private online forum, authentication – to pin the attack on a specific individual. The last level requires identifying the entity an attacker works for: It could be for a terrorist group, government or alone. Here, one way to make this determination would be to interview the attacker. There is proof of usage of this model by private cybersecurity firms. On its part, in using the Lin's model, there are different ways the CTIC agencies could achieve this. First, the CTIC agencies could leverage on the efforts of the private sector companies. Second, the CTIC agencies could utilize some surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which allows surveillance for national security or foreign intelligence investigations against a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\nAccording to the ODNI, the CTIC's attribution process is modeled after some key indicators: Tradecraft, infrastructure, malware, and intent, with tradecraft the most important indicator in the attribution process because \"habits are more difficult to change than technical tools.\" While the ODNI's Guide to Cyber Attribution does not contain a layer of steps in the attribution process, the Guide contains all the Lin's tools. Apart from the Lin's Model, in complying with its international law obligation regarding attribution, the U.S. can also use both data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations and documentary evidence.\nCyber attribution is important, because without it, there would not be deterrence for cyber attackers. The U.S. attribution policies are modeled to achieve three goals, namely, public attribution; indictment; and sanction. Public attribution involves publicly naming a threat actor as the attacker. The principal aim of this approach is to publicly name and shame an attacker, especially States, with the view that the embarrassment from the naming and shaming, would deter the attacker from conducting another cyberattack. CTIC, especially CISA through its alert system, and private companies, have adopted this method. Sanctions and indictments have also been used by the U.S. government in concert with public attribution.\nIt is, however, generally agreed within the cyber community that the trio of public attribution, sanctions, and indictments, are not sufficient in achieving the attribution goal. This is true, considering that from the various recent reports by the CTIC and private sector companies, cyber threat actors continue to conduct cyberattacks against the U.S., despite public attributions, sanctions, and indictments against cyber attackers. Further, another gap in the U.S. laws and policies for attribution is the lack of a definitive standard of proof required to make attribution. Generally, it is extremely difficult in the attribution process to be almost certain about the source of a\n Id.\n Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Orders 13694 of April 1, 2015, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities.\n Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/cyber2_eo.pdf.\n DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Press Release: Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks, U.S. (Sept. 6, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm473.\n Lin, supra note 57.\n Id. at 81.\n Id. at 84.\n Id.\n Id. at 86-7\n Milton Mueller, Karl Grindal, Brenden Kuerbis &amp; Farzaneh Badiei, Cyber Attribution: Can a New Institution Achieve Transnational Credibility? 4(1) THE CYBER DEFENSE REV. 107, 108 (2019).\n Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 49.\n Lin, supra note 57, at 17.\n A Guide to Cyber Attribution, supra note 41, at 3.\n Id.\n Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Muchael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31(3) EUR.

Yet, in order to effectively respond to a cyberattack – particularly under international law – attribution must first be made by the States.\nThis attribution challenge is not exclusively a U.S. problem. This is a problem faced in all jurisdictions. More problematic is that international law does not provide a definite guide. International law has been accused of failing to “set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution.” Varying degrees of standards of proof have been laid by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for determining State responsibility under international law. The ICJ at various times has required exceptional gravity, fully conclusive and clear and convincing standard of proofs. Scholars believe that it is because of a lack of a single standard by the ICJ that the “Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be determined by the relevant forum.”\nAlthough scholars have clamored for a solution to the foregoing problem, “yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism.” Notwithstanding, eminent international law scholars have attempted to provide an international law standard for attribution of cyberattack. For instance, where the cyberattack is less serious, Tsagourias and Farrell argue that “preponderance of the evidence” is the most appropriate standard. They reasoned that both a very high standard, such as “beyond a reasonable doubt” and a low standard, may not ensure a balance. But where the attack is a cyberwar, and the victim State intends\nto respond with the use of force, Finlay and Payne, suggest the use of “a strict test of attribution.” Importantly, international law does not – and cannot – require absolute certainty in attribution. But it requires reasonability. For this reason, convincing circumstantial proof standard, is said to be sufficient. Most of the attribution made by the CTIC agencies and private sector, appears to adopt this standard, using the Lin’s model and the ODNI’s indicators.\nThere are many areas for improvement that appear from the U.S. cyberattack attribution policies and process described above. First, there is a lack of a single attributing agency. The danger with this is the potential disagreement in evidence gathering and attributing standards amongst the different CTIC agencies. One Bill – the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018 (CDRA) – currently pending before the Congress, which aims to “address state-sponsored cyber activities against the United States, and for other purpose,” rather than address the problem, compounds it by adding the President to the list of those who can attribute. By section 3(1), the President, acting through the Secretary of State, and in coordination with other relevant Federal agency heads, shall make attribution. The Bill does not designate a single Federal agency for attribution.\nSecond, there is no known procedure for making attribution. The CDRA also falls short of laying down any procedure. The danger here is that the absence of a known procedure affects the transparency, the due process of identifying the attacker and “could hamper the credibility of attribution more broadly.” Such absence is also susceptible to the use of unjustifiable countermeasure and self-defense under international law. Under international law, while Article 51 of the UN Charter codifies the customary international law right of a State to use self-defense if faced with an armed attack, such State must do so within clearly established principles, otherwise, it will become the aggressor.\nThird, the lack of a standardized procedure coupled with the participation of the private sector in attribution freely, is a cause for concern. Private entities like CrowdStrike, FireEye, Mandiant, SecureWork and Microsoft, have all released reports attributing cyberattacks to different threat actors, including States/State-sponsored entities. The potential dangers here are: First, there could be potential contradiction – where the CTIC could reach a different conclusion as to the source of an attack, while the private sector entities reach another. Second, there could be an interference with an on-\n Eichensehr, supra note 52, at 3.\n See for instance, Annegret Bendiek &amp; Matthias Schulze, Attribution: A Major Challenge for EU Cyber Sanctions: An Analysis of WannaCry, NotPetya, Cloud Hopper, Bundestag Hack and the Attack on the OPCW, SWP Research Paper 11 (2021).\n For discussion, see Tsagourias &amp; Farrell, supra note 82, at 965 (stating that “current attribution claims do not rely on any particular standard of proof and that international law is quite ambiguous in this regard.”).

For instance, in 2014, when the Sony data beach occurred, some private sector companies disagreed with the CTIC attribution of the attack to North Korea, arguing that it was an insider attack. Also, there was contradiction amongst the private sector companies over the Olympic Destroyer attack, where some believed that North Korea was initially responsible, while others believed it was Russia. Attribution is necessary because most of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation policies are aimed toward achieving deterrence. But there can be no effective deterrence without adequate attribution. Hence, the issues associated with attribution – difficulty, time and lack of a process – have invariably prevented achieving an effective retaliation.\n## 4. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation law and policy\nA State that has faced a cyberattack has varying options – both under its domestic legal system and international law – in retaliating the attack. For instance, under international law, there are typically four options available to the victim State: Self-defense, countermeasures, the plea of necessity, and retorsion. But the threshold required before using any of these options is fuzzy. It is, however, clear that the self-defense option is only available when a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or “use of force.”\nThere are a lot of scholarships on the applicability of international law principles on use of force to a situation where a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or use of force. But as conceptualized in this paper, a cyberattack does not escalate to the level of an armed attack. “To date,” state Finlay and Payne, “few if any of the known cyberattacks appear to meet the threshold for a ‘use of force,’ let alone for an ‘armed attack.’” In this situation – that is, where it is\na cyberattack and not a cyberwar – international law scholars are divided on the implications of this under international law. Notwithstanding, the impacts of cyberattacks – even if it falls short of an armed attack or use of force – can be significant. Therefore, cyberattack by its nature, violates the principles of non-intervention and sovereignty under international law. Hathaway, et al. provide a list of four other legal regimes that could regulate retaliation for cyberattacks, even if cyberattacks do not constitute an armed attack or use of force (cyberwar). This paper critiques the fourth legal regime – the U.S. domestic law and policy.\nThe U.S. cyber retaliation policies are not contained in a single policy document. There are several documents stipulating the goal of cyber retaliation, but none contains specific retaliation steps nor a set of retaliatory actions. The U.S. has consistently maintained that its aim in retaliating is to pass a message to cyber attackers “that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.” The U.S. cyber retaliation policies can be aggregated from its National Security Strategy, DoD Zero Trust Strategy, White House Statements, and the International Cyber Strategy. Some of the retaliation policies also appear in the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report. These are considered serially. First, the 2022 National Security Strategy states the aim of retaliation for cyberattack thus:\n“We aim to deter cyberattacks from state and non-state actors and will respond decisively with all appropriate tools of national power to hostile acts in cyberspace, including those that disrupt or degrade vital national functions or critical infrastructure. We will continue to promote adherence to the UN General Assembly-endorsed framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, which recognizes that international law applies online, just as it does offline.”\nIn the 2022 National Security Strategy, the U.S. states that it will adopt “Integrated Deterrence” in achieving its retaliation objectives. Integrated Deterrence recognizes that\n Id. at 479-80.\n Id. at 479.\n Id.\n See Clara Assumpção, The Problem of Cyber Attribution Between States 1 (2020) https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/83271 (stating that “attributing responsibility to who perpetrated an attack against a state and, even more importantly, who ordered it, is a way to achieve cyber deterrence”).\n Chris Jakaran, Cybersecurity: Deterrence Policy, (2022) Congressional Research Service 47011.\n Schmitt, supra note 45, at 244.\n Id.\n Finlay &amp; Payne, supra note 93, at 202.\n See for instance, Michael N.

According to the Strategy, Integrated Deterrence entails five integrations. First, integration across domains, which recognizes that cyber threat actors operate across \"military (land, air, maritime, cyber, and space) and non-military (economic, technological, and information) domains—and that we must too.\"132 Second, integration across regions, which entails an understanding that cyber threat actors \"combine expansive ambitions with growing capabilities to threaten U.S. interests in key regions and in the homeland.\"133 Third, integration across the spectrum of conflict which aims \"to prevent cyber threat actors from altering the status quo in ways that harm U.S. vital interests while hovering below the threshold of armed conflict.\"134 The Strategy also entails integration across the U.S. Government; and integration with allies and partners.135 The Strategy states that Integrated Deterrence \"requires us to more effectively coordinate, network, and innovate so that any competitor thinking about pressing for advantage in one domain understands that we can respond in many others as well. This augments the traditional backstop of combat-credible conventional and strategic capabilities.\"136 The Strategy, however, does not contain specific retaliation steps nor set of retaliatory actions.\nSecond, some statements from the White House contain some of the retaliation policies. The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cybersecurity, for instance, aims to \"lock our digital doors\" and \"take aggressive action to strengthen and safeguard our nation's cybersecurity, including imposing costs on and strengthening our security against malicious actors.\"137 The Statement mentions the sanctioning of Russian cyber actors affiliated with the Russian intelligence services in response to the SolarWinds attack. It also mentions the imposition of cost against Iran for its counter-normative attack on Albanian government systems.138 Thus, the Statement mentions two retaliation options the U.S. resorts to as response to a cyberattack: Sanction and cost. But the Statement is not comprehensive, nor does it define when either of the retaliation options would be resorted to.\nThird, under the International Cyber Strategy, 2011, there are four steps preparatory to retaliation. They are (1) the U.S. will participate fully in international cybercrime policy development; (2) Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to the Budapest Convention; (3) Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the internet; and (4) Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the internet for operational planning, financing, or attacks.139 The Strategy develops three\nmodels: development, diplomacy and defense  $(\\mathrm{D}_3)$ . Where an attack occurs from a non-State threat actors, the retaliation includes investigation, apprehension, and prosecution.140 The Strategy further provides that when warranted, the U.S. will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace like any other threat. But before doing so, the U.S. would exhaust all other options, like weighing the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction. Where the U.S. resorts to the use of military force, it would categorize this as self-defense, and could compel actions under its military treaties with other countries.141 Where it gets to this, the U.S. could \"use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\"142 While the Strategy mentions the retaliatory actions, they are not clearly defined.\nFourth, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report, 2020 (CSC Report), also contains some of the U.S. retaliation policies and recommends some. The CSC Report establishes the \"layered cyber deterrence.\"143 Under this structure, the U.S. must shape the behavior in cyberspace; the U.S. must deny benefits to the cyber threat actors; and the U.S. must impose costs as retaliation for cyberattacks.144 The CSC Report also makes some recommendations with respect to retaliation. It recommends that the U.S. \"announce a second declaratory policy which would clearly state that the U.S. would respond using cyber and non-cyber capabilities to counter and impose costs\" against cyber threat actors \"below a use-of-force threshold.\"145 It also recommends that the U.S. government should \"publicly declare that it will defend forward, and couple its declaration with decisive and consistent action.\"146 According to the CSC Report, defend forward \"posits that to disrupt and defeat ongoing adversary campaigns, the United States must proactively observe, pursue, and counter adversaries' operations and impose costs short of armed conflict.\"147 The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cyber appears to be one of such public declaration. But as stated above, the Statement is not comprehensive.\nMuch of the criticisms on the U.S. cyber retaliation policies relate to its lack of preciseness. Preciseness is important for two reasons: First, it informs cyber threat actors of the actions that would be taken in retaliation for a cyberattack; and secondly, it encourages public debates among citizens to critique the retaliation actions sought to be taken against cyber threat actors.148 Another criticism is that the current retaliation options used by the U.S. are not sufficient, as they have not deterred cyberattacks.149 For this, some cyber experts have\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\ndeveloped a cyber retaliation framework from the existing retaliation laws and policies, especially from the  $\\mathrm{D}_3$ . Yannakogeorgos, building on Healey's taxonomy, developed the below retaliation framework for State/State-sponsored attack:[150]\n|  Range of state activity | Development | Diplomacy | Defense  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  State prohibited | X |  |   |\n|  State prohibited but inadequate | X |  |   |\n|  State ignored | X | X |   |\n|  State encouraged |  | X |   |\n|  State shaped |  | X |   |\n|  State coordinated |  | X |   |\n|  State ordered |  |  | X  |\n|  State-rogue conducted |  |  | X  |\n|  State executed |  |  | X  |\n|  State integrated |  |  | X  |\nSource: Yannakogeorgos (2016) 'Strategy for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,' p. 55.\nThe above retaliation framework while useful, are not adhered to by the U.S. government in retaliation. Although, there are times when part of this framework has been adopted, one of the other criticisms of the U.S. cyber retaliation laws and policies is that the U.S. government is inconsistent in its application. Despite the several documents stipulating the U.S. cyber retaliation options, none contains specific retaliation steps. And despite these several documents, the U.S. continues to experience an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks. Law and policy recommendations addressing this will, thus, improve the retaliation policies.\n# 5. Law and policy recommendations\nIn this part, some law and policy recommendations on the gaps and criticisms identified above will be made.\n1. Law and Policy Recommendation for Characterization:\nA. Conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks to understand the current motivations for each TTPs. The actors for this should be the USCYBERCOM, FBI, CISA and DHS + private sector. This would encourage information sharing amongst the CTIC and the private sector. It would also lead to a faster and easier characterization process. With it, the CTIC would be able to quickly characterize a malfunction in the computer system or critical infrastructure as a cyberattack with the detection of the TTPs.\nB. Constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks. The actors for this should be the GAO, CISA and DHS. These actors should also work with the private sector in this regard. For instance, CrowdStrike's Threat Activity Table in its 2022 Report, includes \"generating currency to support a regime\" as\npart of the motivations for a State attack. $^{151}$  This recommendation is important because it would reflect the dynamics and changing nature of the motivations for cyberattacks. It would also assist with the appropriate cyber response and defense.\nC. Develop a joint characterization guideline (JCG) for cyberattacks. The recommended actors for this are CISA, DoJ, FBI and DHS. In the guideline, a rigid characterization description should be avoided. The JCG should be revised annually (or as appropriate, for instance, where a cyberattack necessitates the need to change something substantial). The JCG should avoid definitive characterization of an attack before a full-scale investigation. This recommendation is necessary to have a standardized approach for characterization. It would make the characterization process tidier.\n2. Law and Policy Recommendation for Attribution:\nA. Amend the CDRA before enactment. The actor for this is the Congress. The scope of the CDRA should be extended to cover other threat actors. The extant CDRA Bill deals with \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" However, majority of the cyberattacks against the U.S. are conducted by non-State threat actors.[152] The CDRA should create a body - The National Cyber Investigative Agency (NCIA) - and clothes it with the power to attribute to other cyber threat actors (other than State/State-sponsored actors) without the need for the President to make such attribution. The rationale for this law and policy is that the extant CDRA Bill covers only \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" It excludes cyberattacks by other cyber threat actors, who are equally a major threat. This recommendation would expand the scope of the CDRA to cover these other cyber threat actors. Also, under the CDRA, the President is empowered to make attribution for the \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" This recommendation recognizes that given the number of cyberattacks against the U.S. annually, the functionality of attributing all cyberattacks (when the scope of the CDRA is expanded) by the President is not feasible. This recommendation posits that the NCIA should instead, be tasked with attribution of other cyber threat actors.\nB. Designate the attribution function to a single agency - The NCIA. This recommendation may be done by the Congress through legislation (the CDRA could create the NCIA) or President through Executive Orders. One agency that may be reconstituted to the NCIA as an independent agency is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force.[153] All the CTIC agencies should\ncontinue providing supports in the attribution process as required by the NCIA. Only the NCIA should have the power to ultimately publicly attribute, though other CTIC agencies might publicize the attribution with the permission of NCIA. Also, the USTD should act on the attribution made by NCIA in blocking assets. In addition, the NCIA should be the advisory agency to the President in attributing cyberattacks to a State. The rationale for this recommendation is that in recent years, private sectors companies participate in the attributing of cyberattacks. As noted above in the Sony data beach and Olympic Destroyer attack, a lack of a coordinated attribution process may lead to contradictory attributions. This recommendation is aimed at addressing this. Also, this recommendation is apt to save cost and time in the attribution process. When a single agency (like the NCIA) is tasked with attribution, the cost and time expended by other CTIC agencies in attribution when aggregated will be reduced.\n2. Develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline (CAG). The NCIA should do this after its establishment. The CAG should stipulate the procedure for attribution. This would increase the transparency and credibility of the attribution process (due process). The CAG should also stipulate the requirements for private sector companies to make public attribution to States. It should require private sector companies to check with the NCIA before making public attributions to States/State-sponsored cyberattacks. The CAG may permit private sector companies to publicly make attribution with respect to other threat actors without consulting the NCIA. The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) should be under the NCIA. The rationale for this recommendation is that the JCDC was recently convened by the CISA to facilitate the relationship between the CTIC agencies and private sector companies in the attribution process.154 An effective collaboration between the public/private sectors requires a flexible terrain for the private sector.155 This recommendation posits that the CAG should be a document which clearly defines the assistance available to the private sector companies from the NCIA and other CTIC agencies in the attribution process.\n3. Law and Policy Recommendation on Retaliation\n1. Develop a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks. This may be done by the Congress through legislation; the President through Executive Orders or the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). The C_{3}RT would inform potential cyber threat actors the consequences of carrying out cyberattacks against the U.S. To be effective, the U.S. should strictly abide by it in retaliating. The C_{3}RT should contain very strict punishments for cyber threat actors. It should factor the range of State activity in the Yannako-georgos and Healey's retaliation framework in setting the severity of the retaliation. The EU has adopted this method through its “Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox.”156\n2. Develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES). The ONCD should be the lead actor for this. The ONCD should work on updating the National Cyber Strategy, 2018 as per its enabling statute -- the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.157 The National Cyber Strategy should contain the enforcement strategy. The C_{2}ES should include steps to strengthen the existing relationship with the EU and other U.S. allies. The C_{2}ES may build on the D_{3} of the International Cyber Strategy, 2011.\n3. Introduce new retaliatory actions in the C_{3}RT beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment. This could include hack-back in case the cyberattack is by a State/State-sponsored.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper considers three of the most important questions in responding to cyberattacks. These are characterization, attribution, and retaliation. It found that the U.S. characterization process is not clear, nor is there an international framework for characterization. The paper however, found that the GOA Threat Table, 2021, characterizes the motivations by cyber threat actors in carrying out cyberattacks. This table is not so much different from the GAO's Threat Table, 2005. Yet, recent studies reveal that cyber threat actors constantly change their TTP and could conceal their true motivation, in order to prevent the U.S. from appropriately responding to a cyberattack. To address this problem, the paper thus, recommends three things: (1) the CTIC should conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks; (2) the CTIC should constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks; and (3) a JCG for cyberattacks should be developed. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a clear attribution procedure. There is also no single agency with the power to attribute, with virtually all the CTIC agencies having the power to attribute. Also, private sector companies participate freely in attribution. The paper discusses the dangers with these and makes three recommendations: (1) the CDRA should be amended before enactment to extend its scope to cover other cyber threat actors; (2) the attribution function should be designated a single agency -- the NCIA; and (3) the NCIA should develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline which will set forth the requirements\nand regulations for private sector companies that attribute cyberattacks. Unlike both characterization and attribution, there are several documents containing the U.S. retaliation policies. But these documents do not contain specific steps in retaliating. The policies lack preciseness. The paper thus, recommends (1) the development of a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks; (2) the ONCD should develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES) and (3) the C_{3}RT should introduce other retaliatory actions beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment.\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article."

Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response.\n© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n# 1. Introduction\nThe definition of the term \"cyberattack,\" though, contained in different scholarly works, $^{1}$  is often equated to a lesser form, called \"cybercrime,\" and a more intense form, called \"cyber\nwar.\" The most prominent definition of cyberattack describes it as an attack initiated from a computer against a website, computer system or critical infrastructure, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the attacked computer or information stored on it. The Department of Defense (DoD) adopted the following comprehensive\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105847\n0267-3649/© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The intended effects of cyberattacks are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyberattack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyberattack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.⁴\nWhen carried out, it aims to disrupt, disable, destroy, interfere, steal or control the data, information and functionality of the attacked computer or critical infrastructure.⁵ Generally, these attacks may be carried out by individuals, acting alone, or with others; terrorist organizations; non-state actors working for a State; or by State agencies⁶ – a prominent example of which was Russia's interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election using series of cyberattacks coordinated by State agencies.⁷\nCyberattacks have taken different spectrums over the years, and the U.S. defense agencies have identified them. These include Network Denial, Enterprise Denial, Enterprise Manipulation, Mission Denial, and Mission Manipulation.⁸ The methods of carrying out cyberattacks are numerous. A consideration of these methods is outside the scope of this paper. But they deserve mention:\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Phishing attacks\n- Drive-by-download attack\n- Password Attack\n- SQL Injection Attack\n- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\n- Eavesdropping attack\nThis paper focuses on cyberattack, as distinguished from cybercrime and cyberwar. One of the best efforts showing the distinction amongst the concepts of cyberattack, cybercrime and cyberwar is that of Hathaway et al. in the paper, The Law of Cyber-Attack. To the authors, a cyberattack is “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.”¹⁰ To this end, any attack that is “not carried out for a political or national security purpose, such as most instances of internet fraud, identity theft, and intellectual property piracy, does not fit this final element of a “cyberattack” and is therefore mere cyber-crime.”¹¹\nAlso, cyberattacks are distinguishable from cyberwar. To Hathaway et al., ‘cyber-warfare’ is... a term properly used only to refer to the small subset of cyber-attacks that do constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict.¹² From this distinction, a cyberattack may not constitute an armed attack under international law and thus, the retaliation to it is expected to fall short of an armed response.¹³ Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, attacks on any of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by the Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21)¹⁴ and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which though, do not have an effects equivalent to an “armed attack,” are classified as cyberattacks.¹⁵ This is because attacks on critical infrastructures pose a national security challenge as it may be injurious to both the people and the environment – for instance, the hacking of a critical infrastructure which releases toxic substance.¹⁶ According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the U.S. experienced an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks in 2021, with the critical infrastructures a major target.¹⁷\n⁴ DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, Memorandum for Chiefs of the Military Services, Commanders of the Combatant Commands and Directors of the Joint Staff Directorates (2011) https://info.publicintelligence.net/DoD-JointCyberTerms.pdf.\n⁵ Michael Power, Michael Pease, Keith Stouffer, CheeYee Tang, Timothy Zimmerman, Joseph Brule, et al.

Cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation, are related in some way. For instance, some scholars have classified characterization as part of the attribution process and to them, characterization is the attribution of cyberattacks to classes of adversaries. These three processes are necessary in responding to cyberattacks and developing a robust cyber defense system.\nThis paper is divided into six sections. After this introduction, Section 2 will focus on the U.S. characterization policies. Section 3 deals with attribution policies of cyberattacks against the U.S. Section 4 discusses the retaliation policies for cyberattacks against the U.S. The paper seeks to synthesize and answer the unanswered law and policy questions on characterization, attribution, and retaliation. To this end, the paper will critique the existing U.S. laws and policies on cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation. Section 5 will recommend laws and policies to address the identified gaps. Section 6 – the conclusion – will summarize the paper.\n# 2. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack characterization law and policy\nThe characterization process for cyberattacks by the U.S. intelligence and military agencies is not clear. There is equally no international standard for characterization. In simple terms, characterization means the interpretation given to the abnormality that occurs to the proper functioning of a computer system. Generally, the proper functioning of a computer system may be disrupted for different reasons, such as, human error, natural events or it may be deliberate (an attack). Where it is an attack, characterization is usually determined by the extent of the consequences of the attack. Characterization is important in the response process for two main reasons. First, it shapes how to respond to the cyberattack. For instance, where it is determined that the attack is malicious, characterization will help in the deployment of appropriate response. Secondly, characterization is important to strengthen the cyber defense.\nAn attack may be characterized in different ways: It may be for financial gains; for espionage; for service disruption; shaming; information gathering, among other. To characterize, the U.S. cyber threat intelligence community (CTIC) and private sector companies, as a preliminary step, usually identify the potential source of the attack in order to monitor and determine how to respond to such attack. This has proved difficult, as the U.S. has continued to research the blueprints of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors, (that is, highly motivated, sophisticated, and organized threat groups). For instance, between March and October 2021, the CTIC monitored Iranian government-sponsored APT actors. In March 2021, the FBI and CISA first observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors leverage Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet vulnerabilities to target a broad range of victims across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in furtherance of malicious activities. The monitoring continued till October 2021 before CISA finally publicly announced it in November 2021.\nAlso, the FANCY BEAR adversary associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special Services (Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate), was first identified as initially using extensively spear-phishing emails containing \"malicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure when conducting cyberattacks\"27 but thereafter reevaluated \"its operational tradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use of credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and victim-tailored phishing websites.\"28\nOver the years, the U.S. intelligence community and other cyber defenders have utilized different tools to identify the potential source of an attack in order to characterize it. These tools are used to understand the activities of the cyber threat actors which are useful for characterization purposes. These tools include intrusion detection systems (IDS), anomaly behavior detection tools, firewalls, IP addresses and forensic analysis of malware. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), CISA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a threat table characterizing each form of attacks by different threat actors (the Threat Table). The Threat Table, contained in the GAO's March 2021 High-Risk Series, characterizes the motivations by criminal groups, hackers and hacktivists, insiders, nations and terrorist in the following manner:\n18 Deborah Bodeau &amp; Richard Graubart, Characterizing Effects on the Cyber Adversary: A Vocabulary for Analysis and Assessment (2013) https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/characterizing-effects-cyber-adversary-13-4173.pdf.\n19 Cyberattacks as used in this paper include attacks targeted against U.S. critical infrastructure, companies and individuals.\n20 Kosmas Pipyros et al., A Cyber Attack Evaluation Methodology, in PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON CYBER WARFARE AND SECURITY (A.

Specifically, criminal groups use cyber exploits to commit identity theft, online fraud, and computer extortion. According to the 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment, criminal groups increasingly target U.S. critical infrastructure to generate profit, whether through ransomware, email impersonation fraud, social engineering, or malware.  |\n|  Hackers and hacktivists | Hackers break into networks for the challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain, among other reasons. By contrast, hacktivists are ideologically motivated actors who use cyber exploits to further political goals.  |\n|  Nation | Nations, including groups or programs sponsored or sanctioned by nation-states, use cyber tools as part of their information gathering and espionage activities.  |\n|  Terrorist | Terrorists seek to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit critical infrastructures in order to threaten national security, cause mass casualties, weaken the economy, and damage public morale and confidence.  |\n|  Source: GAO-21-288.31  |   |\nWhile generally, the Threat Table is an important tool in characterization, recent activities of cyber threat actors show that these actors do not necessarily conduct cyberattacks in accordance with the descriptions in the Threat Table. Thus, a strict adherence to the Threat Table may be outdated. For instance, according to the GAO and DHS's estimation in the Threat Table, terrorist groups \"do not currently have the sophisticated tools or skill necessary to execute a cyberattack that could cause a widespread outage or significantly damage the power system.\"32 If an attack significantly causes damage to the system, from this characterization, terrorists may be removed from the equation. But this potentially poses two dangers. First, it can limit the cyber response necessary for an attack. Secondly, it may lead to an embarrassing situation, \"if and when it is proven to have originated from more benign—if not necessarily less ominous (in terms of consequences)—causes.\"33 The Microsoft's Digital Defence Report, 2021, for instance, reveals the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) deployed by States like Russia and China,34 which make it dangerous to abide strictly by the Threat Table in the characterization process. Microsoft reported that in many instances, attackers did not conceal their actions, but concealed their intentions.35 It was found that hackers, who according to the Threat Table, are characterized as driven by \"challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain\" were in fact, carrying out\ninformation gathering characterized as States' motivation under the Threat Table.\nVery little has changed from the GAO's Threat Table since 2005. Yet, cyber threat actors have continued to expand their operations in old and new ways. Like criminal groups, Nation State actors, have \"moved toward targeting poorly configured or unpatched enterprise systems (VPN/VPS infrastructure, on-premises servers, third-party software) to perform living-off-the-land attacks.\"\n# 3. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack attribution law and policy\nAttributing an attack to a particular source is one of the major challenges in cyberattack response.40 But to the ODNI, though difficult, it is not impossible.41 Just like characterization, there is also no clear international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks.42 Yet, international law, while it allows the use of force for self-defense,43 demands that such force must be directed against the attacker.44 Thus, to lawfully use a countermeasure in response to a cyberattack, the victim State must first attribute the attack to the perpetrator precisely.45\n36 Id. 114.\n37 To access the GAO's Threat Table, 2005, see Cyber Threat Source Description, Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, <https: am=\"\" content=\"\" cyber-threat-source-descriptions#nat=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" usr=\"\">.\n38 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, Microsoft, 2022, <https: am=\"\" content=\"\" gory.prod.cms=\"\" gory.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com=\"\" m=\"\" m:=\"\" petsbuvv?culture=\"en-us&amp;country=us\" uu=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.\n39 Id. at 32.\n40 Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 17(2) J.

The attackers used the U.S. domestic infrastructure, which made it more difficult to trace the source of the attack.53 Thus, it has been suggested that in the attribu\ntion process, \"who is to blame?\" can be more important than \"who did it?\".54\nNotwithstanding the preceding, the ODNI believes that all cyber operation leaves a trail. Both the CTIC and private sector companies have developed tools to assist in making a precise attribution. Some of these include tradecraft, network traffic, computer log entries, malware collection, file timestamps, utilizing publicly available websites, blogs, and document repositories, among others. Though, the availability of these artifacts does not, itself, guarantee a conclusive proof of the source of an attack.\nThe cyber attributing body in the U.S. has transcended beyond the CTIC alone. Now, private companies, notably, CrowdStrike, FireEye, Mandiant, Microsoft, among others, partake in attribution. For instance, in its 2022 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike reportd and attributed the activities of COZY BEAR to Russia. It noted that during its investigation, COZY BEAR operators used \"authentication cookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks.\" Also, in its Digital Defense Report 2022, Microsoft made cyber attribution to States. Microsoft reported that it detected Russian network intrusion efforts against 128 organizations in 42 countries between February and June 2022 and that the U.S. was Russia's number one target.\nAs for the CTIC, the DHS notes that there is generally no single agency that has \"the authorities, capabilities, and expertise to deal unilaterally with a significant cyber incident.\" All the CTIC agencies work to complement the activities of each other. However, by the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive-United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD-41), the DoJ, acting through the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), is the Federal lead agency for cyber threat response activities.

Nonetheless, from a complete reading of the PPD-41, the ODNI, DHS, and other CTIC agencies could contribute to the attribution analysis.\nInterestingly, under U.S. law, the Secretary to the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD) could also make attribution. By Executive Orders 13694⁶⁹ and 13757⁷⁰ (E.Os. 13694 and 13757), the property of any person attributed by the Secretary to the USTD, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to have conducted a cyberattack which constitutes a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the U.S., are blocked from transfer, exported, or withdrawn. The USTD, through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for instance, exercised its power under E.Os. 13694 and 13757 by blocking Park Jin Hyok's assets in 2018 after being linked to WannaCry.⁷¹ But as noted below, the lack of a single attributing agency calls for a change.\nThere are different attribution models which have been developed to aid the attribution process. A popular one is the Herbert Lin's model.⁷² The model adopts three levels in the attribution process, namely, machines, human operators, and the ultimate responsible party. The first level requires forensic investigation of machines. Here, logfiles and IP address may be examined to locate the source of the attack.⁷³ The second level requires identifying the specific individual responsible for the attack. Here, to Lin, forensics alone is not sufficient.⁷⁴ Investigators need to accumulate a set of clues – such as historical records, private online forum, authentication – to pin the attack on a specific individual.⁷⁵ The last level requires identifying the entity an attacker works for: It could be for a terrorist group, government or alone. Here, one way to make this determination would be to interview the attacker.⁷⁶ There is proof of usage of this model by private cybersecurity firms.⁷⁷ On its part, in using the Lin's model, there are different ways the CTIC agencies could achieve this. First, the CTIC agencies could leverage on the efforts of the private sector companies.⁷⁸ Second, the CTIC agencies could utilize some surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which allows surveillance for national security or foreign intelligence investigations against a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.⁷⁹\nAccording to the ODNI, the CTIC's attribution process is modeled after some key indicators: Tradecraft, infrastructure, malware, and intent,⁸⁰ with tradecraft the most important indicator in the attribution process because \"habits are more difficult to change than technical tools.\"⁸¹ While the ODNI's Guide to Cyber Attribution does not contain a layer of steps in the attribution process, the Guide contains all the Lin's tools. Apart from the Lin's Model, in complying with its international law obligation regarding attribution, the U.S. can also use both data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations and documentary evidence.⁸²\nCyber attribution is important, because without it, there would not be deterrence for cyber attackers.⁸³ The U.S. attribution policies are modeled to achieve three goals, namely, public attribution; indictment; and sanction.⁸⁴ Public attribution involves publicly naming a threat actor as the attacker.⁸⁵ The principal aim of this approach is to publicly name and shame an attacker, especially States, with the view that the embarrassment from the naming and shaming, would deter the attacker from conducting another cyberattack.⁸⁶ CTIC, especially CISA through its alert system,⁸⁷ and private companies, have adopted this method. Sanctions and indictments have also been used by the U.S. government in concert with public attribution.⁸⁸\nIt is, however, generally agreed within the cyber community that the trio of public attribution, sanctions, and indictments, are not sufficient in achieving the attribution goal.⁸⁹ This is true, considering that from the various recent reports by the CTIC and private sector companies, cyber threat actors continue to conduct cyberattacks against the U.S., despite public attributions, sanctions, and indictments against cyber attackers. Further, another gap in the U.S. laws and policies for attribution is the lack of a definitive standard of proof required to make attribution.⁹⁰ Generally, it is extremely difficult in the attribution process to be almost certain about the source of a\n⁶⁸ Id.\n⁶⁹ Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Orders 13694 of April 1, 2015, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities.\n⁷⁰ Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/cyber2_eo.pdf.\n⁷¹ DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Press Release: Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks, U.S. (Sept. 6, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm473.\n⁷² Lin, supra note 57.\n⁷³ Id. at 81.\n⁷⁴ Id. at 84.\n⁷⁵ Id.\n⁷⁶ Id. at 86-7\n⁷⁷ Milton Mueller, Karl Grindal, Brenden Kuerbis &amp; Farzaneh Badiei, Cyber Attribution: Can a New Institution Achieve Transnational Credibility? 4(1) THE CYBER DEFENSE REV. 107, 108 (2019).\n⁷⁸ Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 49.\n⁷⁹ Lin, supra note 57, at 17.\n⁸⁰ A Guide to Cyber Attribution, supra note 41, at 3.\n⁸¹ Id.\n⁸² Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Muchael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31(3) EUR.

Yet, in order to effectively respond to a cyberattack – particularly under international law – attribution must first be made by the States.⁹¹\nThis attribution challenge is not exclusively a U.S. problem. This is a problem faced in all jurisdictions.⁹² More problematic is that international law does not provide a definite guide.⁹³ International law has been accused of failing to “set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution.”⁹⁴ Varying degrees of standards of proof have been laid by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for determining State responsibility under international law.⁹⁵ The ICJ at various times has required exceptional gravity, fully conclusive and clear and convincing standard of proofs.⁹⁶ Scholars believe that it is because of a lack of a single standard by the ICJ that the “Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be determined by the relevant forum.”⁹⁷\nAlthough scholars have clamored for a solution to the foregoing problem, “yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism.”⁹⁸ Notwithstanding, eminent international law scholars have attempted to provide an international law standard for attribution of cyberattack. For instance, where the cyberattack is less serious, Tsagourias and Farrell argue that “preponderance of the evidence” is the most appropriate standard.⁹⁹ They reasoned that both a very high standard, such as “beyond a reasonable doubt” and a low standard, may not ensure a balance.¹⁰⁰ But where the attack is a cyberwar,¹⁰¹ and the victim State intends\nto respond with the use of force, Finlay and Payne, suggest the use of “a strict test of attribution.”¹⁰² Importantly, international law does not – and cannot – require absolute certainty in attribution.¹⁰³ But it requires reasonability.¹⁰⁴ For this reason, convincing circumstantial proof standard, is said to be sufficient.¹⁰⁵ Most of the attribution made by the CTIC agencies and private sector, appears to adopt this standard, using the Lin’s model and the ODNI’s indicators.¹⁰⁶\nThere are many areas for improvement that appear from the U.S. cyberattack attribution policies and process described above. First, there is a lack of a single attributing agency. The danger with this is the potential disagreement in evidence gathering and attributing standards amongst the different CTIC agencies.¹⁰⁷ One Bill – the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018 (CDRA) – currently pending before the Congress, which aims to “address state-sponsored cyber activities against the United States, and for other purpose,”¹⁰⁸ rather than address the problem, compounds it by adding the President to the list of those who can attribute. By section 3(1), the President, acting through the Secretary of State, and in coordination with other relevant Federal agency heads, shall make attribution. The Bill does not designate a single Federal agency for attribution.\nSecond, there is no known procedure for making attribution. The CDRA also falls short of laying down any procedure. The danger here is that the absence of a known procedure affects the transparency, the due process of identifying the attacker and “could hamper the credibility of attribution more broadly.”¹⁰⁹ Such absence is also susceptible to the use of unjustifiable countermeasure and self-defense under international law. Under international law, while Article 51 of the UN Charter codifies the customary international law right of a State to use self-defense if faced with an armed attack,¹¹⁰ such State must do so within clearly established principles, otherwise, it will become the aggressor.¹¹¹\nThird, the lack of a standardized procedure coupled with the participation of the private sector in attribution freely, is a cause for concern. Private entities like CrowdStrike, FireEye, Mandiant, SecureWork and Microsoft, have all released reports attributing cyberattacks to different threat actors, including States/State-sponsored entities. The potential dangers here are: First, there could be potential contradiction – where the CTIC could reach a different conclusion as to the source of an attack, while the private sector entities reach another.¹¹² Second, there could be an interference with an on-\n⁹¹ Eichensehr, supra note 52, at 3.\n⁹² See for instance, Annegret Bendiek &amp; Matthias Schulze, Attribution: A Major Challenge for EU Cyber Sanctions: An Analysis of WannaCry, NotPetya, Cloud Hopper, Bundestag Hack and the Attack on the OPCW, SWP Research Paper 11 (2021).\n⁹³ For discussion, see Tsagourias &amp; Farrell, supra note 82, at 965 (stating that “current attribution claims do not rely on any particular standard of proof and that international law is quite ambiguous in this regard.”).

But there can be no effective deterrence without adequate attribution.¹¹⁶ Hence, the issues associated with attribution – difficulty, time and lack of a process – have invariably prevented achieving an effective retaliation.¹¹⁷\n## 4. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation law and policy\nA State that has faced a cyberattack has varying options – both under its domestic legal system and international law – in retaliating the attack. For instance, under international law, there are typically four options available to the victim State: Self-defense, countermeasures, the plea of necessity, and retorsion.¹¹⁸ But the threshold required before using any of these options is fuzzy.¹¹⁹ It is, however, clear that the self-defense option is only available when a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or “use of force.”¹²⁰\nThere are a lot of scholarships on the applicability of international law principles on use of force to a situation where a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or use of force.¹²¹ But as conceptualized in this paper, a cyberattack does not escalate to the level of an armed attack.¹²² “To date,” state Finlay and Payne, “few if any of the known cyberattacks appear to meet the threshold for a ‘use of force,’ let alone for an ‘armed attack.’”¹²³ In this situation – that is, where it is\na cyberattack and not a cyberwar – international law scholars are divided on the implications of this under international law.¹²⁴ Notwithstanding, the impacts of cyberattacks – even if it falls short of an armed attack or use of force – can be significant.¹²⁵ Therefore, cyberattack by its nature, violates the principles of non-intervention¹²⁶ and sovereignty under international law.¹²⁷ Hathaway, et al. provide a list of four other legal regimes that could regulate retaliation for cyberattacks, even if cyberattacks do not constitute an armed attack or use of force (cyberwar).¹²⁸ This paper critiques the fourth legal regime – the U.S. domestic law and policy.\nThe U.S. cyber retaliation policies are not contained in a single policy document. There are several documents stipulating the goal of cyber retaliation, but none contains specific retaliation steps nor a set of retaliatory actions. The U.S. has consistently maintained that its aim in retaliating is to pass a message to cyber attackers “that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.”¹²⁹ The U.S. cyber retaliation policies can be aggregated from its National Security Strategy, DoD Zero Trust Strategy, White House Statements, and the International Cyber Strategy. Some of the retaliation policies also appear in the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report. These are considered serially. First, the 2022 National Security Strategy states the aim of retaliation for cyberattack thus:\n“We aim to deter cyberattacks from state and non-state actors and will respond decisively with all appropriate tools of national power to hostile acts in cyberspace, including those that disrupt or degrade vital national functions or critical infrastructure. We will continue to promote adherence to the UN General Assembly-endorsed framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, which recognizes that international law applies online, just as it does offline.”¹³⁰\nIn the 2022 National Security Strategy, the U.S. states that it will adopt “Integrated Deterrence” in achieving its retaliation objectives.¹³¹ Integrated Deterrence recognizes that\n¹¹³ Id. at 479-80.\n¹¹⁴ Id. at 479.\n¹¹⁵ Id.\n¹¹⁶ See Clara Assumpção, The Problem of Cyber Attribution Between States 1 (2020) https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/83271 (stating that “attributing responsibility to who perpetrated an attack against a state and, even more importantly, who ordered it, is a way to achieve cyber deterrence”).\n¹¹⁷ Chris Jakaran, Cybersecurity: Deterrence Policy, (2022) Congressional Research Service 47011.\n¹¹⁸ Schmitt, supra note 45, at 244.\n¹¹⁹ Id.\n¹²⁰ Finlay &amp; Payne, supra note 93, at 202.\n¹²¹ See for instance, Michael N.

According to the Strategy, Integrated Deterrence entails five integrations. First, integration across domains, which recognizes that cyber threat actors operate across \"military (land, air, maritime, cyber, and space) and non-military (economic, technological, and information) domains—and that we must too.\"132 Second, integration across regions, which entails an understanding that cyber threat actors \"combine expansive ambitions with growing capabilities to threaten U.S. interests in key regions and in the homeland.\"133 Third, integration across the spectrum of conflict which aims \"to prevent cyber threat actors from altering the status quo in ways that harm U.S. vital interests while hovering below the threshold of armed conflict.\"134 The Strategy also entails integration across the U.S. Government; and integration with allies and partners.135 The Strategy states that Integrated Deterrence \"requires us to more effectively coordinate, network, and innovate so that any competitor thinking about pressing for advantage in one domain understands that we can respond in many others as well. This augments the traditional backstop of combat-credible conventional and strategic capabilities.\"136 The Strategy, however, does not contain specific retaliation steps nor set of retaliatory actions.\nSecond, some statements from the White House contain some of the retaliation policies. The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cybersecurity, for instance, aims to \"lock our digital doors\" and \"take aggressive action to strengthen and safeguard our nation's cybersecurity, including imposing costs on and strengthening our security against malicious actors.\"137 The Statement mentions the sanctioning of Russian cyber actors affiliated with the Russian intelligence services in response to the SolarWinds attack. It also mentions the imposition of cost against Iran for its counter-normative attack on Albanian government systems.138 Thus, the Statement mentions two retaliation options the U.S. resorts to as response to a cyberattack: Sanction and cost. But the Statement is not comprehensive, nor does it define when either of the retaliation options would be resorted to.\nThird, under the International Cyber Strategy, 2011, there are four steps preparatory to retaliation. They are (1) the U.S. will participate fully in international cybercrime policy development; (2) Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to the Budapest Convention; (3) Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the internet; and (4) Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the internet for operational planning, financing, or attacks.139 The Strategy develops three\nmodels: development, diplomacy and defense  $(\\mathrm{D}_3)$ . Where an attack occurs from a non-State threat actors, the retaliation includes investigation, apprehension, and prosecution.140 The Strategy further provides that when warranted, the U.S. will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace like any other threat. But before doing so, the U.S. would exhaust all other options, like weighing the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction. Where the U.S. resorts to the use of military force, it would categorize this as self-defense, and could compel actions under its military treaties with other countries.141 Where it gets to this, the U.S. could \"use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\"142 While the Strategy mentions the retaliatory actions, they are not clearly defined.\nFourth, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report, 2020 (CSC Report), also contains some of the U.S. retaliation policies and recommends some. The CSC Report establishes the \"layered cyber deterrence.\"143 Under this structure, the U.S. must shape the behavior in cyberspace; the U.S. must deny benefits to the cyber threat actors; and the U.S. must impose costs as retaliation for cyberattacks.144 The CSC Report also makes some recommendations with respect to retaliation. It recommends that the U.S. \"announce a second declaratory policy which would clearly state that the U.S. would respond using cyber and non-cyber capabilities to counter and impose costs\" against cyber threat actors \"below a use-of-force threshold.\"145 It also recommends that the U.S. government should \"publicly declare that it will defend forward, and couple its declaration with decisive and consistent action.\"146 According to the CSC Report, defend forward \"posits that to disrupt and defeat ongoing adversary campaigns, the United States must proactively observe, pursue, and counter adversaries' operations and impose costs short of armed conflict.\"147 The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cyber appears to be one of such public declaration. But as stated above, the Statement is not comprehensive.\nMuch of the criticisms on the U.S. cyber retaliation policies relate to its lack of preciseness. Preciseness is important for two reasons: First, it informs cyber threat actors of the actions that would be taken in retaliation for a cyberattack; and secondly, it encourages public debates among citizens to critique the retaliation actions sought to be taken against cyber threat actors.148 Another criticism is that the current retaliation options used by the U.S. are not sufficient, as they have not deterred cyberattacks.149 For this, some cyber experts have\n132 Id.\n133 Id.\n134 Id.\n135 Id.\n136 Id.\n137 THE WHITE HOUSE, Fact Sheet: Biden- Harris Administration Delivers on Strengthening America's Cybersecurity, October 11, 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-delivers-on-strengthening-americas-cybersecurity/.\n138 Id.\n139 International Strategy for Cyberspace, supra note 129, at 19-20.\n140 Id at 13.\n141 Id at 14.\n142 Id.\n143 Cyberspace Solarium Commission, Final Report, March 2020, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view\n144 Id. at 1.\n145 Id. at 34.\n146 Id.\n147 Id.\n148 Jakaran, supra note 117, at 10.\n149 Nathaniel Fick et al.

Yannakogeorgos, building on Healey's taxonomy, developed the below retaliation framework for State/State-sponsored attack:\n|  Range of state activity | Development | Diplomacy | Defense  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  State prohibited | X |  |   |\n|  State prohibited but inadequate | X |  |   |\n|  State ignored | X | X |   |\n|  State encouraged |  | X |   |\n|  State shaped |  | X |   |\n|  State coordinated |  | X |   |\n|  State ordered |  |  | X  |\n|  State-rogue conducted |  |  | X  |\n|  State executed |  |  | X  |\n|  State integrated |  |  | X  |\nSource: Yannakogeorgos (2016) 'Strategy for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,' p. 55.\nThe above retaliation framework while useful, are not adhered to by the U.S. government in retaliation. Although, there are times when part of this framework has been adopted, one of the other criticisms of the U.S. cyber retaliation laws and policies is that the U.S. government is inconsistent in its application. Despite the several documents stipulating the U.S. cyber retaliation options, none contains specific retaliation steps. And despite these several documents, the U.S. continues to experience an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks. Law and policy recommendations addressing this will, thus, improve the retaliation policies.\n# 5. Law and policy recommendations\nIn this part, some law and policy recommendations on the gaps and criticisms identified above will be made.\n1. Law and Policy Recommendation for Characterization:\nA. Conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks to understand the current motivations for each TTPs. The actors for this should be the USCYBERCOM, FBI, CISA and DHS + private sector. This would encourage information sharing amongst the CTIC and the private sector. It would also lead to a faster and easier characterization process. With it, the CTIC would be able to quickly characterize a malfunction in the computer system or critical infrastructure as a cyberattack with the detection of the TTPs.\nB. Constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks. The actors for this should be the GAO, CISA and DHS. These actors should also work with the private sector in this regard. For instance, CrowdStrike's Threat Activity Table in its 2022 Report, includes \"generating currency to support a regime\" as\npart of the motivations for a State attack. $^{151}$  This recommendation is important because it would reflect the dynamics and changing nature of the motivations for cyberattacks. It would also assist with the appropriate cyber response and defense.\nC. Develop a joint characterization guideline (JCG) for cyberattacks. The recommended actors for this are CISA, DoJ, FBI and DHS. In the guideline, a rigid characterization description should be avoided. The JCG should be revised annually (or as appropriate, for instance, where a cyberattack necessitates the need to change something substantial). The JCG should avoid definitive characterization of an attack before a full-scale investigation. This recommendation is necessary to have a standardized approach for characterization. It would make the characterization process tidier.\n2. Law and Policy Recommendation for Attribution:\nA. Amend the CDRA before enactment. The actor for this is the Congress. The scope of the CDRA should be extended to cover other threat actors. The extant CDRA Bill deals with \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" However, majority of the cyberattacks against the U.S. are conducted by non-State threat actors. The CDRA should create a body - The National Cyber Investigative Agency (NCIA) - and clothes it with the power to attribute to other cyber threat actors (other than State/State-sponsored actors) without the need for the President to make such attribution. The rationale for this law and policy is that the extant CDRA Bill covers only \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" It excludes cyberattacks by other cyber threat actors, who are equally a major threat. This recommendation would expand the scope of the CDRA to cover these other cyber threat actors. Also, under the CDRA, the President is empowered to make attribution for the \"State-sponsored cyber activities.\" This recommendation recognizes that given the number of cyberattacks against the U.S. annually, the functionality of attributing all cyberattacks (when the scope of the CDRA is expanded) by the President is not feasible. This recommendation posits that the NCIA should instead, be tasked with attribution of other cyber threat actors.\nB. Designate the attribution function to a single agency - The NCIA. This recommendation may be done by the Congress through legislation (the CDRA could create the NCIA) or President through Executive Orders. One agency that may be reconstituted to the NCIA as an independent agency is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force. All the CTIC agencies should\ncontinue providing supports in the attribution process as required by the NCIA. Only the NCIA should have the power to ultimately publicly attribute, though other CTIC agencies might publicize the attribution with the permission of NCIA. Also, the USTD should act on the attribution made by NCIA in blocking assets. In addition, the NCIA should be the advisory agency to the President in attributing cyberattacks to a State. The rationale for this recommendation is that in recent years, private sectors companies participate in the attributing of cyberattacks. As noted above in the Sony data beach and Olympic Destroyer attack, a lack of a coordinated attribution process may lead to contradictory attributions. This recommendation is aimed at addressing this. Also, this recommendation is apt to save cost and time in the attribution process. When a single agency (like the NCIA) is tasked with attribution, the cost and time expended by other CTIC agencies in attribution when aggregated will be reduced.\n2. Develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline (CAG). The NCIA should do this after its establishment. The CAG should stipulate the procedure for attribution. This would increase the transparency and credibility of the attribution process (due process). The CAG should also stipulate the requirements for private sector companies to make public attribution to States. It should require private sector companies to check with the NCIA before making public attributions to States/State-sponsored cyberattacks. The CAG may permit private sector companies to publicly make attribution with respect to other threat actors without consulting the NCIA. The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) should be under the NCIA. The rationale for this recommendation is that the JCDC was recently convened by the CISA to facilitate the relationship between the CTIC agencies and private sector companies in the attribution process.154 An effective collaboration between the public/private sectors requires a flexible terrain for the private sector.155 This recommendation posits that the CAG should be a document which clearly defines the assistance available to the private sector companies from the NCIA and other CTIC agencies in the attribution process.\n3. Law and Policy Recommendation on Retaliation\n1. Develop a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks. This may be done by the Congress through legislation; the President through Executive Orders or the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). The C_{3}RT would inform potential cyber threat actors the consequences of carrying out cyberattacks against the U.S. To be effective, the U.S. should strictly abide by it in retaliating. The C_{3}RT should contain very strict punishments for cyber threat actors. It should factor the range of State activity in the Yannako-georgos and Healey's retaliation framework in setting the severity of the retaliation. The EU has adopted this method through its “Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox.”156\n2. Develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES). The ONCD should be the lead actor for this. The ONCD should work on updating the National Cyber Strategy, 2018 as per its enabling statute -- the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.157 The National Cyber Strategy should contain the enforcement strategy. The C_{2}ES should include steps to strengthen the existing relationship with the EU and other U.S. allies. The C_{2}ES may build on the D_{3} of the International Cyber Strategy, 2011.\n3. Introduce new retaliatory actions in the C_{3}RT beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment. This could include hack-back in case the cyberattack is by a State/State-sponsored.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper considers three of the most important questions in responding to cyberattacks. These are characterization, attribution, and retaliation. It found that the U.S. characterization process is not clear, nor is there an international framework for characterization. The paper however, found that the GOA Threat Table, 2021, characterizes the motivations by cyber threat actors in carrying out cyberattacks. This table is not so much different from the GAO's Threat Table, 2005. Yet, recent studies reveal that cyber threat actors constantly change their TTP and could conceal their true motivation, in order to prevent the U.S. from appropriately responding to a cyberattack. To address this problem, the paper thus, recommends three things: (1) the CTIC should conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks; (2) the CTIC should constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks; and (3) a JCG for cyberattacks should be developed. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a clear attribution procedure. There is also no single agency with the power to attribute, with virtually all the CTIC agencies having the power to attribute. Also, private sector companies participate freely in attribution. The paper discusses the dangers with these and makes three recommendations: (1) the CDRA should be amended before enactment to extend its scope to cover other cyber threat actors; (2) the attribution function should be designated a single agency -- the NCIA; and (3) the NCIA should develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline which will set forth the requirements\nand regulations for private sector companies that attribute cyberattacks. Unlike both characterization and attribution, there are several documents containing the U.S. retaliation policies. But these documents do not contain specific steps in retaliating. The policies lack preciseness. The paper thus, recommends (1) the development of a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks; (2) the ONCD should develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES) and (3) the C_{3}RT should introduce other retaliatory actions beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment.\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article."

Jindal Global University, India # ARTICLE INFO Keywords: U.S.\nCyberattack Characterization Attribution Retaliation Law Policy # ABSTRACT This paper critiques the U.S. characterization, attribution, and retaliation laws and policies for cyberattacks. Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response.\n© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n# 1. Introduction The definition of the term\"cyberattack,\"though, contained in different scholarly works, is often equated to a lesser form, called\"cybercrime,\"and a more intense form, called\"cyber war.\"The most prominent definition of cyberattack describes it as an attack initiated from a computer against a website, computer system or critical infrastructure, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the attacked computer or information stored on it. The Department of Defense (DoD) adopted the following comprehensive https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105847 0267-3649/© 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847 definition shortly after the United States Cyber Command was created in 2010: A hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/ or destroy an adversary's critical cyber systems, assets, or functions. The intended effects of cyberattacks are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyberattack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyberattack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.⁴ When carried out, it aims to disrupt, disable, destroy, interfere, steal or control the data, information and functionality of the attacked computer or critical infrastructure.⁵ Generally, these attacks may be carried out by individuals, acting alone, or with others; terrorist organizations; non-state actors working for a State; or by State agencies⁶ – a prominent example of which was Russia's interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election using series of cyberattacks coordinated by State agencies.⁷ Cyberattacks have taken different spectrums over the years, and the U.S. defense agencies have identified them. These include Network Denial, Enterprise Denial, Enterprise Manipulation, Mission Denial, and Mission Manipulation.⁸ The methods of carrying out cyberattacks are numerous. A consideration of these methods is outside the scope of this paper. But they deserve mention: - Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial of-service (DDoS) attacks - Phishing attacks - Drive-by-download attack - Password Attack - SQL Injection Attack - Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack - Eavesdropping attack This paper focuses on cyberattack, as distinguished from cybercrime and cyberwar. One of the best efforts showing the distinction amongst the concepts of cyberattack, cybercrime and cyberwar is that of Hathaway et al. in the paper, The Law of Cyber-Attack. To the authors, a cyberattack is “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.”¹⁰ To this end, any attack that is “not carried out for a political or national security purpose, such as most instances of internet fraud, identity theft, and intellectual property piracy, does not fit this final element of a “cyberattack” and is therefore mere cyber-crime.”¹¹ Also, cyberattacks are distinguishable from cyberwar. To Hathaway et al., ‘cyber-warfare’ is... a term properly used only to refer to the small subset of cyber-attacks that do constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict.¹² From this distinction, a cyberattack may not constitute an armed attack under international law and thus, the retaliation to it is expected to fall short of an armed response.¹³ Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, attacks on any of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by the Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21)¹⁴ and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which though, do not have an effects equivalent to an “armed attack,” are classified as cyberattacks.¹⁵ This is because attacks on critical infrastructures pose a national security challenge as it may be injurious to both the people and the environment – for instance, the hacking of a critical infrastructure which releases toxic substance.¹⁶ According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the U.S. experienced an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks in 2021, with the critical infrastructures a major target.¹⁷ ⁴ DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, Memorandum for Chiefs of the Military Services, Commanders of the Combatant Commands and Directors of the Joint Staff Directorates (2011) https://info.publicintelligence.net/DoD-JointCyberTerms.pdf.\n⁵ Michael Power, Michael Pease, Keith Stouffer, CheeYee Tang, Timothy Zimmerman, Joseph Brule, et al.

Cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation, are related in some way. For instance, some scholars have classified characterization as part of the attribution process and to them, characterization is the attribution of cyberattacks to classes of adversaries.[18] These three processes are necessary in responding to cyberattacks and developing a robust cyber defense system.[19] This paper is divided into six sections. After this introduction, Section 2 will focus on the U.S. characterization policies. Section 3 deals with attribution policies of cyberattacks against the U.S. Section 4 discusses the retaliation policies for cyberattacks against the U.S. The paper seeks to synthesize and answer the unanswered law and policy questions on characterization, attribution, and retaliation. To this end, the paper will critique the existing U.S. laws and policies on cyberattack characterization, attribution, and retaliation. Section 5 will recommend laws and policies to address the identified gaps. Section 6 – the conclusion – will summarize the paper.\n# 2. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack characterization law and policy The characterization process for cyberattacks by the U.S. intelligence and military agencies is not clear. There is equally no international standard for characterization.[20] In simple terms, characterization means the interpretation given to the abnormality that occurs to the proper functioning of a computer system.[21] Generally, the proper functioning of a computer system may be disrupted for different reasons, such as, human error, natural events or it may be deliberate (an attack). Where it is an attack, characterization is usually determined by the extent of the consequences of the attack.[22] Characterization is important in the response process for two main reasons. First, it shapes how to respond to the cyberattack. For instance, where it is determined that the attack is malicious, characterization will help in the deployment of appropriate response. Secondly, characterization is important to strengthen the cyber defense.[23] An attack may be characterized in different ways: It may be for financial gains; for espionage; for service disruption; shaming; information gathering, among other. To characterize, the U.S. cyber threat intelligence community (CTIC)[24] and private sector companies, as a preliminary step, usually identify the potential source of the attack in order to monitor and determine how to respond to such attack. This has proved difficult, as the U.S. has continued to research the blueprints of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors, (that is, highly motivated, sophisticated, and organized threat groups).[25] For instance, between March and October 2021, the CTIC monitored Iranian government-sponsored APT actors. In March 2021, the FBI and CISA first observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors leverage Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet vulnerabilities to target a broad range of victims across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in furtherance of malicious activities. The monitoring continued till October 2021 before CISA finally publicly announced it in November 2021.[26] Also, the FANCY BEAR adversary associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special Services (Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate), was first identified as initially using extensively spear-phishing emails containing\"malicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure when conducting cyberattacks\"27 but thereafter reevaluated\"its operational tradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use of credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and victim-tailored phishing websites.\"28 Over the years, the U.S. intelligence community and other cyber defenders have utilized different tools to identify the potential source of an attack in order to characterize it. These tools are used to understand the activities of the cyber threat actors which are useful for characterization purposes. These tools include intrusion detection systems (IDS), anomaly behavior detection tools, firewalls, IP addresses and forensic analysis of malware.[29] The Government Accountability Office (GAO), CISA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a threat table characterizing each form of attacks by different threat actors (the Threat Table).[30] The Threat Table, contained in the GAO's March 2021 High-Risk Series, characterizes the motivations by criminal groups, hackers and hacktivists, insiders, nations and terrorist in the following manner:\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\n|  Threat actor | Description  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Criminal Group | Criminal groups seek to attack systems for monetary gain. Specifically, criminal groups use cyber exploits to commit identity theft, online fraud, and computer extortion. According to the 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment, criminal groups increasingly target U.S. critical infrastructure to generate profit, whether through ransomware, email impersonation fraud, social engineering, or malware.  |\n|  Hackers and hacktivists | Hackers break into networks for the challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain, among other reasons. By contrast, hacktivists are ideologically motivated actors who use cyber exploits to further political goals.  |\n|  Nation | Nations, including groups or programs sponsored or sanctioned by nation-states, use cyber tools as part of their information gathering and espionage activities.  |\n|  Terrorist | Terrorists seek to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit critical infrastructures in order to threaten national security, cause mass casualties, weaken the economy, and damage public morale and confidence.  |\n|  Source: GAO-21-288.31  |   |\nWhile generally, the Threat Table is an important tool in characterization, recent activities of cyber threat actors show that these actors do not necessarily conduct cyberattacks in accordance with the descriptions in the Threat Table. Thus, a strict adherence to the Threat Table may be outdated. For instance, according to the GAO and DHS's estimation in the Threat Table, terrorist groups \"do not currently have the sophisticated tools or skill necessary to execute a cyberattack that could cause a widespread outage or significantly damage the power system.\"32 If an attack significantly causes damage to the system, from this characterization, terrorists may be removed from the equation. But this potentially poses two dangers. First, it can limit the cyber response necessary for an attack. Secondly, it may lead to an embarrassing situation, \"if and when it is proven to have originated from more benign—if not necessarily less ominous (in terms of consequences)—causes.\"33 The Microsoft's Digital Defence Report, 2021, for instance, reveals the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) deployed by States like Russia and China,34 which make it dangerous to abide strictly by the Threat Table in the characterization process. Microsoft reported that in many instances, attackers did not conceal their actions, but concealed their intentions.35 It was found that hackers, who according to the Threat Table, are characterized as driven by \"challenge, revenge, stalking, or monetary gain\" were in fact, carrying out\ninformation gathering characterized as States' motivation under the Threat Table.[36]\nVery little has changed from the GAO's Threat Table since 2005.[37] Yet, cyber threat actors have continued to expand their operations in old and new ways.[38] Like criminal groups, Nation State actors, have \"moved toward targeting poorly configured or unpatched enterprise systems (VPN/VPS infrastructure, on-premises servers, third-party software) to perform living-off-the-land attacks.\"[39]\n# 3. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack attribution law and policy\nAttributing an attack to a particular source is one of the major challenges in cyberattack response.40 But to the ODNI, though difficult, it is not impossible.41 Just like characterization, there is also no clear international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks.42 Yet, international law, while it allows the use of force for self-defense,43 demands that such force must be directed against the attacker.44 Thus, to lawfully use a countermeasure in response to a cyberattack, the victim State must first attribute the attack to the perpetrator precisely.45\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847 But, attribution is said to have received\"comparatively little attention\"under international law.46 Scholars have expressed concern about the lack of an international guideline for attribution of cyberattacks which it is believed, gives States the abilities to [wrongfully] name and shame another country as the cyber attacker without a guiding principle on evidence gathering, sources, manner and extent.47 For instance, it is believed that the U.S. holds the view that the attribution process does not need to follow any strict legal standard and that its obligation under international law does not require it to disclose details (such as sources, manner of gathering etc.) about the evidence used to support its attribution of cyberattacks to cyber threat actors.48 Attribution involves the means by which the available evidence related to a cyberattack is organized, examined, and connected to a source.49 It is the identification of the cyber attacker.50 It generally involves a three-level analysis – the tactical (technical), the operational, and the strategic.51 But day by day, cyber attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their TTPs, making it more difficult to trace evidence to a particular source in order to attribute.52 For instance, in the SolarWinds cyber incidents, cyber attackers deployed malicious code to SolarWinds' Orion IT monitoring and management software used by government agencies across the world, including the U.S. government. The attackers used the U.S. domestic infrastructure, which made it more difficult to trace the source of the attack.53 Thus, it has been suggested that in the attribu tion process,\"who is to blame?\"can be more important than\"who did it?\".54 Notwithstanding the preceding, the ODNI believes that all cyber operation leaves a trail.[55] Both the CTIC and private sector companies have developed tools to assist in making a precise attribution. Some of these include tradecraft, network traffic, computer log entries, malware collection, file timestamps, utilizing publicly available websites, blogs, and document repositories, among others.[56] Though, the availability of these artifacts does not, itself, guarantee a conclusive proof of the source of an attack.[57] The cyber attributing body in the U.S. has transcended beyond the CTIC alone.[58] Now, private companies, notably, CrowdStrike,[59] FireEye,[60] Mandiant,[61] Microsoft,[62] among others, partake in attribution. For instance, in its 2022 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike reportd and attributed the activities of COZY BEAR to Russia. It noted that during its investigation, COZY BEAR operators used\"authentication cookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks.\"[63] Also, in its Digital Defense Report 2022, Microsoft made cyber attribution to States. Microsoft reported that it detected Russian network intrusion efforts against 128 organizations in 42 countries between February and June 2022 and that the U.S. was Russia's number one target.[64] As for the CTIC, the DHS notes that there is generally no single agency that has\"the authorities, capabilities, and expertise to deal unilaterally with a significant cyber incident.\"[65] All the CTIC agencies work to complement the activities of each other. However, by the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive-United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD-41),[66] the DoJ, acting through the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), is the Federal lead agency for cyber threat response activities.[67] Attribution is listed as one of the cy COMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847 ber threat response activities in PPD-41.⁶⁸ Thus, from this provision, the DoJ, FBI and NCIJTF need to work together to make an attribution. Nonetheless, from a complete reading of the PPD-41, the ODNI, DHS, and other CTIC agencies could contribute to the attribution analysis.\nInterestingly, under U.S. law, the Secretary to the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD) could also make attribution. By Executive Orders 13694⁶⁹ and 13757⁷⁰ (E.Os. 13694 and 13757), the property of any person attributed by the Secretary to the USTD, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to have conducted a cyberattack which constitutes a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the U.S., are blocked from transfer, exported, or withdrawn. The USTD, through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for instance, exercised its power under E.Os. 13694 and 13757 by blocking Park Jin Hyok's assets in 2018 after being linked to WannaCry.⁷¹ But as noted below, the lack of a single attributing agency calls for a change.\nThere are different attribution models which have been developed to aid the attribution process. A popular one is the Herbert Lin's model.⁷² The model adopts three levels in the attribution process, namely, machines, human operators, and the ultimate responsible party. The first level requires forensic investigation of machines. Here, logfiles and IP address may be examined to locate the source of the attack.⁷³ The second level requires identifying the specific individual responsible for the attack. Here, to Lin, forensics alone is not sufficient.⁷⁴ Investigators need to accumulate a set of clues – such as historical records, private online forum, authentication – to pin the attack on a specific individual.⁷⁵ The last level requires identifying the entity an attacker works for: It could be for a terrorist group, government or alone. Here, one way to make this determination would be to interview the attacker.⁷⁶ There is proof of usage of this model by private cybersecurity firms.⁷⁷ On its part, in using the Lin's model, there are different ways the CTIC agencies could achieve this. First, the CTIC agencies could leverage on the efforts of the private sector companies.⁷⁸ Second, the CTIC agencies could utilize some surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which allows surveillance for national security or foreign intelligence investigations against a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.⁷⁹ According to the ODNI, the CTIC's attribution process is modeled after some key indicators: Tradecraft, infrastructure, malware, and intent,⁸⁰ with tradecraft the most important indicator in the attribution process because\"habits are more difficult to change than technical tools.\"⁸¹ While the ODNI's Guide to Cyber Attribution does not contain a layer of steps in the attribution process, the Guide contains all the Lin's tools. Apart from the Lin's Model, in complying with its international law obligation regarding attribution, the U.S. can also use both data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations and documentary evidence.⁸² Cyber attribution is important, because without it, there would not be deterrence for cyber attackers.⁸³ The U.S. attribution policies are modeled to achieve three goals, namely, public attribution; indictment; and sanction.⁸⁴ Public attribution involves publicly naming a threat actor as the attacker.⁸⁵ The principal aim of this approach is to publicly name and shame an attacker, especially States, with the view that the embarrassment from the naming and shaming, would deter the attacker from conducting another cyberattack.⁸⁶ CTIC, especially CISA through its alert system,⁸⁷ and private companies, have adopted this method. Sanctions and indictments have also been used by the U.S. government in concert with public attribution.⁸⁸ It is, however, generally agreed within the cyber community that the trio of public attribution, sanctions, and indictments, are not sufficient in achieving the attribution goal.⁸⁹ This is true, considering that from the various recent reports by the CTIC and private sector companies, cyber threat actors continue to conduct cyberattacks against the U.S., despite public attributions, sanctions, and indictments against cyber attackers. Further, another gap in the U.S. laws and policies for attribution is the lack of a definitive standard of proof required to make attribution.⁹⁰ Generally, it is extremely difficult in the attribution process to be almost certain about the source of a ⁶⁸ Id.\n⁶⁹ Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Orders 13694 of April 1, 2015, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities.\n⁷⁰ Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/cyber2_eo.pdf.\n⁷¹ DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Press Release: Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks, U.S. (Sept. 6, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm473.\n⁷² Lin, supra note 57.\n⁷³ Id. at 81.\n⁷⁴ Id. at 84.\n⁷⁵ Id.\n⁷⁶ Id. at 86-7 ⁷⁷ Milton Mueller, Karl Grindal, Brenden Kuerbis &amp; Farzaneh Badiei, Cyber Attribution: Can a New Institution Achieve Transnational Credibility? 4(1) THE CYBER DEFENSE REV. 107, 108 (2019).\n⁷⁸ Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 49.\n⁷⁹ Lin, supra note 57, at 17.\n⁸⁰ A Guide to Cyber Attribution, supra note 41, at 3.\n⁸¹ Id.\n⁸² Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Muchael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31(3) EUR.

Yet, in order to effectively respond to a cyberattack – particularly under international law – attribution must first be made by the States.⁹¹ This attribution challenge is not exclusively a U.S. problem. This is a problem faced in all jurisdictions.⁹² More problematic is that international law does not provide a definite guide.⁹³ International law has been accused of failing to “set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution.”⁹⁴ Varying degrees of standards of proof have been laid by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for determining State responsibility under international law.⁹⁵ The ICJ at various times has required exceptional gravity, fully conclusive and clear and convincing standard of proofs.⁹⁶ Scholars believe that it is because of a lack of a single standard by the ICJ that the “Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be determined by the relevant forum.”⁹⁷ Although scholars have clamored for a solution to the foregoing problem, “yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism.”⁹⁸ Notwithstanding, eminent international law scholars have attempted to provide an international law standard for attribution of cyberattack. For instance, where the cyberattack is less serious, Tsagourias and Farrell argue that “preponderance of the evidence” is the most appropriate standard.⁹⁹ They reasoned that both a very high standard, such as “beyond a reasonable doubt” and a low standard, may not ensure a balance.¹⁰⁰ But where the attack is a cyberwar,¹⁰¹ and the victim State intends to respond with the use of force, Finlay and Payne, suggest the use of “a strict test of attribution.”¹⁰² Importantly, international law does not – and cannot – require absolute certainty in attribution.¹⁰³ But it requires reasonability.¹⁰⁴ For this reason, convincing circumstantial proof standard, is said to be sufficient.¹⁰⁵ Most of the attribution made by the CTIC agencies and private sector, appears to adopt this standard, using the Lin’s model and the ODNI’s indicators.¹⁰⁶ There are many areas for improvement that appear from the U.S. cyberattack attribution policies and process described above. First, there is a lack of a single attributing agency. The danger with this is the potential disagreement in evidence gathering and attributing standards amongst the different CTIC agencies.¹⁰⁷ One Bill – the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018 (CDRA) – currently pending before the Congress, which aims to “address state-sponsored cyber activities against the United States, and for other purpose,”¹⁰⁸ rather than address the problem, compounds it by adding the President to the list of those who can attribute. By section 3(1), the President, acting through the Secretary of State, and in coordination with other relevant Federal agency heads, shall make attribution. The Bill does not designate a single Federal agency for attribution.\nSecond, there is no known procedure for making attribution. The CDRA also falls short of laying down any procedure. The danger here is that the absence of a known procedure affects the transparency, the due process of identifying the attacker and “could hamper the credibility of attribution more broadly.”¹⁰⁹ Such absence is also susceptible to the use of unjustifiable countermeasure and self-defense under international law. Under international law, while Article 51 of the UN Charter codifies the customary international law right of a State to use self-defense if faced with an armed attack,¹¹⁰ such State must do so within clearly established principles, otherwise, it will become the aggressor.¹¹¹ Third, the lack of a standardized procedure coupled with the participation of the private sector in attribution freely, is a cause for concern. Private entities like CrowdStrike, FireEye, Mandiant, SecureWork and Microsoft, have all released reports attributing cyberattacks to different threat actors, including States/State-sponsored entities. The potential dangers here are: First, there could be potential contradiction – where the CTIC could reach a different conclusion as to the source of an attack, while the private sector entities reach another.¹¹² Second, there could be an interference with an on- ⁹¹ Eichensehr, supra note 52, at 3.\n⁹² See for instance, Annegret Bendiek &amp; Matthias Schulze, Attribution: A Major Challenge for EU Cyber Sanctions: An Analysis of WannaCry, NotPetya, Cloud Hopper, Bundestag Hack and the Attack on the OPCW, SWP Research Paper 11 (2021).\n⁹³ For discussion, see Tsagourias &amp; Farrell, supra note 82, at 965 (stating that “current attribution claims do not rely on any particular standard of proof and that international law is quite ambiguous in this regard.”).

But there can be no effective deterrence without adequate attribution.¹¹⁶ Hence, the issues associated with attribution – difficulty, time and lack of a process – have invariably prevented achieving an effective retaliation.¹¹⁷ ## 4. A critique of the U.S. cyberattack retaliation law and policy A State that has faced a cyberattack has varying options – both under its domestic legal system and international law – in retaliating the attack. For instance, under international law, there are typically four options available to the victim State: Self-defense, countermeasures, the plea of necessity, and retorsion.¹¹⁸ But the threshold required before using any of these options is fuzzy.¹¹⁹ It is, however, clear that the self-defense option is only available when a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or “use of force.”¹²⁰ There are a lot of scholarships on the applicability of international law principles on use of force to a situation where a cyberattack qualifies as an “armed attack” or use of force.¹²¹ But as conceptualized in this paper, a cyberattack does not escalate to the level of an armed attack.¹²² “To date,” state Finlay and Payne, “few if any of the known cyberattacks appear to meet the threshold for a ‘use of force,’ let alone for an ‘armed attack.’”¹²³ In this situation – that is, where it is a cyberattack and not a cyberwar – international law scholars are divided on the implications of this under international law.¹²⁴ Notwithstanding, the impacts of cyberattacks – even if it falls short of an armed attack or use of force – can be significant.¹²⁵ Therefore, cyberattack by its nature, violates the principles of non-intervention¹²⁶ and sovereignty under international law.¹²⁷ Hathaway, et al. provide a list of four other legal regimes that could regulate retaliation for cyberattacks, even if cyberattacks do not constitute an armed attack or use of force (cyberwar).¹²⁸ This paper critiques the fourth legal regime – the U.S. domestic law and policy.\nThe U.S. cyber retaliation policies are not contained in a single policy document. There are several documents stipulating the goal of cyber retaliation, but none contains specific retaliation steps nor a set of retaliatory actions. The U.S. has consistently maintained that its aim in retaliating is to pass a message to cyber attackers “that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.”¹²⁹ The U.S. cyber retaliation policies can be aggregated from its National Security Strategy, DoD Zero Trust Strategy, White House Statements, and the International Cyber Strategy. Some of the retaliation policies also appear in the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report. These are considered serially. First, the 2022 National Security Strategy states the aim of retaliation for cyberattack thus: “We aim to deter cyberattacks from state and non-state actors and will respond decisively with all appropriate tools of national power to hostile acts in cyberspace, including those that disrupt or degrade vital national functions or critical infrastructure. We will continue to promote adherence to the UN General Assembly-endorsed framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, which recognizes that international law applies online, just as it does offline.”¹³⁰ In the 2022 National Security Strategy, the U.S. states that it will adopt “Integrated Deterrence” in achieving its retaliation objectives.¹³¹ Integrated Deterrence recognizes that ¹¹³ Id. at 479-80.\n¹¹⁴ Id. at 479.\n¹¹⁵ Id.\n¹¹⁶ See Clara Assumpção, The Problem of Cyber Attribution Between States 1 (2020) https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/83271 (stating that “attributing responsibility to who perpetrated an attack against a state and, even more importantly, who ordered it, is a way to achieve cyber deterrence”).\n¹¹⁷ Chris Jakaran, Cybersecurity: Deterrence Policy, (2022) Congressional Research Service 47011.\n¹¹⁸ Schmitt, supra note 45, at 244.\n¹¹⁹ Id.\n¹²⁰ Finlay &amp; Payne, supra note 93, at 202.\n¹²¹ See for instance, Michael N.

According to the Strategy, Integrated Deterrence entails five integrations. First, integration across domains, which recognizes that cyber threat actors operate across\"military (land, air, maritime, cyber, and space) and non-military (economic, technological, and information) domains—and that we must too.\"132 Second, integration across regions, which entails an understanding that cyber threat actors\"combine expansive ambitions with growing capabilities to threaten U.S. interests in key regions and in the homeland.\"133 Third, integration across the spectrum of conflict which aims\"to prevent cyber threat actors from altering the status quo in ways that harm U.S. vital interests while hovering below the threshold of armed conflict.\"134 The Strategy also entails integration across the U.S. Government; and integration with allies and partners.135 The Strategy states that Integrated Deterrence\"requires us to more effectively coordinate, network, and innovate so that any competitor thinking about pressing for advantage in one domain understands that we can respond in many others as well. This augments the traditional backstop of combat-credible conventional and strategic capabilities.\"136 The Strategy, however, does not contain specific retaliation steps nor set of retaliatory actions.\nSecond, some statements from the White House contain some of the retaliation policies. The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cybersecurity, for instance, aims to\"lock our digital doors\"and\"take aggressive action to strengthen and safeguard our nation's cybersecurity, including imposing costs on and strengthening our security against malicious actors.\"137 The Statement mentions the sanctioning of Russian cyber actors affiliated with the Russian intelligence services in response to the SolarWinds attack. It also mentions the imposition of cost against Iran for its counter-normative attack on Albanian government systems.138 Thus, the Statement mentions two retaliation options the U.S. resorts to as response to a cyberattack: Sanction and cost. But the Statement is not comprehensive, nor does it define when either of the retaliation options would be resorted to.\nThird, under the International Cyber Strategy, 2011, there are four steps preparatory to retaliation. They are (1) the U.S. will participate fully in international cybercrime policy development; (2) Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to the Budapest Convention; (3) Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the internet; and (4) Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the internet for operational planning, financing, or attacks.139 The Strategy develops three models: development, diplomacy and defense $(\\mathrm{D}_3)$. Where an attack occurs from a non-State threat actors, the retaliation includes investigation, apprehension, and prosecution.140 The Strategy further provides that when warranted, the U.S. will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace like any other threat. But before doing so, the U.S. would exhaust all other options, like weighing the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction. Where the U.S. resorts to the use of military force, it would categorize this as self-defense, and could compel actions under its military treaties with other countries.141 Where it gets to this, the U.S. could\"use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\"142 While the Strategy mentions the retaliatory actions, they are not clearly defined.\nFourth, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report, 2020 (CSC Report), also contains some of the U.S. retaliation policies and recommends some. The CSC Report establishes the\"layered cyber deterrence.\"143 Under this structure, the U.S. must shape the behavior in cyberspace; the U.S. must deny benefits to the cyber threat actors; and the U.S. must impose costs as retaliation for cyberattacks.144 The CSC Report also makes some recommendations with respect to retaliation. It recommends that the U.S.\"announce a second declaratory policy which would clearly state that the U.S. would respond using cyber and non-cyber capabilities to counter and impose costs\"against cyber threat actors\"below a use-of-force threshold.\"145 It also recommends that the U.S. government should\"publicly declare that it will defend forward, and couple its declaration with decisive and consistent action.\"146 According to the CSC Report, defend forward\"posits that to disrupt and defeat ongoing adversary campaigns, the United States must proactively observe, pursue, and counter adversaries' operations and impose costs short of armed conflict.\"147 The White House Statement of 11 October 2022 on cyber appears to be one of such public declaration. But as stated above, the Statement is not comprehensive.\nMuch of the criticisms on the U.S. cyber retaliation policies relate to its lack of preciseness. Preciseness is important for two reasons: First, it informs cyber threat actors of the actions that would be taken in retaliation for a cyberattack; and secondly, it encourages public debates among citizens to critique the retaliation actions sought to be taken against cyber threat actors.148 Another criticism is that the current retaliation options used by the U.S. are not sufficient, as they have not deterred cyberattacks.149 For this, some cyber experts have\n\nCOMPUTER LAW &amp; SECURITY REVIEW 50 (2023) 105847\ndeveloped a cyber retaliation framework from the existing retaliation laws and policies, especially from the  $\\mathrm{D}_3$ . Yannakogeorgos, building on Healey's taxonomy, developed the below retaliation framework for State/State-sponsored attack:[150]\n|  Range of state activity | Development | Diplomacy | Defense  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  State prohibited | X |  |   |\n|  State prohibited but inadequate | X |  |   |\n|  State ignored | X | X |   |\n|  State encouraged |  | X |   |\n|  State shaped |  | X |   |\n|  State coordinated |  | X |   |\n|  State ordered |  |  | X  |\n|  State-rogue conducted |  |  | X  |\n|  State executed |  |  | X  |\n|  State integrated |  |  | X  |\nSource: Yannakogeorgos (2016) 'Strategy for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,' p. 55.\nThe above retaliation framework while useful, are not adhered to by the U.S. government in retaliation. Although, there are times when part of this framework has been adopted, one of the other criticisms of the U.S. cyber retaliation laws and policies is that the U.S. government is inconsistent in its application. Despite the several documents stipulating the U.S. cyber retaliation options, none contains specific retaliation steps. And despite these several documents, the U.S. continues to experience an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks. Law and policy recommendations addressing this will, thus, improve the retaliation policies.\n# 5. Law and policy recommendations\nIn this part, some law and policy recommendations on the gaps and criticisms identified above will be made.\n\nA. Conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks to understand the current motivations for each TTPs. The actors for this should be the USCYBERCOM, FBI, CISA and DHS + private sector. This would encourage information sharing amongst the CTIC and the private sector. It would also lead to a faster and easier characterization process. With it, the CTIC would be able to quickly characterize a malfunction in the computer system or critical infrastructure as a cyberattack with the detection of the TTPs.\nB. Constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks. The actors for this should be the GAO, CISA and DHS. These actors should also work with the private sector in this regard. For instance, CrowdStrike's Threat Activity Table in its 2022 Report, includes\"generating currency to support a regime\"as part of the motivations for a State attack. This recommendation is important because it would reflect the dynamics and changing nature of the motivations for cyberattacks. It would also assist with the appropriate cyber response and defense.\nC. Develop a joint characterization guideline (JCG) for cyberattacks. The recommended actors for this are CISA, DoJ, FBI and DHS. In the guideline, a rigid characterization description should be avoided. The JCG should be revised annually (or as appropriate, for instance, where a cyberattack necessitates the need to change something substantial). The JCG should avoid definitive characterization of an attack before a full-scale investigation. This recommendation is necessary to have a standardized approach for characterization. It would make the characterization process tidier.\n\nA. Amend the CDRA before enactment. The actor for this is the Congress. The scope of the CDRA should be extended to cover other threat actors. The extant CDRA Bill deals with\"State-sponsored cyber activities.\"However, majority of the cyberattacks against the U.S. are conducted by non-State threat actors.[152] The CDRA should create a body - The National Cyber Investigative Agency (NCIA) - and clothes it with the power to attribute to other cyber threat actors (other than State/State-sponsored actors) without the need for the President to make such attribution. The rationale for this law and policy is that the extant CDRA Bill covers only\"State-sponsored cyber activities.\"It excludes cyberattacks by other cyber threat actors, who are equally a major threat. This recommendation would expand the scope of the CDRA to cover these other cyber threat actors. Also, under the CDRA, the President is empowered to make attribution for the\"State-sponsored cyber activities.\"This recommendation recognizes that given the number of cyberattacks against the U.S. annually, the functionality of attributing all cyberattacks (when the scope of the CDRA is expanded) by the President is not feasible. This recommendation posits that the NCIA should instead, be tasked with attribution of other cyber threat actors.\nB. Designate the attribution function to a single agency - The NCIA. This recommendation may be done by the Congress through legislation (the CDRA could create the NCIA) or President through Executive Orders. One agency that may be reconstituted to the NCIA as an independent agency is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force.[153] All the CTIC agencies should continue providing supports in the attribution process as required by the NCIA. Only the NCIA should have the power to ultimately publicly attribute, though other CTIC agencies might publicize the attribution with the permission of NCIA. Also, the USTD should act on the attribution made by NCIA in blocking assets. In addition, the NCIA should be the advisory agency to the President in attributing cyberattacks to a State. The rationale for this recommendation is that in recent years, private sectors companies participate in the attributing of cyberattacks. As noted above in the Sony data beach and Olympic Destroyer attack, a lack of a coordinated attribution process may lead to contradictory attributions. This recommendation is aimed at addressing this. Also, this recommendation is apt to save cost and time in the attribution process. When a single agency (like the NCIA) is tasked with attribution, the cost and time expended by other CTIC agencies in attribution when aggregated will be reduced.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis paper considers three of the most important questions in responding to cyberattacks. These are characterization, attribution, and retaliation. It found that the U.S. characterization process is not clear, nor is there an international framework for characterization. The paper however, found that the GOA Threat Table, 2021, characterizes the motivations by cyber threat actors in carrying out cyberattacks. This table is not so much different from the GAO's Threat Table, 2005. Yet, recent studies reveal that cyber threat actors constantly change their TTP and could conceal their true motivation, in order to prevent the U.S. from appropriately responding to a cyberattack. To address this problem, the paper thus, recommends three things: (1) the CTIC should conduct research on the old and new TTPs used by cyber threat actors to carry out cyberattacks; (2) the CTIC should constantly update the Threat Table to reflect the changing motivations for cyberattacks; and (3) a JCG for cyberattacks should be developed. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a clear attribution procedure. There is also no single agency with the power to attribute, with virtually all the CTIC agencies having the power to attribute. Also, private sector companies participate freely in attribution. The paper discusses the dangers with these and makes three recommendations: (1) the CDRA should be amended before enactment to extend its scope to cover other cyber threat actors; (2) the attribution function should be designated a single agency -- the NCIA; and (3) the NCIA should develop a Cyber Attribution Guideline which will set forth the requirements\nand regulations for private sector companies that attribute cyberattacks. Unlike both characterization and attribution, there are several documents containing the U.S. retaliation policies. But these documents do not contain specific steps in retaliating. The policies lack preciseness. The paper thus, recommends (1) the development of a clear and comprehensive cyber retaliation toolbox (C_{3}RT) for each type of cyberattacks; (2) the ONCD should develop a clear cyber enforcement strategy (C_{2}ES) and (3) the C_{3}RT should introduce other retaliatory actions beyond public attribution, sanction and indictment.\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article."

    "abstract": "This paper critiques the U.S. characterization, attribution, and retaliation laws and policies for cyberattacks. Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response. © 2023 Mujib Jimoh. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
