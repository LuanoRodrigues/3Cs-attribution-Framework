As such, there are growing concerns that State sponsored cyber operations can harm the critical infrastructure and information systems of other States. In Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. However, to a large extent the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. However, an inquiry has not been undertaken to identify emerging African positions on international law and State sponsored cyber operations. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to inquire into emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations within the context of international law. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter will further consider challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n* Asst.

Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”.² Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations. Thus, cyberspace has extended the battlefield and is viewed as the fifth battle space alongside the more traditional domains such as land, air, sea and space.\nIn furtherance of the above view, some States and international military organizations have developed defence doctrines which recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. For example, in 1999, the United States Department of Defense Report on the Legal Issues of Information Operations observed that there is “an obvious military interest in being able to interfere with an adversary’s information systems, and in being able to protect one’s own”.³ In 2010, the United States Department of Defense recognized cyberspace as a\n1.

It defines “Military conflict in the information space” as “a form of interstate or intra-state conflicts with the use of information weapons”.⁹ The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept also defines “Information War” as:\nthe confrontation between two or more states in the information space with the purpose of inflicting damage to information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining the political, economic and social systems, a massive psychological manipulation of the population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force.¹⁰\n4 See C.

The form of war is accelerating to its evolution to informationalization”.¹²\nIn 2016, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) during its Warsaw Summit recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare.¹³ In this regard, the NATO Cyber Pledge which was adopted at the Summit pledges to ensure that Member States are “capable of defending themselves in cyberspace as in the air, on land and at sea”.¹⁴ Therefore, cyberattacks with demonstrated aggressive intentions can trigger the collective security mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.¹⁵\nWith the recognition of cyberspace as a domain of warfare, there have been growing concerns over the potential of State cyber operations to endanger international peace and security. This has prompted several calls to promote stability in cyberspace through the establishment of norms and legal regimes that promote responsible behaviour by States in cyberspace. Such calls led\n11 See B. Lilly and J. Cheravitch, ‘The Past, Present, and Future of Russia’s Cyber Strategy and Forces’, in T. Jančárková, et al., (eds.)

China’s Military Strategy further observed that: “Cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security. As international strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fiercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces. Being one of the major victims of hacker attacks, China is confronted with grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure. As cyberspace weighs more in military security, China will expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defense, support for the country’s endeavors in cyberspace and participation in international cyber cooperation, so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability”.\n13 See J.

The UNGGE addressed issues relating to cyber operations by States and recommended that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law which intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public.¹⁶ This recommendation is, however, not legally binding on States, but rather provides a framework of international best practices that States should consider with a view to promoting cyber stability.\nIn Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa, however, appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.

In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter further considers challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nThe chapter is divided into five sections. The first section is this introduction. The second section discusses the concept of State Sponsored Cyber Operations and Cyber Stability and also considers international law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations. It addresses the threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations in Africa. The third section identifies African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations by considering the provisions of African regional instruments such as the African Union Constitutive Act, African Union Declarations, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the African Union Non-Aggression Pact, the ECOWAS Protocol on Non-Aggression, and the SADC\n¹⁶ See UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174 (22 July 2015), 8 at paragraph 13(f).\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n241\nMutual Defence Protocol. In this regard, the provisions of the above regional instruments are examined with a view to applying them to State sponsored cyber operations. The fourth section identifies African national positions on State sponsored cyber operations by examining legal and policy instruments on cybersecurity and national security. The fifth section highlights challenges in identifying African national positions on State sponsored cyber operations and then the conclusion follows.\n## 2 State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nIn simple terms, State sponsored cyber operations refer to cyberattacks that are conducted by a State to disrupt or exploit the computer systems of a targeted State or cause harm to the computer systems and critical infrastructure of the targeted State with the objective of gaining an advantage over the targeted State. Such attacks may be conducted directly by a State through its institutions or through a non-State proxy with the support of a State. Targets of State sponsored cyber operations are usually critical infrastructure. However, all forms of computing devices connected to information networks are also potential targets of State sponsored cyber operations.\nState sponsored cyber operations can be executed through malicious cyber activities such as: the deployment of viruses, computer worms and malware that can disrupt and harm critical infrastructure; the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices; the use of hacking to steal critical data from institutions, governments and businesses; the use of ransomware to hold critical computer systems hostage; the use of cyber espionage to access national security information; and the use of online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within a country.\nA distinctive feature of State sponsored cyber operations is that they are generally cheaper than traditional military operations and can be carried out even by small States that may lack the technological capacities to carry out attacks. Such States can compensate for their disadvantage by hiring proxies. Therefore, at comparatively low risk and cost, significant damage and disruption can be inflicted on the intended target with little fear of reprisal given the challenges of attributing attacks to a particular individual or entity in cyberspace. Due to the challenge of attribution, State actors, criminal actors or non-State actors can loop through different computer systems in the process of perpetrating cyberattacks or even orchestrate attacks to appear to originate from government computers in another country. Thus, the problem of\nUCHENNA ORJI\nattribution creates uncertainty in identifying the origin of cyberattacks or the motive behind such attacks.¹⁷ As such, the nature of cyberspace gives disproportionate power to small and relatively insignificant malicious actors who can easily target foreign countries with a high degree of anonymity.¹⁸\nSeveral reported cyber incidents have been classified as State sponsored cyber operations. For example, in May, 2007, Estonia experienced a series of massive and coordinated cyberattacks which targeted the country's public and private critical information infrastructure.¹⁹ The attacks deployed botnets of one over million computers located in over 50 countries around the world²⁰ and the incident – classified as the world's first cyber war – is linked to Russia.²¹ In 2008, during the brief Russian-Georgia conflict, Georgia alleged that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against its government.²² Similar attacks were also launched against Georgia in 2019.²³ The 2010 Stuxnet attack which targeted and destroyed Iran's nuclear centrifuges was reported to be a joint cyber operation between the United States and Israel code-named Olympic Games.²⁴ In 2015, it was alleged that Russia had launched cyberattacks against Ukraine.²⁵\n¹⁷ See U.J.

Therefore, the concept of cyber stability is used to classify measures that aim to prevent or minimize conflict between actors, including States, in cyberspace. As such, the concept aims to minimize threats and conduct that can escalate tensions between States in cyberspace. However, despite the above definitions of cyber stability, the concept is to a large extent regarded as an emerging concept that has not yet been developed as an analytic category.33\nAttempts have also been made to define an African view of cyber stability that is distinguishable from the global view.34 In this regard, it has been argued that in many ways the global views of cyber stability in dominant literature do not apply to African States and that the dominant views of cyber stability which promote regulatory openness, interoperability and global integration have been argued as differing from the views of African countries, which consider that global integration can bring instability through dependence.35 This argument may hold to the extent that many African States promote the idea of national self-sufficiency and independence in the development of information communications infrastructure so as to prevent digital colonialism and dependence on technologically advanced countries.36 However, that argument does not hold in the context of promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, because African States have taken steps to establish\n32 See International Security Advisory Board, Report on a Framework for International Cyber Stability (United States Department of State, 2 July 2014) Appendix B.1, at p. 33.\n33 See L.

For example, African States have established regional treaties to promote cybersecurity governance such as the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection³⁷ and the ECOWAS Directive on Fighting Cybercrime,³⁸ which both require Member States to establish legal measures to criminalize and control cybercrimes and also establish frameworks for international cooperation on cybercrime.³⁹ In addition, some African States are parties to international treaties such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime⁴⁰ through which they participate in the Convention's extensive international cooperation framework and provide or receive mutual assistance from Western and non-Western countries that are parties to the Convention.⁴¹ These African developments tend towards regional and global integration in cybersecurity governance arrangements and challenge the argument that African States consider that global integration can bring instability through dependency.\nIn more practical terms, the concept of cyber stability aims to promote responsible State behaviour with a view to addressing the security challenges of the information society. This for example requires States to establish appropriate legal, policy and regulatory measures to protect cyber users and cyber infrastructure within their jurisdiction, and also ensure that cyber activities which are conducted within their jurisdiction do not cause harm to other individuals or infrastructure in another jurisdiction. The need to promote cyber stability arises from the increasing interconnectedness of national information communication networks in different countries. This has ushered in a new age of network interdependence where the security of each country's network is\n37 See African Union (AU) Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, EX.CL/846(XXV) adopted at the 23rd Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union (Malabo, 27 June 2014).\n38 See ECOWAS Directive C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime, adopted at the Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers at Abuja, Nigeria (August 2011).\n39 See U.J.

Thus, in this state of network interdependence, malicious cyber activities can have trans-boundary effects. Hence, malicious cyber activities which are conducted in a particular State can harm individuals or infrastructure located in another State. This also has potential to affect relations between States in a manner that can endanger international peace and security. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability requires States to maintain governance responsibility over cyber activities on their territory and refrain from cyber activities that can cause harm to persons or infrastructure in other States.\nThe concept of cyber stability enshrines elements of the international principles of trans-boundary harm and State responsibility. These principles were recognized in different contexts in the Corfu Channel Case, where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that a State may not \"allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\",[42] and in the Trail Smelter Case, where it was held that \"no State has right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein\".[43] These principles also exist in international telecommunications law. For example, Article 38.5 of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) requires Member States not to cause harm to the operation of telecommunications in other States. Thus, it declares that \"Member States recognize the necessity of taking practical measures to prevent the operation of electrical apparatus and installations of all kinds from disrupting the operation of telecommunication installations within the jurisdiction of other Member States\".[44]\n## 2.2 International Law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nCalls for norms and legal regimes to govern the conduct of States with respect to cyber activities that can endanger international peace and security $^{45}$ have sought to promote cyber stability by proposing the establishment of rules to ensure responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. $^{46}$ Such calls have led to\n42 See The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v.

In this regard, issues concerning international cyber stability were first placed on the agenda of the UN by the Russian Federation in 1998 when it proposed UN General Assembly Resolution 53/70 on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was adopted without vote on 4 December, 1998⁴⁷ following a recommendation of the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security.⁴⁸ Since then, that Resolution has been repeated annually.⁴⁹ In particular, the Resolution noted the need to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, and expressed concerns that information technologies “can potentially be used for purposes that are consistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States”.⁵⁰ Subsequently, between 2004 and 2017, the United Nations convened the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs [information and communication technologies] by States” and also propose measures to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence building measures.⁵¹\nIn particular, the third UN GGE⁵² made several landmark conclusions, including that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity\n47 See UN General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n48 See UN General Assembly, Role of Science and Technology in the Context of Security, Disarmament and Other related Fields, Report of the First Committee, A/53/576 (18 November, 1998).\n49 See UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, <https: disarmament=\"\" informationsecurity=\"\" topics=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></https:>, visited on 15 February 2022.

The African Union (AU) is the most prominent regional intergovernmental organization that unites African States and it comprises 55 sovereign States.⁶³ Other notable intergovernmental organizations that operate within Africa's sub-regions include: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)⁶⁴ which comprises 19 Member States, the Economic Community of West African West States (ECOWAS)⁶⁵ which comprises 15 Member States, the Southern African Development Community (SADC)⁶⁶ which comprises 16 Member States and the East African Community (EAC) which comprises six States.\nThe increasing penetration of ICTs in Africa⁶⁷ has been followed with their growing integration in critical national sectors.⁶⁸ For example, banking and financial services sectors in African States are increasingly integrating ICTs to enhance service delivery and improve consumer satisfaction.⁶⁹ Also, across\n⁶⁰ See E.

For example, in January, 2018, China denied that the computer network equipment it had supplied to the AU allowed it to access confidential information from the AU.73 In June 2020, following a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam being built on the Nile River, it was reported that Egyptian hackers had launched cyberattacks on a number of Ethiopian websites.74 In December, 2020, it was reported that Chinese hackers had been accessing the security footage from cameras installed at the AU headquarters.

For example, in 2011, the ECOWAS adopted a Directive to fight cybercrime within the ECOWAS region.76 Also in 2011, COMESA developed a Model Cybercrime Bill with a view to providing a uniform framework that would serve as a guide for the development of cybercrime laws in Member States.77 In 2012, the SADC adopted a Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime to serve as a guide for the development of cybersecurity laws in SADC Member States.78 In 2014, the AU adopted the Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection to harmonize the laws of African States on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control.79 To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa has been on curbing cybercrime and it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace by African States. However, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n## 3 Identifying African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrican regional organizations have legal instruments on cybersecurity such as the ECOWAS Directive on Cybercrime, the COMESA Model Cybercrime Bill, the SADC Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime, the AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Cybersecurity Strategy. However, these instruments only focus on cybersecurity governance and cybercrime control and have not explicitly addressed State sponsored\n75 Ibid.\n76 See ECOWAS Directive C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime, adopted at the Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers at Abuja, Nigeria (August 2011).\n77 See Official Gazette of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Vol. 16 No. 2 (15 October 2011).\n78 See SADC Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime Version 2.0 Adopted on 2 March 2012.\n79 See African Union (AU) Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, EX.

Nevertheless, there are African regional instruments and declarations that could indicate emerging positions on State sponsored cyber operations. Such instruments and declarations exist within the framework of African regional organizations such as the AU, the ECOWAS, and the SADC and will now be discussed.\n## 3.1 The Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU)\nThe Constitutive Act sets down the Objectives of the Union, which include inter alia to: \"promote peace, security, and stability on the continent\". In furtherance of its objectives, the AU establishes a range of governing principles which include: the establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent; a prohibition of the use of force or threat to use force among Member States of the Union; non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another; the right of Member States to live and coexist in peace and security; and rejection of acts of impunity, acts of terrorism and subversive activities. These principles in the AU Constitutive Act do not expressly mention cyber stability; however, they can be broadly interpreted as accommodating recent developments that affect cyber stability. For example, acts that affect the peace, security and stability of African States in contemporary times include State sponsored cyber operations that target critical national infrastructure and data. As such, the above principles of the AU Constitutive Act impose broad positive obligations on Member States to refrain from engaging in acts that will affect the peace, security and stability of Africa regardless of whether such acts were conducted offline or through cyberspace.\nIt is also possible for the AU principle on the prohibition of non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another Member State could be violated by State sponsored cyber operations that seek to use hacking operations or online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within an African State. This would apply to instances where a Member State uses hacking operations to influence the election outcome in another Member State or where a Member State uses online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption within another Member State with the objective of achieving a negative state of affairs in the targeted State. In addition, the AU principle on the prohibition of subversive activities would broadly apply to acts of subversion carried out through the cyberspace by a Member State against another Member State. For example, cyberspace can be used to spread disinformation or hate speech with the aim of creating dissension and destabilizing a Member State. Therefore, the principle of prohibition of subversive activities establishes broad positive obligations that would require a Member State to prevent its\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nterritory and resources from being used to encourage or commit acts of subversion against another Member State through cyberspace.\n## 3.2 The AU Non-aggression and Common Defence Pact⁸⁰\nThe AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact was adopted in 2005 and seeks “to put an end to conflicts of any kind within and among States in Africa in order to create conditions for socio-economic development and integration of the continent as well as the fulfilment of the aspirations of [African] peoples”.⁸¹ The Pact entered into force on 18 December 2009 after its ratification by 15 AU Member States. As of August, 2021, 44 AU Member States had signed the Pact, while 22 Member States had ratified it.⁸² To a large extent, the Pact is regarded as containing by far “the most elaborate political commitment of African States not to commit aggression against each other”.⁸³\nThe Pact elaborately defines ‘aggression’ as “the use, intentionally, and knowingly, of armed force or any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity, against the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and human security of the population of a State party to this Pact, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations or the Constitutive Act of the African Union ...”.⁸⁴ Some elements of the above definition of aggression appear to create broad scope for classifying hostile cyber operations conducted by a Member State against another Member State within the meaning of aggression. For example, the Pact does not restrict the definition of aggression to the use of ‘armed force’, but includes ‘any other hostile act’ conducted by a State or non-State actor against the ‘sovereignty’ and ‘human security’ of the population of a Member State. In modern times, hostile acts against the sovereignty of a State would include disruption of its critical information infrastructure,\n⁸⁰ See U.J. Orji, ‘Rethinking the African Union Non-Aggression Treaty as a Framework for Promoting Responsible in Cyberspace’, Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public &amp; International Law (MPII) Research Paper Series, No. 2021–24, (September, 2021), pp.7–20, <https: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"3930007\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n⁸¹ See Preamble to the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact (2005).\n⁸² See The Status List: AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact, (January, 2020) <https: africa-union-non-aggression-and-common-defence-pact=\"\" en=\"\" au.int=\"\" treaties=\"\" treaties@africa-union-non-aggression-and-common-defence-pact=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n⁸³ See Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression, Preventing Aggression in the African Context, <https: 8=\"\" documents=\"\" crimeofaggression.info=\"\" bots_aggression_in_africa.pdf=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n⁸⁴ Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact (Emphasis added).</https:></https:></https:>\nUCHENNA ORJI\ngiven the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.⁸⁵ As such, under the Pact, there is scope for classifying a Member State's cyber operations that disrupts another Member State's critical information infrastructure as a hostile act that fits into the definition of aggression under the Pact.\nThe Pact's broad definition of aggression as including “... any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity ...”⁸⁶ also provides a basis for considering application of the Pact as an African framework for regulating State cyber operations. This is because hostile acts that violate the sovereignty of a State would include attacks that target its critical information infrastructure, given the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.\nIn addition, specific acts that constitute ‘acts of aggression’ (regardless of a declaration of war) under the Pact include: the use of any weapon against the territory of a Member State; the blockade of the ports, coasts or airspace of a Member State; the action of a Member State in allowing its territory to be used by another Member State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; and technological assistance of any kind, intelligence and training to another State for use in committing acts of aggression against another Member State.⁸⁷ Thus, the above elements that exist within the definition of aggression provide broad scope for considering the Pact as a framework that applies to State cyber operations. For example, ‘any weapon’ within the context of the Pact would technically include a cyber-weapon such as malware, given that such a weapon can be used to execute an attack against critical information infrastructure located in the territory of a Member State. Also, cyberattacks can be used to conduct a blockade of Member State ports, coasts or airspace,⁸⁸ while the use of a cyber-weapon to immobilize the armed forces or marine fleets of a Member State would technically fit within the Pact’s definition of aggression. This also applies where a Member State engages in acts of cyber espionage which could be used for military aggression against another Member State or provides another Member State with technological assistance of any kind such as cyber capability to conduct aggression against another Member State. In addition, a Member State that allows its territory to be used by another Member State to conduct cyberattacks against another Member State or provides support\n⁸⁵ Art. 1 AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.\n⁸⁶ See Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact [emphasis added].\n⁸⁷ Ibid.\n⁸⁸ See C.

The Council functions as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and efficient response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa.89 The Peace and Security Council, which is responsible for implementing the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact,90 is required to periodically update the Pact so as to enhance its implementation in light of contemporary security challenges.91 While the Council has not carried out any update to reflect cyber-security challenges such as State sponsored cyber operations, recent developments appear to indicate that the Council is developing a position on State sponsored cyber operations. In May, 2019, the Council issued a Communiqué on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa. The Communiqué recognized \"the increasing vulnerability of the entire Continent to the growing threat of cyber-crimes/cyberattacks\".92 In particular, the Council expressed concerns that \"a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely\" and that \"increasing global threats to Cyber Security ... constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security\".93 In furtherance of these concerns, the Council requested the AU Commission to work in collaboration with the AU Department for Peace and Security, Member States and the Regional Economic Communities to expeditiously develop a Continental Cyber Security Strategy and to report back to\n89 See Art. 2, Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, Adopted by the 1st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union, Durban, 9 July 2002.\n90 See Art. 9 AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact.\n91 See Art. 21, ibid.\n92 See African Union, Communiqué Adopted by the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU) at its 850th meeting held on 20 May 2019 on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa.

Principle 38 of the Declaration prohibits Member States from interfering with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. In this regard, Principle 38 (1) of the Declaration states that:\nStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\nMore importantly, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration provides that:\nStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n⁹⁴ Ibid, at paragraph 13.\n⁹⁵ See Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. Adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights at its 65th Ordinary Session held from 21 October to 10 November 2019 in Banjul, the Gambia, <https: 2019.pdf=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 96=\"\" a=\"\" account=\"\" africa.=\"\" africa.=\"\" and=\"\" at=\"\" be=\"\" by=\"\" cf000000=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" d=\"\" d:=\"\" eachpr.org=\"\" file=\"\" fles=\"\" fles-englis=\"\" for=\"\" free=\"\" freeform=\"\" gambia,=\"\" in=\"\" jbid,=\"\" krtps:=\"\" knowerper09=\"\" of=\"\" on=\"\" on%20freedom%20of%20expression_eng_2019.pdf=\"\" public=\"\" public/document=\"\" public?document=\"\" rpch=\"\" se=\"\" see=\"\" state=\"\" states=\"\" the=\"\" visual=\"\" www.achpr.org=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n257\nThus, while no provisions of the Declaration specifically address State sponsored cyber operations, the above provision of Principle 38 (2) can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt access to the Internet and critical information infrastructure in another Member State. This is because the positive obligation that is established in Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration is not specifically restricted to disruption of access to the Internet or other digital technologies within a Member State's territory. Rather, the obligation relates to \"any disruption of access\" to the Internet and other digital technologies provided that it has hindered exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. Therefore, in fulfilling the positive obligation under Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration, a Member State is required to refrain from conducting cyber operations against another Member State where such operation will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure (for example, critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education).\nIn addition, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration imposes a positive obligation on Member States not to \"condone any disruption\" of Internet access or other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population. Thus, in fulfilling the above positive obligation a Member State is not only required to refrain from conducting cyber operations that will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, but the obligation further requires a Member State to condemn and refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors that conduct cyber operations to disrupt Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, including critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education.\n## 3.5 The ECOWAS\nThe founding Treaty of the ECOWAS establishes its objectives, which include: promoting regional cooperation and integration and maintaining peace, stability and security within the region.97 In pursuance of the objectives to maintain peace, stability and security within the region, the ECOWAS adopted a Protocol on Non-Aggression in 1978, which imposes obligations on Member States to refrain from using \"force or aggression\" and \"any other means inconsistent with\" the Charter of the United Nations or Constitutive Act of the AU against the territorial integrity and political independence of\n97 See Art. 58 ECOWAS Treaty.\nUCHENNA ORJI\nother Member States.⁹⁸ The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations. However, its provisions can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 2 of the Protocol requires every Member State to “refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States”.⁹⁹ The Protocol does not define the meaning of terms such as ‘subversion’, ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’, hence resort shall be had to other definitions of those terms. ‘Subversion’ simply refers to undermining the power and authority of an established system or institution or State.¹⁰⁰ ‘Hostility’ refers to hostile or unfriendly behaviour such as acts of warfare.¹⁰¹ Similarly, ‘aggression’ refers to hostile behaviour such as the act of attacking a State.¹⁰² Thus, a broad interpretation of acts of ‘subversion’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will include State sponsored cyber operations that seek to undermine the power and authority of a Member State. This, for example, will include State sponsored online disinformation campaigns that are targeted to cause disruption and chaos within another Member State. A broad interpretation of acts of ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will also include State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure located within the territory of a Member State. In addition, fulfilment of the obligation under Article 2 of the Protocol will require Member States to condemn cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure in another Member State and also to refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors in the conduct of such operations.\nArticle 3 of the Protocol further imposes obligations on Member States to prevent foreigners resident within their territories from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other Member States.¹⁰³ A broad interpretation of this obligation in the context of cyber operations implies, for example, that Member States are required to hold foreigners resident within their territories accountable where they engage in or encourage cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State. In addition, the Protocol requires every Member State to prevent “non-resident foreigners”\n98 See Art. 1 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol (1978).\n99 See Art. 2 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol.\n100 See The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (8th Edition, 2015), p. 1491.\n101 Ibid, p. 727.\n102 Ibid, p. 28.\n103 See Art. 3 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol.\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n259\nfrom using its territory as a base for conducting or encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States. Application of this obligation in the context of cyber operations would require a Member State to refrain from providing its territory as a base to “non-resident foreigners” for the purpose of conducting cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State.\n## 3.6 The SADC\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the SADC is to safeguard peace, stability and security within the SADC region. In pursuance of this objective, the SADC adopted a Mutual Defence Protocol in August, 2003. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations; however, Article 8 of the Protocol can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 8 of the Protocol provides that: “State parties undertake not to nurture, harbour or support any person, group of persons or institutions whose aim is to destabilize the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party”. Article 2 of the Protocol defines the term destabilize as:\nto instigate, plan, execute or assist in any of the following:\n(a) an armed attack against a State party;\n(b) sabotage aimed at the people of a State Party or an asset of a State party, whether inside or outside the territory of the State party; or,\n(c) any act or activity aimed at changing the constitutional order of a State Party through unconstitutional mean.¹⁰⁴\nIn light of the above definition of destabilization, a broad interpretation of Article 8 of the Protocol would require, for example, that a State Party is to refrain from nurturing, harbouring, instigating or supporting any person, group of persons or institutions that seek to carry out cyber operations with the aim of disrupting or sabotaging national critical information infrastructure with a view to destabilizing the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party. The SADC has also recognized a connection between cybersecurity and regional instability. For example, in 2004, the SADC Strategic Plan on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation recognized the need to build capacity to combat cybercrime and terrorism in\n¹⁰⁴ See Art. 2 SADC Mutual Defense Protocol (2003).\nUCHENNA ORJI\norder to protect the region against instability arising from intrastate conflicts and aggression.¹⁰⁵\n## 4 Identifying National Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nOnly a few African countries have considered issues relating to cyber conflict in their laws and policies on national security and cybersecurity. In most cases, such issues have been highlighted briefly in laws and policy instruments without providing clear definitions or national doctrines. For example, in Ghana, the Cybersecurity Act provides for the establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority which will be responsible “for taking measures in response to cybersecurity incidents that occur within and outside the country which may threaten national security; the defence of the country; the economy of the country; [and] international relations between the State and other countries”. However, aside from this provision, Ghana has not established a clear national doctrine that addresses cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Malawi, the National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes the development of a cybersecurity contingency plan that will include the role of the military during cyberattacks and emergencies.¹⁰⁶ The Strategy also proposes the development of a Cyber Defence Strategy that establishes approaches to addressing national security threats in cyberspace.¹⁰⁷ The Strategy further grants the military a prominent role in the management of cybersecurity incidents. In this regard, the Strategy provides that the Malawi Defence Force in collaboration with the Malawi Computer Emergency Response Team “will continuously monitor the cyberspace sphere to identify and address cyber threats and risks to the National Security of Malawi”.¹⁰⁸ However, aside from the above declarations in Malawi’s National Cybersecurity Strategy, the country is yet to develop a clear national doctrine that addresses State sponsored cyber operations or acts of aggression in cyberspace. Similarly, in Kenya, the government prescribes a broad role for the Ministry of Defence in cybersecurity governance.\n¹⁰⁵ See SADC Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (2004), p. 38.\n¹⁰⁶ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy (2019–2024), p. 16, <https: 160=\"\" api.pppc.mw=\"\" national-cybers-col.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy, p. 29.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn this regard, the Kenyan Ministry of Defence White Paper declares that \"cyber-attacks can undermine State security. [The] Ministry of Defence in collaboration with other stakeholders must develop appropriate capacity and institute measures to safeguard information systems\".[109] However, beyond this declaration, Kenya is yet to develop the role of the military in the management of cybersecurity threats, and the country is yet to develop a policy on cyber defence or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Morocco, the military plays a prominent role in cybersecurity governance. In this regard, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has the responsibility of overseeing the development of cybersecurity and cyber defence capabilities and for ensuring the resilience and availability of the country's military operational networks.[110] Morocco has also developed several cyber-related capabilities; however, despite the military's role in the management of cybersecurity threats, the country is yet to develop a formalized military policy or electronic on cybersecurity.[111]\nSouth Africa appears to be the only African country that has recognized cyber warfare concerns in its national defence policy. In this regard, South Africa's Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 recognizes that \"information warfare\" including the targeting of political institutions and processes, is a national concern.[112] In a military context, the policy classifies South African cyberspace as a \"domain\" under \"the physical control and political authority of the South African State\".[113] The policy also classifies cybersecurity as \"a central national priority\" and further requires the Department of Defence to develop a cyber defence capability that will enhance national cyber resilience.[114] The policy further mandates the Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to focus on cyber defence by establishing a cyber defence capability within the SANDF. However, beyond this brief recognition of information warfare in the Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, South Africa is yet to develop clear doctrines on cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n109 See Kenya Ministry of Defense, Defense White Paper (2017), p. 14.\n110 See M.

In addition, the Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy (2014) recognizes the country’s emerging opportunities in cyberspace to include exploitation of cyberspace to advance military capability in engaging external threats and conflicts. The Policy also classifies cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage and cyber conflict as major threats to Nigeria’s national security and stability.¹¹⁷\nUnder Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014), cyberspace is recognized as the fifth domain for driving critical national functions including national security and defence operations.¹¹⁸ The Strategy classifies sources of cyber threats to include foreign States and State sponsored actors and proposes to articulate an integrated containment of cyber threats including cyber conflict, violence and terror threats against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Strategy’s principle of integrated containment seeks to articulate containment measures which focus on shared responsibilities and cooperation among all State actors at the national, regional and global levels. However, the Strategy does not develop elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations, nor does it consider application of international law to cyber operations.\nRecently, the Office of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser reviewed its National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy to reflect emerging concerns on cyber threats and national security. Following the review, both the Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy are now contained in one document known as the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021). An element of the new Policy that relates to the threat of State sponsored cyber\n¹¹⁵ See Nigeria National Security Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p. 26.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n¹¹⁷ Ibid.\n¹¹⁸ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p.8, <https: cypersecurity=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" national_strategies_repository=\"\" natoria_2014_national_cybersecurity_strategy.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\noperations is the issue of foreign interference in elections. In this regard, the Policy recognizes that State and non-State actors have the potential to exert leverage on cyberspace to interfere with the electoral process including interference with elections' critical infrastructure and the conduct of cyber operations to disrupt or influence the electorate.^[119]^ Another relevant element of the Policy is that it seeks to mainstream voluntary non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace through international awareness and engagement.^[120]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to adopt voluntary non-binding norms that promote responsible State behaviour and also participate in ongoing international dialogue on cyber norms. The Policy also seeks to enhance Nigeria's cyber defence capability by investing in the military to identify, prevent and repel any cyber threats to Nigeria's sovereignty and national security.^[121]^\nThe Policy further proposes establishment of a Defence Space Administration that will coordinate the cyber activities of armed forces in defending Nigeria against cyberattacks.^[122]^ The Defence Space Administration is meant to work with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre to develop a national cyber defence plan for Nigeria. More importantly, the proposed National Cyber Defence Plan is meant to address cross-border cyberattacks while also \"embracing requisite restraints obligated under international law\".^[123]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to comply with existing international law when conducting cyber operations. Thus, given that Nigeria has not earlier stated the need for an international regime to regulate States in the conduct of cyber operations, it can therefore be argued to a large extent that the Policy's recognition of \"requisite restraints obligated under international law\" appears to indicate Nigeria's position on the applicability of existing international law to cyber operations conducted by States. Therefore, it can be argued that Nigeria supports the view of the United States and Western countries that existing international law applies to cyber operations.\nHowever, pending establishment of the National Cyber Defence Plan proposed in the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), the Policy in its present form does not establish elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber\n^[119]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abuja, 2021), pp. 5–6.\n^[120]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), p. 14.\n^[121]^ Ibid., p. 14.\n^[122]^ Ibid., pp. 41–42.\n^[123]^ Ibid., p. 42.\nUCHENNA ORJI\naggression or State sponsored cyber operations. Despite the absence of such doctrines, the Nigerian Army established a Cyber Warfare Command in 2018.¹²⁴ According to the Nigerian Army, the Cyber Warfare Command will be responsible for monitoring, defending and attacking subversive elements in cyberspace.¹²⁵ In 2020, the Nigerian Army Cyber Warfare Command launched its first cyber warfare exercise, which was described as Africa's first-ever cyber warfare exercise.¹²⁶ The exercise, according to the Nigerian Army, was designed to identify, track, and counter negative propaganda in social media and cyberspace.¹²⁷ However, the exercise raised human rights concerns given that it was launched during the nationwide campaign against police brutality known as the #ENDSARS campaign.¹²⁸ These concerns were further heightened by the exercise's objectives which appear to lend some credence to the view that the exercise sought to stifle online dissent during the #ENDSARS campaign.\n## 5 Challenges in Identifying African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nTo a large extent, African States and regional organizations have been absent from the ongoing international debate on norms for the governance of State behaviour in cyberspace. For example, since the commencement of the UNGGE process in 2004, only nine African countries have held its membership and such membership has been for a duration of not more than five\n¹²⁴ See K.

Thus, currently, many African States lack awareness about State sponsored cyber operations and the applicability of international law and this appears to reflect in their lack of policy and legal responses to issues in that regard. For example, no African State or regional organization has developed a robust regime on State sponsored cyber operations. Also no African State has clearly stated its position on the applicability of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations. This creates challenges in clearly identifying the position of African States on State sponsored cyber operations and therefore creates a situation where a broad interpretation of existing regimes has to be undertaken in order to attempt an identification of African positions. Also, to some extent, it may be argued that the mere participation of many African States in UNGGE processes may not really result in the easy identification of their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations if those States still lack robust cyber capabilities and basic capacities on cybersecurity governance. As such, in the absence of robust national cyber capabilities and basic cybersecurity governance capacities, the awareness that will be derived by African States following their participation in international cyber norms processes may produce little or no effect in terms of identifying their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nAnother challenge is that many African countries are still in the primary stages of tackling cybercrime and are in the process of establishing cybercrime laws, policies, and institutional frameworks. For example, as of 2021, many African countries did not have cybercrime laws, cybersecurity strategies or national Computer Emergency Response Teams.¹³⁰ There is also a lack of awareness amongst policy makers on issues relating to State sponsored cyber operations. For example, lack of awareness amongst policy makers in some countries has resulted in poor interest in funding training for cybersecurity skills due to fears over the dual use of such skills. In 2016, it was reported that\n¹²⁹ See E. Calandro and N.

Lack of awareness and funding is also caused by the fact that cybersecurity issues including the threat of State sponsored cyber operations is not really considered as a national security priority in many African States.¹³² This is also not unconnected with the fact that many African States face physical national security challenges such as terrorism which policy makers usually consider more pervasive than cybersecurity challenges.¹³³\n## 6 Conclusion\nWhile African regional organizations and States have established regional and national legal and policy measures to promote norms for cybersecurity governance, those measures largely focus on cybercrime control and cybersecurity governance.

Nevertheless, as discussed in this chapter, there exist some African regional and national legal and policy instruments that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. A broad interpretation of these legal and policy instruments in the light of the challenges of the information society, such as State sponsored cyber operations, can be used as a guide in locating probable African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. In particular, the AU Non-Aggression Pact can be broadly interpreted as constituting the common position of African countries towards State sponsored cyber operations. However, the AU Peace and Security Council in the exercise of its mandate should consider making updates to the Pact so as to clearly reflect cyber operations. In the present state of affairs in Africa, and the challenges of identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations, the question will remain largely unanswered for some time as to whether the positions of African States on the application of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations largely aligns with either the United States and Europe or with Russia and China. Thus, in the circumstances, it appears safer to conclude that most African States are still developing basic capabilities and are not yet aligned with either the views of the United States and Europe or with Russia and China towards State sponsored cyber operations.",
  "flat_text": "# Interrogating African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations: A Review of Regional and National Policies and Legal Responses\nUchenna Jerome Orji*\n## Abstract\nThere is potential that cyber capabilities can be deployed by States to achieve objectives that endanger international and regional peace and security. As such, there are growing concerns that State sponsored cyber operations can harm the critical infrastructure and information systems of other States. In Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. However, to a large extent the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. However, an inquiry has not been undertaken to identify emerging African positions on international law and State sponsored cyber operations. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to inquire into emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations within the context of international law. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter will further consider challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n* Asst.

However, the integration of computer and digital communications technologies into all aspects of life has redefined traditional notions of security. Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”. Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations. Thus, cyberspace has extended the battlefield and is viewed as the fifth battle space alongside the more traditional domains such as land, air, sea and space.\nIn furtherance of the above view, some States and international military organizations have developed defence doctrines which recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. For example, in 1999, the United States Department of Defense Report on the Legal Issues of Information Operations observed that there is “an obvious military interest in being able to interfere with an adversary’s information systems, and in being able to protect one’s own”. In 2010, the United States Department of Defense recognized cyberspace as a\n1. See M.

The United States Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace which was launched in July, 2011 recognizes that cyberspace, despite being a man-made domain, “is now a relevant domain for DoD activities as the naturally occurring domains of land, sea, air, and space”. Accordingly, the United States DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace declares that “the DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace’s potential”. In 2011, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the United Kingdom recognized that “cyberspace has now grown to become a domain where strategic advantage – industrial or military – can be won or lost”.\nSimilarly, in 2011, the Russian Federation Armed Forces’ Information Space Activities Concept recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations. The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept appears to largely classify cyberspace with the term “information space”. It defines “Military conflict in the information space” as “a form of interstate or intra-state conflicts with the use of information weapons”. The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept also defines “Information War” as:\nthe confrontation between two or more states in the information space with the purpose of inflicting damage to information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining the political, economic and social systems, a massive psychological manipulation of the population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force.\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2016, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) during its Warsaw Summit recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. In this regard, the NATO Cyber Pledge which was adopted at the Summit pledges to ensure that Member States are “capable of defending themselves in cyberspace as in the air, on land and at sea”. Therefore, cyberattacks with demonstrated aggressive intentions can trigger the collective security mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.\nWith the recognition of cyberspace as a domain of warfare, there have been growing concerns over the potential of State cyber operations to endanger international peace and security. This has prompted several calls to promote stability in cyberspace through the establishment of norms and legal regimes that promote responsible behaviour by States in cyberspace. Such calls led\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nthe United Nations (UN) to convene a Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States” and also to propose measures to address them. The UNGGE addressed issues relating to cyber operations by States and recommended that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law which intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public. This recommendation is, however, not legally binding on States, but rather provides a framework of international best practices that States should consider with a view to promoting cyber stability.\nIn Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa, however, appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. This chapter seeks to identify emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter further considers challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nThe chapter is divided into five sections. The first section is this introduction. The second section discusses the concept of State Sponsored Cyber Operations and Cyber Stability and also considers international law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations. It addresses the threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations in Africa. The third section identifies African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations by considering the provisions of African regional instruments such as the African Union Constitutive Act, African Union Declarations, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the African Union Non-Aggression Pact, the ECOWAS Protocol on Non-Aggression, and the SADC\n See UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174 (22 July 2015), 8 at paragraph 13(f).\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 2 State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nIn simple terms, State sponsored cyber operations refer to cyberattacks that are conducted by a State to disrupt or exploit the computer systems of a targeted State or cause harm to the computer systems and critical infrastructure of the targeted State with the objective of gaining an advantage over the targeted State. Such attacks may be conducted directly by a State through its institutions or through a non-State proxy with the support of a State. Targets of State sponsored cyber operations are usually critical infrastructure. However, all forms of computing devices connected to information networks are also potential targets of State sponsored cyber operations.\nState sponsored cyber operations can be executed through malicious cyber activities such as: the deployment of viruses, computer worms and malware that can disrupt and harm critical infrastructure; the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices; the use of hacking to steal critical data from institutions, governments and businesses; the use of ransomware to hold critical computer systems hostage; the use of cyber espionage to access national security information; and the use of online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within a country.\nA distinctive feature of State sponsored cyber operations is that they are generally cheaper than traditional military operations and can be carried out even by small States that may lack the technological capacities to carry out attacks. Such States can compensate for their disadvantage by hiring proxies. Therefore, at comparatively low risk and cost, significant damage and disruption can be inflicted on the intended target with little fear of reprisal given the challenges of attributing attacks to a particular individual or entity in cyberspace. Due to the challenge of attribution, State actors, criminal actors or non-State actors can loop through different computer systems in the process of perpetrating cyberattacks or even orchestrate attacks to appear to originate from government computers in another country. Thus, the problem of\nUCHENNA ORJI\nattribution creates uncertainty in identifying the origin of cyberattacks or the motive behind such attacks. As such, the nature of cyberspace gives disproportionate power to small and relatively insignificant malicious actors who can easily target foreign countries with a high degree of anonymity.\nSeveral reported cyber incidents have been classified as State sponsored cyber operations. For example, in May, 2007, Estonia experienced a series of massive and coordinated cyberattacks which targeted the country's public and private critical information infrastructure. The attacks deployed botnets of one over million computers located in over 50 countries around the world and the incident – classified as the world's first cyber war – is linked to Russia. In 2008, during the brief Russian-Georgia conflict, Georgia alleged that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against its government. Similar attacks were also launched against Georgia in 2019. The 2010 Stuxnet attack which targeted and destroyed Iran's nuclear centrifuges was reported to be a joint cyber operation between the United States and Israel code-named Olympic Games. In 2015, it was alleged that Russia had launched cyberattacks against Ukraine.\n See U.J.

Another definition refers to ‘cyber stability’ as “a geostrategic condition whereby users of the cyber domain enjoy the greatest possible benefits to political, civic, social, and economic life, while preventing and managing conduct that may undermine those benefits at the national, regional, and international levels”. It has been observed that this definition creates a basis from which to identify when stability is the goal and also to discern what is potentially relevant, useful, and strategic information about activity in the cyber domain from what is not. Cyber stability has also been defined as referring to “a state of relations between States characterized by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the States have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits”. The Report on a\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nFramework for International Cyber Stability, which was commissioned by the United States, defines cyber stability as “an environment where all participants, including nation-States, non-governmental organizations, commercial enterprises, and individuals, can positively and dependably enjoy the benefits of cyberspace; where there are benefits to cooperation and to avoidance of conflict, and where there are disincentives for these actors to engage in malicious cyber activity”.32\nA common thread that appears to run through the above definitions of cyber stability is that the concept aims to prevent conflict or hostilities in cyberspace. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability is used to classify measures that aim to prevent or minimize conflict between actors, including States, in cyberspace. As such, the concept aims to minimize threats and conduct that can escalate tensions between States in cyberspace. However, despite the above definitions of cyber stability, the concept is to a large extent regarded as an emerging concept that has not yet been developed as an analytic category.33\nAttempts have also been made to define an African view of cyber stability that is distinguishable from the global view.34 In this regard, it has been argued that in many ways the global views of cyber stability in dominant literature do not apply to African States and that the dominant views of cyber stability which promote regulatory openness, interoperability and global integration have been argued as differing from the views of African countries, which consider that global integration can bring instability through dependence.35 This argument may hold to the extent that many African States promote the idea of national self-sufficiency and independence in the development of information communications infrastructure so as to prevent digital colonialism and dependence on technologically advanced countries.36 However, that argument does not hold in the context of promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, because African States have taken steps to establish\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nregional and national measures to promote cybersecurity governance in compliance with global standards. For example, African States have established regional treaties to promote cybersecurity governance such as the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Directive on Fighting Cybercrime, which both require Member States to establish legal measures to criminalize and control cybercrimes and also establish frameworks for international cooperation on cybercrime. In addition, some African States are parties to international treaties such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime through which they participate in the Convention's extensive international cooperation framework and provide or receive mutual assistance from Western and non-Western countries that are parties to the Convention. These African developments tend towards regional and global integration in cybersecurity governance arrangements and challenge the argument that African States consider that global integration can bring instability through dependency.\nIn more practical terms, the concept of cyber stability aims to promote responsible State behaviour with a view to addressing the security challenges of the information society. This for example requires States to establish appropriate legal, policy and regulatory measures to protect cyber users and cyber infrastructure within their jurisdiction, and also ensure that cyber activities which are conducted within their jurisdiction do not cause harm to other individuals or infrastructure in another jurisdiction. The need to promote cyber stability arises from the increasing interconnectedness of national information communication networks in different countries. This has ushered in a new age of network interdependence where the security of each country's network is\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nalso dependent on the actions of State and non-State actors around the world. Thus, in this state of network interdependence, malicious cyber activities can have trans-boundary effects. Hence, malicious cyber activities which are conducted in a particular State can harm individuals or infrastructure located in another State. This also has potential to affect relations between States in a manner that can endanger international peace and security. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability requires States to maintain governance responsibility over cyber activities on their territory and refrain from cyber activities that can cause harm to persons or infrastructure in other States.\nThe concept of cyber stability enshrines elements of the international principles of trans-boundary harm and State responsibility. These principles were recognized in different contexts in the Corfu Channel Case, where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that a State may not \"allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\",[42] and in the Trail Smelter Case, where it was held that \"no State has right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein\".[43] These principles also exist in international telecommunications law. For example, Article 38.5 of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) requires Member States not to cause harm to the operation of telecommunications in other States. Thus, it declares that \"Member States recognize the necessity of taking practical measures to prevent the operation of electrical apparatus and installations of all kinds from disrupting the operation of telecommunication installations within the jurisdiction of other Member States\".[44]\n## 2.2 International Law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nCalls for norms and legal regimes to govern the conduct of States with respect to cyber activities that can endanger international peace and security $^{45}$ have sought to promote cyber stability by proposing the establishment of rules to ensure responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. $^{46}$ Such calls have led to\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nthe establishment of international initiatives to promote cyber stability. In this regard, issues concerning international cyber stability were first placed on the agenda of the UN by the Russian Federation in 1998 when it proposed UN General Assembly Resolution 53/70 on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was adopted without vote on 4 December, 1998 following a recommendation of the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security. Since then, that Resolution has been repeated annually. In particular, the Resolution noted the need to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, and expressed concerns that information technologies “can potentially be used for purposes that are consistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States”. Subsequently, between 2004 and 2017, the United Nations convened the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs [information and communication technologies] by States” and also propose measures to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence building measures.\nIn particular, the third UN GGE made several landmark conclusions, including that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\ncontrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public.53 It also concluded that “international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”.54 Other significant conclusions that were reached by the third UN GGE include that:\n(a) State sovereignty and international norms and principles which flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory;55\n(b) States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts and must also ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs, and that States must meet their obligations for internationally wrongful acts attributable to them.56\nHowever, while the UN GGE’s reports are not legally binding, their recommendations carry significant influence in shaping global cyber-security governance, as they can provide a basis for developing rules to promote responsible cyber conduct by States.\nAlso between 2009 and 2012, the Tallinn based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre convened an international group of distinguished international law academics to study how international law applies to cyber operations conducted by States.57 The study resulted in the publication of an academic and non-binding treatise known as the Tallinn Manual in 201358 with a second edition in 2017.59 The Manual generally advances the position that principles of existing international law apply to cyber operations without the need for new international legal regimes. However, while the United States and many Western countries support the view that existing international law applies to cyber operations without the need for new international\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 2.3 Africa and the Threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrica comprises 55 sovereign States and is classified as the world's second largest and second most populous continent after Asia, with a terrestrial mass of 30, 2044,049 million square kilometres and a human population of over one billion people. The continent has five geographical sub-regions, comprising: Southern Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, and West Africa. The African Union (AU) is the most prominent regional intergovernmental organization that unites African States and it comprises 55 sovereign States. Other notable intergovernmental organizations that operate within Africa's sub-regions include: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) which comprises 19 Member States, the Economic Community of West African West States (ECOWAS) which comprises 15 Member States, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) which comprises 16 Member States and the East African Community (EAC) which comprises six States.\nThe increasing penetration of ICTs in Africa has been followed with their growing integration in critical national sectors. For example, banking and financial services sectors in African States are increasingly integrating ICTs to enhance service delivery and improve consumer satisfaction. Also, across\n See E.

For example, in January, 2018, China denied that the computer network equipment it had supplied to the AU allowed it to access confidential information from the AU.73 In June 2020, following a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam being built on the Nile River, it was reported that Egyptian hackers had launched cyberattacks on a number of Ethiopian websites.74 In December, 2020, it was reported that Chinese hackers had been accessing the security footage from cameras installed at the AU headquarters. Also in December, 2020, it was reported that Facebook found that\nApplications (2012), pp. 145-150; M. Andrianaivo and Kangni Kpodar, 'ICT, Financial Inclusion, and Growth: Evidence from African Countries', WP/11/73 IMF Working Paper, (2011), pp. 4-41.\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nRussians and individuals affiliated with the French military were using fake Facebook accounts to conduct information operations in Africa.75\nAlready, several African States and regional organizations have established legal measures to promote cybersecurity governance. For example, in 2011, the ECOWAS adopted a Directive to fight cybercrime within the ECOWAS region.76 Also in 2011, COMESA developed a Model Cybercrime Bill with a view to providing a uniform framework that would serve as a guide for the development of cybercrime laws in Member States.77 In 2012, the SADC adopted a Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime to serve as a guide for the development of cybersecurity laws in SADC Member States.78 In 2014, the AU adopted the Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection to harmonize the laws of African States on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control.79 To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa has been on curbing cybercrime and it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace by African States. However, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n## 3 Identifying African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrican regional organizations have legal instruments on cybersecurity such as the ECOWAS Directive on Cybercrime, the COMESA Model Cybercrime Bill, the SADC Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime, the AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Cybersecurity Strategy. However, these instruments only focus on cybersecurity governance and cybercrime control and have not explicitly addressed State sponsored\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\noperations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional instruments and declarations that could indicate emerging positions on State sponsored cyber operations. Such instruments and declarations exist within the framework of African regional organizations such as the AU, the ECOWAS, and the SADC and will now be discussed.\n## 3.1 The Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU)\nThe Constitutive Act sets down the Objectives of the Union, which include inter alia to: \"promote peace, security, and stability on the continent\". In furtherance of its objectives, the AU establishes a range of governing principles which include: the establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent; a prohibition of the use of force or threat to use force among Member States of the Union; non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another; the right of Member States to live and coexist in peace and security; and rejection of acts of impunity, acts of terrorism and subversive activities. These principles in the AU Constitutive Act do not expressly mention cyber stability; however, they can be broadly interpreted as accommodating recent developments that affect cyber stability. For example, acts that affect the peace, security and stability of African States in contemporary times include State sponsored cyber operations that target critical national infrastructure and data. As such, the above principles of the AU Constitutive Act impose broad positive obligations on Member States to refrain from engaging in acts that will affect the peace, security and stability of Africa regardless of whether such acts were conducted offline or through cyberspace.\nIt is also possible for the AU principle on the prohibition of non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another Member State could be violated by State sponsored cyber operations that seek to use hacking operations or online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within an African State. This would apply to instances where a Member State uses hacking operations to influence the election outcome in another Member State or where a Member State uses online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption within another Member State with the objective of achieving a negative state of affairs in the targeted State. In addition, the AU principle on the prohibition of subversive activities would broadly apply to acts of subversion carried out through the cyberspace by a Member State against another Member State. For example, cyberspace can be used to spread disinformation or hate speech with the aim of creating dissension and destabilizing a Member State. Therefore, the principle of prohibition of subversive activities establishes broad positive obligations that would require a Member State to prevent its\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nterritory and resources from being used to encourage or commit acts of subversion against another Member State through cyberspace.\n## 3.2 The AU Non-aggression and Common Defence Pact\nThe AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact was adopted in 2005 and seeks “to put an end to conflicts of any kind within and among States in Africa in order to create conditions for socio-economic development and integration of the continent as well as the fulfilment of the aspirations of [African] peoples”. The Pact entered into force on 18 December 2009 after its ratification by 15 AU Member States. As of August, 2021, 44 AU Member States had signed the Pact, while 22 Member States had ratified it. To a large extent, the Pact is regarded as containing by far “the most elaborate political commitment of African States not to commit aggression against each other”.\nThe Pact elaborately defines ‘aggression’ as “the use, intentionally, and knowingly, of armed force or any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity, against the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and human security of the population of a State party to this Pact, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations or the Constitutive Act of the African Union ...”. Some elements of the above definition of aggression appear to create broad scope for classifying hostile cyber operations conducted by a Member State against another Member State within the meaning of aggression. For example, the Pact does not restrict the definition of aggression to the use of ‘armed force’, but includes ‘any other hostile act’ conducted by a State or non-State actor against the ‘sovereignty’ and ‘human security’ of the population of a Member State. In modern times, hostile acts against the sovereignty of a State would include disruption of its critical information infrastructure,\n See U.J. Orji, ‘Rethinking the African Union Non-Aggression Treaty as a Framework for Promoting Responsible in Cyberspace’, Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public &amp; International Law (MPII) Research Paper Series, No. 2021–24, (September, 2021), pp.7–20, <https: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"3930007\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n See Preamble to the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact (2005).\n See The Status List: AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact, (January, 2020) <https: africa-union-non-aggression-and-common-defence-pact=\"\" en=\"\" au.int=\"\" treaties=\"\" treaties@africa-union-non-aggression-and-common-defence-pact=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n See Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression, Preventing Aggression in the African Context, <https: 8=\"\" documents=\"\" crimeofaggression.info=\"\" bots_aggression_in_africa.pdf=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact (Emphasis added).</https:></https:></https:>\nUCHENNA ORJI\ngiven the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security. As such, under the Pact, there is scope for classifying a Member State's cyber operations that disrupts another Member State's critical information infrastructure as a hostile act that fits into the definition of aggression under the Pact.\nThe Pact's broad definition of aggression as including “... any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity ...” also provides a basis for considering application of the Pact as an African framework for regulating State cyber operations. This is because hostile acts that violate the sovereignty of a State would include attacks that target its critical information infrastructure, given the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.\nIn addition, specific acts that constitute ‘acts of aggression’ (regardless of a declaration of war) under the Pact include: the use of any weapon against the territory of a Member State; the blockade of the ports, coasts or airspace of a Member State; the action of a Member State in allowing its territory to be used by another Member State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; and technological assistance of any kind, intelligence and training to another State for use in committing acts of aggression against another Member State. Thus, the above elements that exist within the definition of aggression provide broad scope for considering the Pact as a framework that applies to State cyber operations. For example, ‘any weapon’ within the context of the Pact would technically include a cyber-weapon such as malware, given that such a weapon can be used to execute an attack against critical information infrastructure located in the territory of a Member State. Also, cyberattacks can be used to conduct a blockade of Member State ports, coasts or airspace, while the use of a cyber-weapon to immobilize the armed forces or marine fleets of a Member State would technically fit within the Pact’s definition of aggression. This also applies where a Member State engages in acts of cyber espionage which could be used for military aggression against another Member State or provides another Member State with technological assistance of any kind such as cyber capability to conduct aggression against another Member State. In addition, a Member State that allows its territory to be used by another Member State to conduct cyberattacks against another Member State or provides support\n Art. 1 AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.\n See Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact [emphasis added].\n Ibid.\n See C.

The Council functions as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and efficient response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa.89 The Peace and Security Council, which is responsible for implementing the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact,90 is required to periodically update the Pact so as to enhance its implementation in light of contemporary security challenges.91 While the Council has not carried out any update to reflect cyber-security challenges such as State sponsored cyber operations, recent developments appear to indicate that the Council is developing a position on State sponsored cyber operations. In May, 2019, the Council issued a Communiqué on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa. The Communiqué recognized \"the increasing vulnerability of the entire Continent to the growing threat of cyber-crimes/cyberattacks\".92 In particular, the Council expressed concerns that \"a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely\" and that \"increasing global threats to Cyber Security ... constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security\".93 In furtherance of these concerns, the Council requested the AU Commission to work in collaboration with the AU Department for Peace and Security, Member States and the Regional Economic Communities to expeditiously develop a Continental Cyber Security Strategy and to report back to\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nthe Council before the 2020 Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government. However, while to some extent the above statements indicate the Council's emerging position on State cyber operations, the proposed AU Continental Cyber Security Strategy is yet to be developed to clearly express the AU's position on State cyber operations.\n## 3.4 Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa\nIn November 2019, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights adopted the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. The Declaration was adopted pursuant to Article 45(1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, which mandates the African Commission to promote human and peoples' rights by formulating principles and rules to address legal problems relating to human and peoples' rights and fundamental freedoms upon which African States may base their legislation. The Declaration affirms the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and access to information enshrined in Article 9 of the African Charter. Principle 38 of the Declaration prohibits Member States from interfering with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. In this regard, Principle 38 (1) of the Declaration states that:\nStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\nMore importantly, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration provides that:\nStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n Ibid, at paragraph 13.\n See Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa.

Thus, in fulfilling the above positive obligation a Member State is not only required to refrain from conducting cyber operations that will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, but the obligation further requires a Member State to condemn and refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors that conduct cyber operations to disrupt Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, including critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education.\n## 3.5 The ECOWAS\nThe founding Treaty of the ECOWAS establishes its objectives, which include: promoting regional cooperation and integration and maintaining peace, stability and security within the region.97 In pursuance of the objectives to maintain peace, stability and security within the region, the ECOWAS adopted a Protocol on Non-Aggression in 1978, which imposes obligations on Member States to refrain from using \"force or aggression\" and \"any other means inconsistent with\" the Charter of the United Nations or Constitutive Act of the AU against the territorial integrity and political independence of\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nother Member States. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations. However, its provisions can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 2 of the Protocol requires every Member State to “refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States”. The Protocol does not define the meaning of terms such as ‘subversion’, ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’, hence resort shall be had to other definitions of those terms. ‘Subversion’ simply refers to undermining the power and authority of an established system or institution or State. ‘Hostility’ refers to hostile or unfriendly behaviour such as acts of warfare. Similarly, ‘aggression’ refers to hostile behaviour such as the act of attacking a State. Thus, a broad interpretation of acts of ‘subversion’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will include State sponsored cyber operations that seek to undermine the power and authority of a Member State. This, for example, will include State sponsored online disinformation campaigns that are targeted to cause disruption and chaos within another Member State. A broad interpretation of acts of ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will also include State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure located within the territory of a Member State. In addition, fulfilment of the obligation under Article 2 of the Protocol will require Member States to condemn cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure in another Member State and also to refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors in the conduct of such operations.\nArticle 3 of the Protocol further imposes obligations on Member States to prevent foreigners resident within their territories from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other Member States. A broad interpretation of this obligation in the context of cyber operations implies, for example, that Member States are required to hold foreigners resident within their territories accountable where they engage in or encourage cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State. In addition, the Protocol requires every Member State to prevent “non-resident foreigners”\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 3.6 The SADC\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the SADC is to safeguard peace, stability and security within the SADC region. In pursuance of this objective, the SADC adopted a Mutual Defence Protocol in August, 2003. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations; however, Article 8 of the Protocol can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 8 of the Protocol provides that: “State parties undertake not to nurture, harbour or support any person, group of persons or institutions whose aim is to destabilize the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party”. Article 2 of the Protocol defines the term destabilize as:\nto instigate, plan, execute or assist in any of the following:\n(a) an armed attack against a State party;\n(b) sabotage aimed at the people of a State Party or an asset of a State party, whether inside or outside the territory of the State party; or,\n(c) any act or activity aimed at changing the constitutional order of a State Party through unconstitutional mean.\nIn light of the above definition of destabilization, a broad interpretation of Article 8 of the Protocol would require, for example, that a State Party is to refrain from nurturing, harbouring, instigating or supporting any person, group of persons or institutions that seek to carry out cyber operations with the aim of disrupting or sabotaging national critical information infrastructure with a view to destabilizing the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party. The SADC has also recognized a connection between cybersecurity and regional instability. For example, in 2004, the SADC Strategic Plan on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation recognized the need to build capacity to combat cybercrime and terrorism in\n See Art. 2 SADC Mutual Defense Protocol (2003).\nUCHENNA ORJI\norder to protect the region against instability arising from intrastate conflicts and aggression.\n## 4 Identifying National Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nOnly a few African countries have considered issues relating to cyber conflict in their laws and policies on national security and cybersecurity. In most cases, such issues have been highlighted briefly in laws and policy instruments without providing clear definitions or national doctrines. For example, in Ghana, the Cybersecurity Act provides for the establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority which will be responsible “for taking measures in response to cybersecurity incidents that occur within and outside the country which may threaten national security; the defence of the country; the economy of the country; [and] international relations between the State and other countries”. However, aside from this provision, Ghana has not established a clear national doctrine that addresses cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Malawi, the National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes the development of a cybersecurity contingency plan that will include the role of the military during cyberattacks and emergencies. The Strategy also proposes the development of a Cyber Defence Strategy that establishes approaches to addressing national security threats in cyberspace. The Strategy further grants the military a prominent role in the management of cybersecurity incidents. In this regard, the Strategy provides that the Malawi Defence Force in collaboration with the Malawi Computer Emergency Response Team “will continuously monitor the cyberspace sphere to identify and address cyber threats and risks to the National Security of Malawi”. However, aside from the above declarations in Malawi’s National Cybersecurity Strategy, the country is yet to develop a clear national doctrine that addresses State sponsored cyber operations or acts of aggression in cyberspace. Similarly, in Kenya, the government prescribes a broad role for the Ministry of Defence in cybersecurity governance.\n See SADC Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (2004), p. 38.\n See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy (2019–2024), p. 16, <https: 160=\"\" api.pppc.mw=\"\" national-cybers-col.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n Ibid.\n See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy, p. 29.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn this regard, the Kenyan Ministry of Defence White Paper declares that \"cyber-attacks can undermine State security. [The] Ministry of Defence in collaboration with other stakeholders must develop appropriate capacity and institute measures to safeguard information systems\".[109] However, beyond this declaration, Kenya is yet to develop the role of the military in the management of cybersecurity threats, and the country is yet to develop a policy on cyber defence or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Morocco, the military plays a prominent role in cybersecurity governance. In this regard, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has the responsibility of overseeing the development of cybersecurity and cyber defence capabilities and for ensuring the resilience and availability of the country's military operational networks.[110] Morocco has also developed several cyber-related capabilities; however, despite the military's role in the management of cybersecurity threats, the country is yet to develop a formalized military policy or electronic on cybersecurity.[111]\nSouth Africa appears to be the only African country that has recognized cyber warfare concerns in its national defence policy. In this regard, South Africa's Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 recognizes that \"information warfare\" including the targeting of political institutions and processes, is a national concern.[112] In a military context, the policy classifies South African cyberspace as a \"domain\" under \"the physical control and political authority of the South African State\".[113] The policy also classifies cybersecurity as \"a central national priority\" and further requires the Department of Defence to develop a cyber defence capability that will enhance national cyber resilience.[114] The policy further mandates the Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to focus on cyber defence by establishing a cyber defence capability within the SANDF. However, beyond this brief recognition of information warfare in the Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, South Africa is yet to develop clear doctrines on cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nIn Nigeria, the National Security Strategy recognizes that “cyber threats are inherently asymmetrical with an increasing range of actors engaged in espionage and warfare”. The Strategy also classifies four major cyber threats with significant capability to damage Nigeria’s national security and economy to include: cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and “cyber conflict”. The Strategy further proposes development of a national strategic framework dedicated to cyber defence including capacity building programmes for the military. In addition, the Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy (2014) recognizes the country’s emerging opportunities in cyberspace to include exploitation of cyberspace to advance military capability in engaging external threats and conflicts. The Policy also classifies cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage and cyber conflict as major threats to Nigeria’s national security and stability.\nUnder Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014), cyberspace is recognized as the fifth domain for driving critical national functions including national security and defence operations. The Strategy classifies sources of cyber threats to include foreign States and State sponsored actors and proposes to articulate an integrated containment of cyber threats including cyber conflict, violence and terror threats against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Strategy’s principle of integrated containment seeks to articulate containment measures which focus on shared responsibilities and cooperation among all State actors at the national, regional and global levels. However, the Strategy does not develop elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations, nor does it consider application of international law to cyber operations.\nRecently, the Office of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser reviewed its National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy to reflect emerging concerns on cyber threats and national security. Following the review, both the Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy are now contained in one document known as the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021). An element of the new Policy that relates to the threat of State sponsored cyber\n See Nigeria National Security Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p. 26.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p.8, <https: cypersecurity=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" national_strategies_repository=\"\" natoria_2014_national_cybersecurity_strategy.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\noperations is the issue of foreign interference in elections. In this regard, the Policy recognizes that State and non-State actors have the potential to exert leverage on cyberspace to interfere with the electoral process including interference with elections' critical infrastructure and the conduct of cyber operations to disrupt or influence the electorate.^[119]^ Another relevant element of the Policy is that it seeks to mainstream voluntary non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace through international awareness and engagement.^[120]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to adopt voluntary non-binding norms that promote responsible State behaviour and also participate in ongoing international dialogue on cyber norms. The Policy also seeks to enhance Nigeria's cyber defence capability by investing in the military to identify, prevent and repel any cyber threats to Nigeria's sovereignty and national security.^[121]^\nThe Policy further proposes establishment of a Defence Space Administration that will coordinate the cyber activities of armed forces in defending Nigeria against cyberattacks.^[122]^ The Defence Space Administration is meant to work with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre to develop a national cyber defence plan for Nigeria. More importantly, the proposed National Cyber Defence Plan is meant to address cross-border cyberattacks while also \"embracing requisite restraints obligated under international law\".^[123]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to comply with existing international law when conducting cyber operations. Thus, given that Nigeria has not earlier stated the need for an international regime to regulate States in the conduct of cyber operations, it can therefore be argued to a large extent that the Policy's recognition of \"requisite restraints obligated under international law\" appears to indicate Nigeria's position on the applicability of existing international law to cyber operations conducted by States. Therefore, it can be argued that Nigeria supports the view of the United States and Western countries that existing international law applies to cyber operations.\nHowever, pending establishment of the National Cyber Defence Plan proposed in the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), the Policy in its present form does not establish elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber\n^[119]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abuja, 2021), pp. 5–6.\n^[120]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), p. 14.\n^[121]^ Ibid., p. 14.\n^[122]^ Ibid., pp. 41–42.\n^[123]^ Ibid., p. 42.\nUCHENNA ORJI\naggression or State sponsored cyber operations. Despite the absence of such doctrines, the Nigerian Army established a Cyber Warfare Command in 2018. According to the Nigerian Army, the Cyber Warfare Command will be responsible for monitoring, defending and attacking subversive elements in cyberspace. In 2020, the Nigerian Army Cyber Warfare Command launched its first cyber warfare exercise, which was described as Africa's first-ever cyber warfare exercise. The exercise, according to the Nigerian Army, was designed to identify, track, and counter negative propaganda in social media and cyberspace. However, the exercise raised human rights concerns given that it was launched during the nationwide campaign against police brutality known as the #ENDSARS campaign. These concerns were further heightened by the exercise's objectives which appear to lend some credence to the view that the exercise sought to stifle online dissent during the #ENDSARS campaign.\n## 5 Challenges in Identifying African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nTo a large extent, African States and regional organizations have been absent from the ongoing international debate on norms for the governance of State behaviour in cyberspace. For example, since the commencement of the UNGGE process in 2004, only nine African countries have held its membership and such membership has been for a duration of not more than five\n See K.

The absence of many African States and regional organizations in the UNGGE process apparently has an effect on their levels of awareness of State sponsored cyber operations and the application of international law in that context. Thus, currently, many African States lack awareness about State sponsored cyber operations and the applicability of international law and this appears to reflect in their lack of policy and legal responses to issues in that regard. For example, no African State or regional organization has developed a robust regime on State sponsored cyber operations. Also no African State has clearly stated its position on the applicability of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations. This creates challenges in clearly identifying the position of African States on State sponsored cyber operations and therefore creates a situation where a broad interpretation of existing regimes has to be undertaken in order to attempt an identification of African positions. Also, to some extent, it may be argued that the mere participation of many African States in UNGGE processes may not really result in the easy identification of their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations if those States still lack robust cyber capabilities and basic capacities on cybersecurity governance. As such, in the absence of robust national cyber capabilities and basic cybersecurity governance capacities, the awareness that will be derived by African States following their participation in international cyber norms processes may produce little or no effect in terms of identifying their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nAnother challenge is that many African countries are still in the primary stages of tackling cybercrime and are in the process of establishing cybercrime laws, policies, and institutional frameworks. For example, as of 2021, many African countries did not have cybercrime laws, cybersecurity strategies or national Computer Emergency Response Teams. There is also a lack of awareness amongst policy makers on issues relating to State sponsored cyber operations. For example, lack of awareness amongst policy makers in some countries has resulted in poor interest in funding training for cybersecurity skills due to fears over the dual use of such skills. In 2016, it was reported that\n See E. Calandro and N. Berglund, *Bridging The Cyber Norms Debate With Evidence*, Discussion paper submitted to the UN Open Ended Working Group (OWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Communications Technology in the Context of International Security, pp. 1–3, <https: 12=\"\" 2019=\"\" discussion-paper-oewg-international-meeting.pdf=\"\"ிழoloads=\"\" www.un.org=\"\" ww.gov=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n See U.J.

The challenges of lack of awareness amongst policy makers and poor funding limit research and development initiatives that could help in developing the positions of African States on State sponsored cyber operations. Lack of awareness and funding is also caused by the fact that cybersecurity issues including the threat of State sponsored cyber operations is not really considered as a national security priority in many African States. This is also not unconnected with the fact that many African States face physical national security challenges such as terrorism which policy makers usually consider more pervasive than cybersecurity challenges.\n## 6 Conclusion\nWhile African regional organizations and States have established regional and national legal and policy measures to promote norms for cybersecurity governance, those measures largely focus on cybercrime control and cybersecurity governance. Although such measures show the willingness of African States to promote cyber stability, they do not address concerns relating to State\n See N.K.

    "## 1 Introduction": "A core feature of the information age is the continuous integration of computers and digital communication technologies in virtually all aspects of life and critical services that support modern societies and the tendency towards “connecting everything to everything”.¹ However, the integration of computer and digital communications technologies into all aspects of life has redefined traditional notions of security. Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”.² Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations. Thus, cyberspace has extended the battlefield and is viewed as the fifth battle space alongside the more traditional domains such as land, air, sea and space.\nIn furtherance of the above view, some States and international military organizations have developed defence doctrines which recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. For example, in 1999, the United States Department of Defense Report on the Legal Issues of Information Operations observed that there is “an obvious military interest in being able to interfere with an adversary’s information systems, and in being able to protect one’s own”.³ In 2010, the United States Department of Defense recognized cyberspace as a\n1.

It defines “Military conflict in the information space” as “a form of interstate or intra-state conflicts with the use of information weapons”.⁹ The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept also defines “Information War” as:\nthe confrontation between two or more states in the information space with the purpose of inflicting damage to information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining the political, economic and social systems, a massive psychological manipulation of the population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force.¹⁰\n4 See C.

The form of war is accelerating to its evolution to informationalization”.¹²\nIn 2016, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) during its Warsaw Summit recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare.¹³ In this regard, the NATO Cyber Pledge which was adopted at the Summit pledges to ensure that Member States are “capable of defending themselves in cyberspace as in the air, on land and at sea”.¹⁴ Therefore, cyberattacks with demonstrated aggressive intentions can trigger the collective security mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.¹⁵\nWith the recognition of cyberspace as a domain of warfare, there have been growing concerns over the potential of State cyber operations to endanger international peace and security. This has prompted several calls to promote stability in cyberspace through the establishment of norms and legal regimes that promote responsible behaviour by States in cyberspace. Such calls led\n11 See B. Lilly and J. Cheravitch, ‘The Past, Present, and Future of Russia’s Cyber Strategy and Forces’, in T. Jančárková, et al., (eds.) Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE, Tallinn, 2020), pp. 133–134.\n12 See The State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China, China’s Military Strategy (Beijing, 27 May 2015). China’s Military Strategy further observed that: “Cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security. As international strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fiercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces. Being one of the major victims of hacker attacks, China is confronted with grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure. As cyberspace weighs more in military security, China will expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defense, support for the country’s endeavors in cyberspace and participation in international cyber cooperation, so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability”.\n13 See J.

The UNGGE addressed issues relating to cyber operations by States and recommended that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law which intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public.¹⁶ This recommendation is, however, not legally binding on States, but rather provides a framework of international best practices that States should consider with a view to promoting cyber stability.\nIn Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa, however, appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. This chapter seeks to identify emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter further considers challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nThe chapter is divided into five sections. The first section is this introduction. The second section discusses the concept of State Sponsored Cyber Operations and Cyber Stability and also considers international law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations. It addresses the threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations in Africa. The third section identifies African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations by considering the provisions of African regional instruments such as the African Union Constitutive Act, African Union Declarations, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the African Union Non-Aggression Pact, the ECOWAS Protocol on Non-Aggression, and the SADC\n¹⁶ See UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174 (22 July 2015), 8 at paragraph 13(f).\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n241\nMutual Defence Protocol. In this regard, the provisions of the above regional instruments are examined with a view to applying them to State sponsored cyber operations. The fourth section identifies African national positions on State sponsored cyber operations by examining legal and policy instruments on cybersecurity and national security. The fifth section highlights challenges in identifying African national positions on State sponsored cyber operations and then the conclusion follows.",
    "## 2 State Sponsored Cyber Operations": "In simple terms, State sponsored cyber operations refer to cyberattacks that are conducted by a State to disrupt or exploit the computer systems of a targeted State or cause harm to the computer systems and critical infrastructure of the targeted State with the objective of gaining an advantage over the targeted State. Such attacks may be conducted directly by a State through its institutions or through a non-State proxy with the support of a State. Targets of State sponsored cyber operations are usually critical infrastructure. However, all forms of computing devices connected to information networks are also potential targets of State sponsored cyber operations.\nState sponsored cyber operations can be executed through malicious cyber activities such as: the deployment of viruses, computer worms and malware that can disrupt and harm critical infrastructure; the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices; the use of hacking to steal critical data from institutions, governments and businesses; the use of ransomware to hold critical computer systems hostage; the use of cyber espionage to access national security information; and the use of online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within a country.\nA distinctive feature of State sponsored cyber operations is that they are generally cheaper than traditional military operations and can be carried out even by small States that may lack the technological capacities to carry out attacks. Such States can compensate for their disadvantage by hiring proxies. Therefore, at comparatively low risk and cost, significant damage and disruption can be inflicted on the intended target with little fear of reprisal given the challenges of attributing attacks to a particular individual or entity in cyberspace. Due to the challenge of attribution, State actors, criminal actors or non-State actors can loop through different computer systems in the process of perpetrating cyberattacks or even orchestrate attacks to appear to originate from government computers in another country. Thus, the problem of\nUCHENNA ORJI\nattribution creates uncertainty in identifying the origin of cyberattacks or the motive behind such attacks.¹⁷ As such, the nature of cyberspace gives disproportionate power to small and relatively insignificant malicious actors who can easily target foreign countries with a high degree of anonymity.¹⁸\nSeveral reported cyber incidents have been classified as State sponsored cyber operations. For example, in May, 2007, Estonia experienced a series of massive and coordinated cyberattacks which targeted the country's public and private critical information infrastructure.¹⁹ The attacks deployed botnets of one over million computers located in over 50 countries around the world²⁰ and the incident – classified as the world's first cyber war – is linked to Russia.²¹ In 2008, during the brief Russian-Georgia conflict, Georgia alleged that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against its government.²² Similar attacks were also launched against Georgia in 2019.²³ The 2010 Stuxnet attack which targeted and destroyed Iran's nuclear centrifuges was reported to be a joint cyber operation between the United States and Israel code-named Olympic Games.²⁴ In 2015, it was alleged that Russia had launched cyberattacks against Ukraine.²⁵\n¹⁷ See U.J.

Therefore, the concept of cyber stability is used to classify measures that aim to prevent or minimize conflict between actors, including States, in cyberspace. As such, the concept aims to minimize threats and conduct that can escalate tensions between States in cyberspace. However, despite the above definitions of cyber stability, the concept is to a large extent regarded as an emerging concept that has not yet been developed as an analytic category.33\nAttempts have also been made to define an African view of cyber stability that is distinguishable from the global view.34 In this regard, it has been argued that in many ways the global views of cyber stability in dominant literature do not apply to African States and that the dominant views of cyber stability which promote regulatory openness, interoperability and global integration have been argued as differing from the views of African countries, which consider that global integration can bring instability through dependence.35 This argument may hold to the extent that many African States promote the idea of national self-sufficiency and independence in the development of information communications infrastructure so as to prevent digital colonialism and dependence on technologically advanced countries.36 However, that argument does not hold in the context of promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, because African States have taken steps to establish\n32 See International Security Advisory Board, Report on a Framework for International Cyber Stability (United States Department of State, 2 July 2014) Appendix B.1, at p. 33.\n33 See L.

For example, African States have established regional treaties to promote cybersecurity governance such as the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection³⁷ and the ECOWAS Directive on Fighting Cybercrime,³⁸ which both require Member States to establish legal measures to criminalize and control cybercrimes and also establish frameworks for international cooperation on cybercrime.³⁹ In addition, some African States are parties to international treaties such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime⁴⁰ through which they participate in the Convention's extensive international cooperation framework and provide or receive mutual assistance from Western and non-Western countries that are parties to the Convention.⁴¹ These African developments tend towards regional and global integration in cybersecurity governance arrangements and challenge the argument that African States consider that global integration can bring instability through dependency.\nIn more practical terms, the concept of cyber stability aims to promote responsible State behaviour with a view to addressing the security challenges of the information society. This for example requires States to establish appropriate legal, policy and regulatory measures to protect cyber users and cyber infrastructure within their jurisdiction, and also ensure that cyber activities which are conducted within their jurisdiction do not cause harm to other individuals or infrastructure in another jurisdiction. The need to promote cyber stability arises from the increasing interconnectedness of national information communication networks in different countries. This has ushered in a new age of network interdependence where the security of each country's network is\n37 See African Union (AU) Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, EX.CL/846(XXV) adopted at the 23rd Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union (Malabo, 27 June 2014).\n38 See ECOWAS Directive C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime, adopted at the Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers at Abuja, Nigeria (August 2011).\n39 See U.J.

Thus, in this state of network interdependence, malicious cyber activities can have trans-boundary effects. Hence, malicious cyber activities which are conducted in a particular State can harm individuals or infrastructure located in another State. This also has potential to affect relations between States in a manner that can endanger international peace and security. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability requires States to maintain governance responsibility over cyber activities on their territory and refrain from cyber activities that can cause harm to persons or infrastructure in other States.\nThe concept of cyber stability enshrines elements of the international principles of trans-boundary harm and State responsibility. These principles were recognized in different contexts in the Corfu Channel Case, where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that a State may not \"allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\", and in the Trail Smelter Case, where it was held that \"no State has right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein\". These principles also exist in international telecommunications law. For example, Article 38.5 of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) requires Member States not to cause harm to the operation of telecommunications in other States. Thus, it declares that \"Member States recognize the necessity of taking practical measures to prevent the operation of electrical apparatus and installations of all kinds from disrupting the operation of telecommunication installations within the jurisdiction of other Member States\".\n## 2.2 International Law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nCalls for norms and legal regimes to govern the conduct of States with respect to cyber activities that can endanger international peace and security $^{45}$ have sought to promote cyber stability by proposing the establishment of rules to ensure responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. $^{46}$ Such calls have led to\n42 See The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v.

In this regard, issues concerning international cyber stability were first placed on the agenda of the UN by the Russian Federation in 1998 when it proposed UN General Assembly Resolution 53/70 on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was adopted without vote on 4 December, 1998⁴⁷ following a recommendation of the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security.⁴⁸ Since then, that Resolution has been repeated annually.⁴⁹ In particular, the Resolution noted the need to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, and expressed concerns that information technologies “can potentially be used for purposes that are consistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States”.⁵⁰ Subsequently, between 2004 and 2017, the United Nations convened the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs [information and communication technologies] by States” and also propose measures to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence building measures.⁵¹\nIn particular, the third UN GGE⁵² made several landmark conclusions, including that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity\n47 See UN General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n48 See UN General Assembly, Role of Science and Technology in the Context of Security, Disarmament and Other related Fields, Report of the First Committee, A/53/576 (18 November, 1998).\n49 See UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, <https: disarmament=\"\" informationsecurity=\"\" topics=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></https:>, visited on 15 February 2022.

The African Union (AU) is the most prominent regional intergovernmental organization that unites African States and it comprises 55 sovereign States.⁶³ Other notable intergovernmental organizations that operate within Africa's sub-regions include: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)⁶⁴ which comprises 19 Member States, the Economic Community of West African West States (ECOWAS)⁶⁵ which comprises 15 Member States, the Southern African Development Community (SADC)⁶⁶ which comprises 16 Member States and the East African Community (EAC) which comprises six States.\nThe increasing penetration of ICTs in Africa⁶⁷ has been followed with their growing integration in critical national sectors.⁶⁸ For example, banking and financial services sectors in African States are increasingly integrating ICTs to enhance service delivery and improve consumer satisfaction.⁶⁹ Also, across\n⁶⁰ See E.

For example, in 2011, the ECOWAS adopted a Directive to fight cybercrime within the ECOWAS region.76 Also in 2011, COMESA developed a Model Cybercrime Bill with a view to providing a uniform framework that would serve as a guide for the development of cybercrime laws in Member States.77 In 2012, the SADC adopted a Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime to serve as a guide for the development of cybersecurity laws in SADC Member States.78 In 2014, the AU adopted the Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection to harmonize the laws of African States on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control.79 To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa has been on curbing cybercrime and it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace by African States. However, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.",

Nevertheless, there are African regional instruments and declarations that could indicate emerging positions on State sponsored cyber operations. Such instruments and declarations exist within the framework of African regional organizations such as the AU, the ECOWAS, and the SADC and will now be discussed.\n## 3.1 The Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU)\nThe Constitutive Act sets down the Objectives of the Union, which include inter alia to: \"promote peace, security, and stability on the continent\". In furtherance of its objectives, the AU establishes a range of governing principles which include: the establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent; a prohibition of the use of force or threat to use force among Member States of the Union; non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another; the right of Member States to live and coexist in peace and security; and rejection of acts of impunity, acts of terrorism and subversive activities. These principles in the AU Constitutive Act do not expressly mention cyber stability; however, they can be broadly interpreted as accommodating recent developments that affect cyber stability. For example, acts that affect the peace, security and stability of African States in contemporary times include State sponsored cyber operations that target critical national infrastructure and data. As such, the above principles of the AU Constitutive Act impose broad positive obligations on Member States to refrain from engaging in acts that will affect the peace, security and stability of Africa regardless of whether such acts were conducted offline or through cyberspace.\nIt is also possible for the AU principle on the prohibition of non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another Member State could be violated by State sponsored cyber operations that seek to use hacking operations or online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within an African State. This would apply to instances where a Member State uses hacking operations to influence the election outcome in another Member State or where a Member State uses online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption within another Member State with the objective of achieving a negative state of affairs in the targeted State. In addition, the AU principle on the prohibition of subversive activities would broadly apply to acts of subversion carried out through the cyberspace by a Member State against another Member State. For example, cyberspace can be used to spread disinformation or hate speech with the aim of creating dissension and destabilizing a Member State. Therefore, the principle of prohibition of subversive activities establishes broad positive obligations that would require a Member State to prevent its\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nterritory and resources from being used to encourage or commit acts of subversion against another Member State through cyberspace.\n## 3.2 The AU Non-aggression and Common Defence Pact⁸⁰\nThe AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact was adopted in 2005 and seeks “to put an end to conflicts of any kind within and among States in Africa in order to create conditions for socio-economic development and integration of the continent as well as the fulfilment of the aspirations of [African] peoples”.⁸¹ The Pact entered into force on 18 December 2009 after its ratification by 15 AU Member States. As of August, 2021, 44 AU Member States had signed the Pact, while 22 Member States had ratified it.⁸² To a large extent, the Pact is regarded as containing by far “the most elaborate political commitment of African States not to commit aggression against each other”.⁸³\nThe Pact elaborately defines ‘aggression’ as “the use, intentionally, and knowingly, of armed force or any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity, against the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and human security of the population of a State party to this Pact, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations or the Constitutive Act of the African Union ...”.⁸⁴ Some elements of the above definition of aggression appear to create broad scope for classifying hostile cyber operations conducted by a Member State against another Member State within the meaning of aggression. For example, the Pact does not restrict the definition of aggression to the use of ‘armed force’, but includes ‘any other hostile act’ conducted by a State or non-State actor against the ‘sovereignty’ and ‘human security’ of the population of a Member State. In modern times, hostile acts against the sovereignty of a State would include disruption of its critical information infrastructure,\n⁸⁰ See U.J.

This is because hostile acts that violate the sovereignty of a State would include attacks that target its critical information infrastructure, given the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.\nIn addition, specific acts that constitute ‘acts of aggression’ (regardless of a declaration of war) under the Pact include: the use of any weapon against the territory of a Member State; the blockade of the ports, coasts or airspace of a Member State; the action of a Member State in allowing its territory to be used by another Member State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; and technological assistance of any kind, intelligence and training to another State for use in committing acts of aggression against another Member State.⁸⁷ Thus, the above elements that exist within the definition of aggression provide broad scope for considering the Pact as a framework that applies to State cyber operations. For example, ‘any weapon’ within the context of the Pact would technically include a cyber-weapon such as malware, given that such a weapon can be used to execute an attack against critical information infrastructure located in the territory of a Member State. Also, cyberattacks can be used to conduct a blockade of Member State ports, coasts or airspace,⁸⁸ while the use of a cyber-weapon to immobilize the armed forces or marine fleets of a Member State would technically fit within the Pact’s definition of aggression. This also applies where a Member State engages in acts of cyber espionage which could be used for military aggression against another Member State or provides another Member State with technological assistance of any kind such as cyber capability to conduct aggression against another Member State. In addition, a Member State that allows its territory to be used by another Member State to conduct cyberattacks against another Member State or provides support\n⁸⁵ Art. 1 AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.\n⁸⁶ See Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact [emphasis added].\n⁸⁷ Ibid.\n⁸⁸ See C.

The Council functions as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and efficient response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa.89 The Peace and Security Council, which is responsible for implementing the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact,90 is required to periodically update the Pact so as to enhance its implementation in light of contemporary security challenges.91 While the Council has not carried out any update to reflect cyber-security challenges such as State sponsored cyber operations, recent developments appear to indicate that the Council is developing a position on State sponsored cyber operations. In May, 2019, the Council issued a Communiqué on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa. The Communiqué recognized \"the increasing vulnerability of the entire Continent to the growing threat of cyber-crimes/cyberattacks\".92 In particular, the Council expressed concerns that \"a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely\" and that \"increasing global threats to Cyber Security ... constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security\".93 In furtherance of these concerns, the Council requested the AU Commission to work in collaboration with the AU Department for Peace and Security, Member States and the Regional Economic Communities to expeditiously develop a Continental Cyber Security Strategy and to report back to\n89 See Art. 2, Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, Adopted by the 1st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union, Durban, 9 July 2002.\n90 See Art. 9 AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact.\n91 See Art. 21, ibid.\n92 See African Union, Communiqué Adopted by the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU) at its 850th meeting held on 20 May 2019 on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa.

Principle 38 of the Declaration prohibits Member States from interfering with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. In this regard, Principle 38 (1) of the Declaration states that:\nStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\nMore importantly, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration provides that:\nStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n⁹⁴ Ibid, at paragraph 13.\n⁹⁵ See Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. Adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights at its 65th Ordinary Session held from 21 October to 10 November 2019 in Banjul, the Gambia, <https: 2019.pdf=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 96=\"\" a=\"\" account=\"\" africa.=\"\" africa.=\"\" and=\"\" at=\"\" be=\"\" by=\"\" cf000000=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" d=\"\" d:=\"\" eachpr.org=\"\" file=\"\" fles=\"\" fles-englis=\"\" for=\"\" free=\"\" freeform=\"\" gambia,=\"\" in=\"\" jbid,=\"\" krtps:=\"\" knowerper09=\"\" of=\"\" on=\"\" on%20freedom%20of%20expression_eng_2019.pdf=\"\" public=\"\" public/document=\"\" public?document=\"\" rpch=\"\" se=\"\" see=\"\" state=\"\" states=\"\" the=\"\" visual=\"\" www.achpr.org=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n257\nThus, while no provisions of the Declaration specifically address State sponsored cyber operations, the above provision of Principle 38 (2) can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt access to the Internet and critical information infrastructure in another Member State. This is because the positive obligation that is established in Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration is not specifically restricted to disruption of access to the Internet or other digital technologies within a Member State's territory. Rather, the obligation relates to \"any disruption of access\" to the Internet and other digital technologies provided that it has hindered exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. Therefore, in fulfilling the positive obligation under Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration, a Member State is required to refrain from conducting cyber operations against another Member State where such operation will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure (for example, critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education).\nIn addition, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration imposes a positive obligation on Member States not to \"condone any disruption\" of Internet access or other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population. Thus, in fulfilling the above positive obligation a Member State is not only required to refrain from conducting cyber operations that will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, but the obligation further requires a Member State to condemn and refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors that conduct cyber operations to disrupt Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, including critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education.\n## 3.5 The ECOWAS\nThe founding Treaty of the ECOWAS establishes its objectives, which include: promoting regional cooperation and integration and maintaining peace, stability and security within the region.97 In pursuance of the objectives to maintain peace, stability and security within the region, the ECOWAS adopted a Protocol on Non-Aggression in 1978, which imposes obligations on Member States to refrain from using \"force or aggression\" and \"any other means inconsistent with\" the Charter of the United Nations or Constitutive Act of the AU against the territorial integrity and political independence of\n97 See Art. 58 ECOWAS Treaty.\nUCHENNA ORJI\nother Member States.⁹⁸ The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations. However, its provisions can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 2 of the Protocol requires every Member State to “refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States”.⁹⁹ The Protocol does not define the meaning of terms such as ‘subversion’, ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’, hence resort shall be had to other definitions of those terms. ‘Subversion’ simply refers to undermining the power and authority of an established system or institution or State.¹⁰⁰ ‘Hostility’ refers to hostile or unfriendly behaviour such as acts of warfare.¹⁰¹ Similarly, ‘aggression’ refers to hostile behaviour such as the act of attacking a State.¹⁰² Thus, a broad interpretation of acts of ‘subversion’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will include State sponsored cyber operations that seek to undermine the power and authority of a Member State. This, for example, will include State sponsored online disinformation campaigns that are targeted to cause disruption and chaos within another Member State. A broad interpretation of acts of ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will also include State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure located within the territory of a Member State. In addition, fulfilment of the obligation under Article 2 of the Protocol will require Member States to condemn cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure in another Member State and also to refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors in the conduct of such operations.\nArticle 3 of the Protocol further imposes obligations on Member States to prevent foreigners resident within their territories from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other Member States.¹⁰³ A broad interpretation of this obligation in the context of cyber operations implies, for example, that Member States are required to hold foreigners resident within their territories accountable where they engage in or encourage cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State. In addition, the Protocol requires every Member State to prevent “non-resident foreigners”\n98 See Art. 1 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol (1978).\n99 See Art. 2 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol.\n100 See The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (8th Edition, 2015), p. 1491.\n101 Ibid, p. 727.\n102 Ibid, p. 28.\n103 See Art. 3 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol.\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n259\nfrom using its territory as a base for conducting or encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States. Application of this obligation in the context of cyber operations would require a Member State to refrain from providing its territory as a base to “non-resident foreigners” for the purpose of conducting cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State.\n## 3.6 The SADC\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the SADC is to safeguard peace, stability and security within the SADC region. In pursuance of this objective, the SADC adopted a Mutual Defence Protocol in August, 2003. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations; however, Article 8 of the Protocol can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 8 of the Protocol provides that: “State parties undertake not to nurture, harbour or support any person, group of persons or institutions whose aim is to destabilize the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party”. Article 2 of the Protocol defines the term destabilize as:\nto instigate, plan, execute or assist in any of the following:\n(a) an armed attack against a State party;\n(b) sabotage aimed at the people of a State Party or an asset of a State party, whether inside or outside the territory of the State party; or,\n(c) any act or activity aimed at changing the constitutional order of a State Party through unconstitutional mean.¹⁰⁴\nIn light of the above definition of destabilization, a broad interpretation of Article 8 of the Protocol would require, for example, that a State Party is to refrain from nurturing, harbouring, instigating or supporting any person, group of persons or institutions that seek to carry out cyber operations with the aim of disrupting or sabotaging national critical information infrastructure with a view to destabilizing the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party. The SADC has also recognized a connection between cybersecurity and regional instability. For example, in 2004, the SADC Strategic Plan on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation recognized the need to build capacity to combat cybercrime and terrorism in\n¹⁰⁴ See Art. 2 SADC Mutual Defense Protocol (2003).\nUCHENNA ORJI\norder to protect the region against instability arising from intrastate conflicts and aggression.¹⁰⁵",
    "## 4 Identifying National Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations": "Only a few African countries have considered issues relating to cyber conflict in their laws and policies on national security and cybersecurity. In most cases, such issues have been highlighted briefly in laws and policy instruments without providing clear definitions or national doctrines. For example, in Ghana, the Cybersecurity Act provides for the establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority which will be responsible “for taking measures in response to cybersecurity incidents that occur within and outside the country which may threaten national security; the defence of the country; the economy of the country; [and] international relations between the State and other countries”. However, aside from this provision, Ghana has not established a clear national doctrine that addresses cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Malawi, the National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes the development of a cybersecurity contingency plan that will include the role of the military during cyberattacks and emergencies.¹⁰⁶ The Strategy also proposes the development of a Cyber Defence Strategy that establishes approaches to addressing national security threats in cyberspace.¹⁰⁷ The Strategy further grants the military a prominent role in the management of cybersecurity incidents. In this regard, the Strategy provides that the Malawi Defence Force in collaboration with the Malawi Computer Emergency Response Team “will continuously monitor the cyberspace sphere to identify and address cyber threats and risks to the National Security of Malawi”.¹⁰⁸ However, aside from the above declarations in Malawi’s National Cybersecurity Strategy, the country is yet to develop a clear national doctrine that addresses State sponsored cyber operations or acts of aggression in cyberspace. Similarly, in Kenya, the government prescribes a broad role for the Ministry of Defence in cybersecurity governance.\n¹⁰⁵ See SADC Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (2004), p. 38.\n¹⁰⁶ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy (2019–2024), p. 16, <https: 160=\"\" api.pppc.mw=\"\" national-cybers-col.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy, p. 29.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn this regard, the Kenyan Ministry of Defence White Paper declares that \"cyber-attacks can undermine State security. [The] Ministry of Defence in collaboration with other stakeholders must develop appropriate capacity and institute measures to safeguard information systems\". However, beyond this declaration, Kenya is yet to develop the role of the military in the management of cybersecurity threats, and the country is yet to develop a policy on cyber defence or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Morocco, the military plays a prominent role in cybersecurity governance. In this regard, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has the responsibility of overseeing the development of cybersecurity and cyber defence capabilities and for ensuring the resilience and availability of the country's military operational networks. Morocco has also developed several cyber-related capabilities; however, despite the military's role in the management of cybersecurity threats, the country is yet to develop a formalized military policy or electronic on cybersecurity.\nSouth Africa appears to be the only African country that has recognized cyber warfare concerns in its national defence policy. In this regard, South Africa's Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 recognizes that \"information warfare\" including the targeting of political institutions and processes, is a national concern. In a military context, the policy classifies South African cyberspace as a \"domain\" under \"the physical control and political authority of the South African State\". The policy also classifies cybersecurity as \"a central national priority\" and further requires the Department of Defence to develop a cyber defence capability that will enhance national cyber resilience. The policy further mandates the Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to focus on cyber defence by establishing a cyber defence capability within the SANDF. However, beyond this brief recognition of information warfare in the Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, South Africa is yet to develop clear doctrines on cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n109 See Kenya Ministry of Defense, Defense White Paper (2017), p. 14.\n110 See M.

In addition, the Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy (2014) recognizes the country’s emerging opportunities in cyberspace to include exploitation of cyberspace to advance military capability in engaging external threats and conflicts. The Policy also classifies cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage and cyber conflict as major threats to Nigeria’s national security and stability.¹¹⁷\nUnder Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014), cyberspace is recognized as the fifth domain for driving critical national functions including national security and defence operations.¹¹⁸ The Strategy classifies sources of cyber threats to include foreign States and State sponsored actors and proposes to articulate an integrated containment of cyber threats including cyber conflict, violence and terror threats against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Strategy’s principle of integrated containment seeks to articulate containment measures which focus on shared responsibilities and cooperation among all State actors at the national, regional and global levels. However, the Strategy does not develop elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations, nor does it consider application of international law to cyber operations.\nRecently, the Office of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser reviewed its National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy to reflect emerging concerns on cyber threats and national security. Following the review, both the Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy are now contained in one document known as the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021). An element of the new Policy that relates to the threat of State sponsored cyber\n¹¹⁵ See Nigeria National Security Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p. 26.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n¹¹⁷ Ibid.\n¹¹⁸ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p.8, <https: cypersecurity=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" national_strategies_repository=\"\" natoria_2014_national_cybersecurity_strategy.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\noperations is the issue of foreign interference in elections. In this regard, the Policy recognizes that State and non-State actors have the potential to exert leverage on cyberspace to interfere with the electoral process including interference with elections' critical infrastructure and the conduct of cyber operations to disrupt or influence the electorate.^^ Another relevant element of the Policy is that it seeks to mainstream voluntary non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace through international awareness and engagement.^^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to adopt voluntary non-binding norms that promote responsible State behaviour and also participate in ongoing international dialogue on cyber norms. The Policy also seeks to enhance Nigeria's cyber defence capability by investing in the military to identify, prevent and repel any cyber threats to Nigeria's sovereignty and national security.^^\nThe Policy further proposes establishment of a Defence Space Administration that will coordinate the cyber activities of armed forces in defending Nigeria against cyberattacks.^^ The Defence Space Administration is meant to work with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre to develop a national cyber defence plan for Nigeria. More importantly, the proposed National Cyber Defence Plan is meant to address cross-border cyberattacks while also \"embracing requisite restraints obligated under international law\".^^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to comply with existing international law when conducting cyber operations. Thus, given that Nigeria has not earlier stated the need for an international regime to regulate States in the conduct of cyber operations, it can therefore be argued to a large extent that the Policy's recognition of \"requisite restraints obligated under international law\" appears to indicate Nigeria's position on the applicability of existing international law to cyber operations conducted by States. Therefore, it can be argued that Nigeria supports the view of the United States and Western countries that existing international law applies to cyber operations.\nHowever, pending establishment of the National Cyber Defence Plan proposed in the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), the Policy in its present form does not establish elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber\n^^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abuja, 2021), pp. 5–6.\n^^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), p. 14.\n^^ Ibid., p. 14.\n^^ Ibid., pp. 41–42.\n^^ Ibid., p. 42.\nUCHENNA ORJI\naggression or State sponsored cyber operations. Despite the absence of such doctrines, the Nigerian Army established a Cyber Warfare Command in 2018.¹²⁴ According to the Nigerian Army, the Cyber Warfare Command will be responsible for monitoring, defending and attacking subversive elements in cyberspace.¹²⁵ In 2020, the Nigerian Army Cyber Warfare Command launched its first cyber warfare exercise, which was described as Africa's first-ever cyber warfare exercise.¹²⁶ The exercise, according to the Nigerian Army, was designed to identify, track, and counter negative propaganda in social media and cyberspace.¹²⁷ However, the exercise raised human rights concerns given that it was launched during the nationwide campaign against police brutality known as the #ENDSARS campaign.¹²⁸ These concerns were further heightened by the exercise's objectives which appear to lend some credence to the view that the exercise sought to stifle online dissent during the #ENDSARS campaign.",
    "## 5 Challenges in Identifying African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations": "To a large extent, African States and regional organizations have been absent from the ongoing international debate on norms for the governance of State behaviour in cyberspace.

Thus, currently, many African States lack awareness about State sponsored cyber operations and the applicability of international law and this appears to reflect in their lack of policy and legal responses to issues in that regard. For example, no African State or regional organization has developed a robust regime on State sponsored cyber operations. Also no African State has clearly stated its position on the applicability of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations. This creates challenges in clearly identifying the position of African States on State sponsored cyber operations and therefore creates a situation where a broad interpretation of existing regimes has to be undertaken in order to attempt an identification of African positions. Also, to some extent, it may be argued that the mere participation of many African States in UNGGE processes may not really result in the easy identification of their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations if those States still lack robust cyber capabilities and basic capacities on cybersecurity governance. As such, in the absence of robust national cyber capabilities and basic cybersecurity governance capacities, the awareness that will be derived by African States following their participation in international cyber norms processes may produce little or no effect in terms of identifying their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nAnother challenge is that many African countries are still in the primary stages of tackling cybercrime and are in the process of establishing cybercrime laws, policies, and institutional frameworks. For example, as of 2021, many African countries did not have cybercrime laws, cybersecurity strategies or national Computer Emergency Response Teams.¹³⁰ There is also a lack of awareness amongst policy makers on issues relating to State sponsored cyber operations. For example, lack of awareness amongst policy makers in some countries has resulted in poor interest in funding training for cybersecurity skills due to fears over the dual use of such skills. In 2016, it was reported that\n¹²⁹ See E. Calandro and N.

Lack of awareness and funding is also caused by the fact that cybersecurity issues including the threat of State sponsored cyber operations is not really considered as a national security priority in many African States.¹³² This is also not unconnected with the fact that many African States face physical national security challenges such as terrorism which policy makers usually consider more pervasive than cybersecurity challenges.¹³³",

Nevertheless, as discussed in this chapter, there exist some African regional and national legal and policy instruments that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. A broad interpretation of these legal and policy instruments in the light of the challenges of the information society, such as State sponsored cyber operations, can be used as a guide in locating probable African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. In particular, the AU Non-Aggression Pact can be broadly interpreted as constituting the common position of African countries towards State sponsored cyber operations. However, the AU Peace and Security Council in the exercise of its mandate should consider making updates to the Pact so as to clearly reflect cyber operations. In the present state of affairs in Africa, and the challenges of identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations, the question will remain largely unanswered for some time as to whether the positions of African States on the application of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations largely aligns with either the United States and Europe or with Russia and China. Thus, in the circumstances, it appears safer to conclude that most African States are still developing basic capabilities and are not yet aligned with either the views of the United States and Europe or with Russia and China towards State sponsored cyber operations."

As such, there are growing concerns that State sponsored cyber operations can harm the critical infrastructure and information systems of other States. In Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. However, to a large extent the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. However, an inquiry has not been undertaken to identify emerging African positions on international law and State sponsored cyber operations. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to inquire into emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations within the context of international law. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter will further consider challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n* Asst.

However, the integration of computer and digital communications technologies into all aspects of life has redefined traditional notions of security. Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”. Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations. Thus, cyberspace has extended the battlefield and is viewed as the fifth battle space alongside the more traditional domains such as land, air, sea and space.\nIn furtherance of the above view, some States and international military organizations have developed defence doctrines which recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. For example, in 1999, the United States Department of Defense Report on the Legal Issues of Information Operations observed that there is “an obvious military interest in being able to interfere with an adversary’s information systems, and in being able to protect one’s own”. In 2010, the United States Department of Defense recognized cyberspace as a\n1. See M.

The United States Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace which was launched in July, 2011 recognizes that cyberspace, despite being a man-made domain, “is now a relevant domain for DoD activities as the naturally occurring domains of land, sea, air, and space”. Accordingly, the United States DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace declares that “the DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace’s potential”. In 2011, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the United Kingdom recognized that “cyberspace has now grown to become a domain where strategic advantage – industrial or military – can be won or lost”.\nSimilarly, in 2011, the Russian Federation Armed Forces’ Information Space Activities Concept recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations. The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept appears to largely classify cyberspace with the term “information space”. It defines “Military conflict in the information space” as “a form of interstate or intra-state conflicts with the use of information weapons”. The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept also defines “Information War” as:\nthe confrontation between two or more states in the information space with the purpose of inflicting damage to information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining the political, economic and social systems, a massive psychological manipulation of the population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force.\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2016, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) during its Warsaw Summit recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. In this regard, the NATO Cyber Pledge which was adopted at the Summit pledges to ensure that Member States are “capable of defending themselves in cyberspace as in the air, on land and at sea”. Therefore, cyberattacks with demonstrated aggressive intentions can trigger the collective security mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.\nWith the recognition of cyberspace as a domain of warfare, there have been growing concerns over the potential of State cyber operations to endanger international peace and security. This has prompted several calls to promote stability in cyberspace through the establishment of norms and legal regimes that promote responsible behaviour by States in cyberspace. Such calls led\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nthe United Nations (UN) to convene a Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States” and also to propose measures to address them. The UNGGE addressed issues relating to cyber operations by States and recommended that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law which intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public. This recommendation is, however, not legally binding on States, but rather provides a framework of international best practices that States should consider with a view to promoting cyber stability.\nIn Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa, however, appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. This chapter seeks to identify emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter further considers challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nThe chapter is divided into five sections. The first section is this introduction. The second section discusses the concept of State Sponsored Cyber Operations and Cyber Stability and also considers international law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations. It addresses the threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations in Africa. The third section identifies African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations by considering the provisions of African regional instruments such as the African Union Constitutive Act, African Union Declarations, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the African Union Non-Aggression Pact, the ECOWAS Protocol on Non-Aggression, and the SADC\n See UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174 (22 July 2015), 8 at paragraph 13(f).\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 2 State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nIn simple terms, State sponsored cyber operations refer to cyberattacks that are conducted by a State to disrupt or exploit the computer systems of a targeted State or cause harm to the computer systems and critical infrastructure of the targeted State with the objective of gaining an advantage over the targeted State. Such attacks may be conducted directly by a State through its institutions or through a non-State proxy with the support of a State. Targets of State sponsored cyber operations are usually critical infrastructure. However, all forms of computing devices connected to information networks are also potential targets of State sponsored cyber operations.\nState sponsored cyber operations can be executed through malicious cyber activities such as: the deployment of viruses, computer worms and malware that can disrupt and harm critical infrastructure; the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices; the use of hacking to steal critical data from institutions, governments and businesses; the use of ransomware to hold critical computer systems hostage; the use of cyber espionage to access national security information; and the use of online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within a country.\nA distinctive feature of State sponsored cyber operations is that they are generally cheaper than traditional military operations and can be carried out even by small States that may lack the technological capacities to carry out attacks. Such States can compensate for their disadvantage by hiring proxies. Therefore, at comparatively low risk and cost, significant damage and disruption can be inflicted on the intended target with little fear of reprisal given the challenges of attributing attacks to a particular individual or entity in cyberspace. Due to the challenge of attribution, State actors, criminal actors or non-State actors can loop through different computer systems in the process of perpetrating cyberattacks or even orchestrate attacks to appear to originate from government computers in another country. Thus, the problem of\nUCHENNA ORJI\nattribution creates uncertainty in identifying the origin of cyberattacks or the motive behind such attacks. As such, the nature of cyberspace gives disproportionate power to small and relatively insignificant malicious actors who can easily target foreign countries with a high degree of anonymity.\nSeveral reported cyber incidents have been classified as State sponsored cyber operations. For example, in May, 2007, Estonia experienced a series of massive and coordinated cyberattacks which targeted the country's public and private critical information infrastructure. The attacks deployed botnets of one over million computers located in over 50 countries around the world and the incident – classified as the world's first cyber war – is linked to Russia. In 2008, during the brief Russian-Georgia conflict, Georgia alleged that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against its government. Similar attacks were also launched against Georgia in 2019. The 2010 Stuxnet attack which targeted and destroyed Iran's nuclear centrifuges was reported to be a joint cyber operation between the United States and Israel code-named Olympic Games. In 2015, it was alleged that Russia had launched cyberattacks against Ukraine.\n See U.J.

Another definition refers to ‘cyber stability’ as “a geostrategic condition whereby users of the cyber domain enjoy the greatest possible benefits to political, civic, social, and economic life, while preventing and managing conduct that may undermine those benefits at the national, regional, and international levels”. It has been observed that this definition creates a basis from which to identify when stability is the goal and also to discern what is potentially relevant, useful, and strategic information about activity in the cyber domain from what is not. Cyber stability has also been defined as referring to “a state of relations between States characterized by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the States have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits”. The Report on a\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nFramework for International Cyber Stability, which was commissioned by the United States, defines cyber stability as “an environment where all participants, including nation-States, non-governmental organizations, commercial enterprises, and individuals, can positively and dependably enjoy the benefits of cyberspace; where there are benefits to cooperation and to avoidance of conflict, and where there are disincentives for these actors to engage in malicious cyber activity”.32\nA common thread that appears to run through the above definitions of cyber stability is that the concept aims to prevent conflict or hostilities in cyberspace. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability is used to classify measures that aim to prevent or minimize conflict between actors, including States, in cyberspace. As such, the concept aims to minimize threats and conduct that can escalate tensions between States in cyberspace. However, despite the above definitions of cyber stability, the concept is to a large extent regarded as an emerging concept that has not yet been developed as an analytic category.33\nAttempts have also been made to define an African view of cyber stability that is distinguishable from the global view.34 In this regard, it has been argued that in many ways the global views of cyber stability in dominant literature do not apply to African States and that the dominant views of cyber stability which promote regulatory openness, interoperability and global integration have been argued as differing from the views of African countries, which consider that global integration can bring instability through dependence.35 This argument may hold to the extent that many African States promote the idea of national self-sufficiency and independence in the development of information communications infrastructure so as to prevent digital colonialism and dependence on technologically advanced countries.36 However, that argument does not hold in the context of promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, because African States have taken steps to establish\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nregional and national measures to promote cybersecurity governance in compliance with global standards. For example, African States have established regional treaties to promote cybersecurity governance such as the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Directive on Fighting Cybercrime, which both require Member States to establish legal measures to criminalize and control cybercrimes and also establish frameworks for international cooperation on cybercrime. In addition, some African States are parties to international treaties such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime through which they participate in the Convention's extensive international cooperation framework and provide or receive mutual assistance from Western and non-Western countries that are parties to the Convention. These African developments tend towards regional and global integration in cybersecurity governance arrangements and challenge the argument that African States consider that global integration can bring instability through dependency.\nIn more practical terms, the concept of cyber stability aims to promote responsible State behaviour with a view to addressing the security challenges of the information society. This for example requires States to establish appropriate legal, policy and regulatory measures to protect cyber users and cyber infrastructure within their jurisdiction, and also ensure that cyber activities which are conducted within their jurisdiction do not cause harm to other individuals or infrastructure in another jurisdiction. The need to promote cyber stability arises from the increasing interconnectedness of national information communication networks in different countries. This has ushered in a new age of network interdependence where the security of each country's network is\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nalso dependent on the actions of State and non-State actors around the world. Thus, in this state of network interdependence, malicious cyber activities can have trans-boundary effects. Hence, malicious cyber activities which are conducted in a particular State can harm individuals or infrastructure located in another State. This also has potential to affect relations between States in a manner that can endanger international peace and security. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability requires States to maintain governance responsibility over cyber activities on their territory and refrain from cyber activities that can cause harm to persons or infrastructure in other States.\nThe concept of cyber stability enshrines elements of the international principles of trans-boundary harm and State responsibility. These principles were recognized in different contexts in the Corfu Channel Case, where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that a State may not \"allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\",[42] and in the Trail Smelter Case, where it was held that \"no State has right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein\".[43] These principles also exist in international telecommunications law. For example, Article 38.5 of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) requires Member States not to cause harm to the operation of telecommunications in other States. Thus, it declares that \"Member States recognize the necessity of taking practical measures to prevent the operation of electrical apparatus and installations of all kinds from disrupting the operation of telecommunication installations within the jurisdiction of other Member States\".[44]\n## 2.2 International Law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nCalls for norms and legal regimes to govern the conduct of States with respect to cyber activities that can endanger international peace and security $^{45}$ have sought to promote cyber stability by proposing the establishment of rules to ensure responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. $^{46}$ Such calls have led to\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nthe establishment of international initiatives to promote cyber stability. In this regard, issues concerning international cyber stability were first placed on the agenda of the UN by the Russian Federation in 1998 when it proposed UN General Assembly Resolution 53/70 on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was adopted without vote on 4 December, 1998 following a recommendation of the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security. Since then, that Resolution has been repeated annually. In particular, the Resolution noted the need to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, and expressed concerns that information technologies “can potentially be used for purposes that are consistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States”. Subsequently, between 2004 and 2017, the United Nations convened the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs [information and communication technologies] by States” and also propose measures to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence building measures.\nIn particular, the third UN GGE made several landmark conclusions, including that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\ncontrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public.53 It also concluded that “international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”.54 Other significant conclusions that were reached by the third UN GGE include that:\n(a) State sovereignty and international norms and principles which flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory;55\n(b) States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts and must also ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs, and that States must meet their obligations for internationally wrongful acts attributable to them.56\nHowever, while the UN GGE’s reports are not legally binding, their recommendations carry significant influence in shaping global cyber-security governance, as they can provide a basis for developing rules to promote responsible cyber conduct by States.\nAlso between 2009 and 2012, the Tallinn based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre convened an international group of distinguished international law academics to study how international law applies to cyber operations conducted by States.57 The study resulted in the publication of an academic and non-binding treatise known as the Tallinn Manual in 201358 with a second edition in 2017.59 The Manual generally advances the position that principles of existing international law apply to cyber operations without the need for new international legal regimes. However, while the United States and many Western countries support the view that existing international law applies to cyber operations without the need for new international\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 2.3 Africa and the Threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrica comprises 55 sovereign States and is classified as the world's second largest and second most populous continent after Asia, with a terrestrial mass of 30, 2044,049 million square kilometres and a human population of over one billion people. The continent has five geographical sub-regions, comprising: Southern Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, and West Africa. The African Union (AU) is the most prominent regional intergovernmental organization that unites African States and it comprises 55 sovereign States. Other notable intergovernmental organizations that operate within Africa's sub-regions include: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) which comprises 19 Member States, the Economic Community of West African West States (ECOWAS) which comprises 15 Member States, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) which comprises 16 Member States and the East African Community (EAC) which comprises six States.\nThe increasing penetration of ICTs in Africa has been followed with their growing integration in critical national sectors. For example, banking and financial services sectors in African States are increasingly integrating ICTs to enhance service delivery and improve consumer satisfaction. Also, across\n See E.

For example, in January, 2018, China denied that the computer network equipment it had supplied to the AU allowed it to access confidential information from the AU.73 In June 2020, following a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam being built on the Nile River, it was reported that Egyptian hackers had launched cyberattacks on a number of Ethiopian websites.74 In December, 2020, it was reported that Chinese hackers had been accessing the security footage from cameras installed at the AU headquarters.

For example, in 2011, the ECOWAS adopted a Directive to fight cybercrime within the ECOWAS region.76 Also in 2011, COMESA developed a Model Cybercrime Bill with a view to providing a uniform framework that would serve as a guide for the development of cybercrime laws in Member States.77 In 2012, the SADC adopted a Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime to serve as a guide for the development of cybersecurity laws in SADC Member States.78 In 2014, the AU adopted the Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection to harmonize the laws of African States on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control.79 To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa has been on curbing cybercrime and it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace by African States. However, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n## 3 Identifying African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrican regional organizations have legal instruments on cybersecurity such as the ECOWAS Directive on Cybercrime, the COMESA Model Cybercrime Bill, the SADC Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime, the AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Cybersecurity Strategy. However, these instruments only focus on cybersecurity governance and cybercrime control and have not explicitly addressed State sponsored\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\noperations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional instruments and declarations that could indicate emerging positions on State sponsored cyber operations. Such instruments and declarations exist within the framework of African regional organizations such as the AU, the ECOWAS, and the SADC and will now be discussed.\n## 3.1 The Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU)\nThe Constitutive Act sets down the Objectives of the Union, which include inter alia to: \"promote peace, security, and stability on the continent\". In furtherance of its objectives, the AU establishes a range of governing principles which include: the establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent; a prohibition of the use of force or threat to use force among Member States of the Union; non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another; the right of Member States to live and coexist in peace and security; and rejection of acts of impunity, acts of terrorism and subversive activities. These principles in the AU Constitutive Act do not expressly mention cyber stability; however, they can be broadly interpreted as accommodating recent developments that affect cyber stability. For example, acts that affect the peace, security and stability of African States in contemporary times include State sponsored cyber operations that target critical national infrastructure and data. As such, the above principles of the AU Constitutive Act impose broad positive obligations on Member States to refrain from engaging in acts that will affect the peace, security and stability of Africa regardless of whether such acts were conducted offline or through cyberspace.\nIt is also possible for the AU principle on the prohibition of non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another Member State could be violated by State sponsored cyber operations that seek to use hacking operations or online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within an African State. This would apply to instances where a Member State uses hacking operations to influence the election outcome in another Member State or where a Member State uses online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption within another Member State with the objective of achieving a negative state of affairs in the targeted State. In addition, the AU principle on the prohibition of subversive activities would broadly apply to acts of subversion carried out through the cyberspace by a Member State against another Member State. For example, cyberspace can be used to spread disinformation or hate speech with the aim of creating dissension and destabilizing a Member State. Therefore, the principle of prohibition of subversive activities establishes broad positive obligations that would require a Member State to prevent its\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nterritory and resources from being used to encourage or commit acts of subversion against another Member State through cyberspace.\n## 3.2 The AU Non-aggression and Common Defence Pact\nThe AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact was adopted in 2005 and seeks “to put an end to conflicts of any kind within and among States in Africa in order to create conditions for socio-economic development and integration of the continent as well as the fulfilment of the aspirations of [African] peoples”. The Pact entered into force on 18 December 2009 after its ratification by 15 AU Member States. As of August, 2021, 44 AU Member States had signed the Pact, while 22 Member States had ratified it. To a large extent, the Pact is regarded as containing by far “the most elaborate political commitment of African States not to commit aggression against each other”.\nThe Pact elaborately defines ‘aggression’ as “the use, intentionally, and knowingly, of armed force or any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity, against the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and human security of the population of a State party to this Pact, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations or the Constitutive Act of the African Union ...”. Some elements of the above definition of aggression appear to create broad scope for classifying hostile cyber operations conducted by a Member State against another Member State within the meaning of aggression. For example, the Pact does not restrict the definition of aggression to the use of ‘armed force’, but includes ‘any other hostile act’ conducted by a State or non-State actor against the ‘sovereignty’ and ‘human security’ of the population of a Member State. In modern times, hostile acts against the sovereignty of a State would include disruption of its critical information infrastructure,\n See U.J. Orji, ‘Rethinking the African Union Non-Aggression Treaty as a Framework for Promoting Responsible in Cyberspace’, Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public &amp; International Law (MPII) Research Paper Series, No. 2021–24, (September, 2021), pp.7–20, <https: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"3930007\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n See Preamble to the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact (2005).\n See The Status List: AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact, (January, 2020) <https: africa-union-non-aggression-and-common-defence-pact=\"\" en=\"\" au.int=\"\" treaties=\"\" treaties@africa-union-non-aggression-and-common-defence-pact=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n See Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression, Preventing Aggression in the African Context, <https: 8=\"\" documents=\"\" crimeofaggression.info=\"\" bots_aggression_in_africa.pdf=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact (Emphasis added).</https:></https:></https:>\nUCHENNA ORJI\ngiven the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security. As such, under the Pact, there is scope for classifying a Member State's cyber operations that disrupts another Member State's critical information infrastructure as a hostile act that fits into the definition of aggression under the Pact.\nThe Pact's broad definition of aggression as including “... any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity ...” also provides a basis for considering application of the Pact as an African framework for regulating State cyber operations. This is because hostile acts that violate the sovereignty of a State would include attacks that target its critical information infrastructure, given the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.\nIn addition, specific acts that constitute ‘acts of aggression’ (regardless of a declaration of war) under the Pact include: the use of any weapon against the territory of a Member State; the blockade of the ports, coasts or airspace of a Member State; the action of a Member State in allowing its territory to be used by another Member State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; and technological assistance of any kind, intelligence and training to another State for use in committing acts of aggression against another Member State. Thus, the above elements that exist within the definition of aggression provide broad scope for considering the Pact as a framework that applies to State cyber operations. For example, ‘any weapon’ within the context of the Pact would technically include a cyber-weapon such as malware, given that such a weapon can be used to execute an attack against critical information infrastructure located in the territory of a Member State. Also, cyberattacks can be used to conduct a blockade of Member State ports, coasts or airspace, while the use of a cyber-weapon to immobilize the armed forces or marine fleets of a Member State would technically fit within the Pact’s definition of aggression. This also applies where a Member State engages in acts of cyber espionage which could be used for military aggression against another Member State or provides another Member State with technological assistance of any kind such as cyber capability to conduct aggression against another Member State. In addition, a Member State that allows its territory to be used by another Member State to conduct cyberattacks against another Member State or provides support\n Art. 1 AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.\n See Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact [emphasis added].\n Ibid.\n See C.

The Council functions as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and efficient response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa.89 The Peace and Security Council, which is responsible for implementing the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact,90 is required to periodically update the Pact so as to enhance its implementation in light of contemporary security challenges.91 While the Council has not carried out any update to reflect cyber-security challenges such as State sponsored cyber operations, recent developments appear to indicate that the Council is developing a position on State sponsored cyber operations. In May, 2019, the Council issued a Communiqué on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa. The Communiqué recognized \"the increasing vulnerability of the entire Continent to the growing threat of cyber-crimes/cyberattacks\".92 In particular, the Council expressed concerns that \"a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely\" and that \"increasing global threats to Cyber Security ... constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security\".93 In furtherance of these concerns, the Council requested the AU Commission to work in collaboration with the AU Department for Peace and Security, Member States and the Regional Economic Communities to expeditiously develop a Continental Cyber Security Strategy and to report back to\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nthe Council before the 2020 Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government. However, while to some extent the above statements indicate the Council's emerging position on State cyber operations, the proposed AU Continental Cyber Security Strategy is yet to be developed to clearly express the AU's position on State cyber operations.\n## 3.4 Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa\nIn November 2019, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights adopted the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. The Declaration was adopted pursuant to Article 45(1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, which mandates the African Commission to promote human and peoples' rights by formulating principles and rules to address legal problems relating to human and peoples' rights and fundamental freedoms upon which African States may base their legislation. The Declaration affirms the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and access to information enshrined in Article 9 of the African Charter. Principle 38 of the Declaration prohibits Member States from interfering with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. In this regard, Principle 38 (1) of the Declaration states that:\nStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\nMore importantly, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration provides that:\nStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n Ibid, at paragraph 13.\n See Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. Adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights at its 65th Ordinary Session held from 21 October to 10 November 2019 in Banjul, the Gambia, <https: 2019.pdf=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 96=\"\" a=\"\" account=\"\" africa.=\"\" africa.=\"\" and=\"\" at=\"\" be=\"\" by=\"\" cf000000=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" d=\"\" d:=\"\" eachpr.org=\"\" file=\"\" fles=\"\" fles-englis=\"\" for=\"\" free=\"\" freeform=\"\" gambia,=\"\" in=\"\" jbid,=\"\" krtps:=\"\" knowerper09=\"\" of=\"\" on=\"\" on%20freedom%20of%20expression_eng_2019.pdf=\"\" public=\"\" public/document=\"\" public?document=\"\" rpch=\"\" se=\"\" see=\"\" state=\"\" states=\"\" the=\"\" visual=\"\" www.achpr.org=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nIn addition, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration imposes a positive obligation on Member States not to \"condone any disruption\" of Internet access or other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population. Thus, in fulfilling the above positive obligation a Member State is not only required to refrain from conducting cyber operations that will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, but the obligation further requires a Member State to condemn and refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors that conduct cyber operations to disrupt Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, including critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education.\n## 3.5 The ECOWAS\nThe founding Treaty of the ECOWAS establishes its objectives, which include: promoting regional cooperation and integration and maintaining peace, stability and security within the region.97 In pursuance of the objectives to maintain peace, stability and security within the region, the ECOWAS adopted a Protocol on Non-Aggression in 1978, which imposes obligations on Member States to refrain from using \"force or aggression\" and \"any other means inconsistent with\" the Charter of the United Nations or Constitutive Act of the AU against the territorial integrity and political independence of\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nother Member States. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations. However, its provisions can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 2 of the Protocol requires every Member State to “refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States”. The Protocol does not define the meaning of terms such as ‘subversion’, ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’, hence resort shall be had to other definitions of those terms. ‘Subversion’ simply refers to undermining the power and authority of an established system or institution or State. ‘Hostility’ refers to hostile or unfriendly behaviour such as acts of warfare. Similarly, ‘aggression’ refers to hostile behaviour such as the act of attacking a State. Thus, a broad interpretation of acts of ‘subversion’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will include State sponsored cyber operations that seek to undermine the power and authority of a Member State. This, for example, will include State sponsored online disinformation campaigns that are targeted to cause disruption and chaos within another Member State. A broad interpretation of acts of ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will also include State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure located within the territory of a Member State. In addition, fulfilment of the obligation under Article 2 of the Protocol will require Member States to condemn cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure in another Member State and also to refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors in the conduct of such operations.\nArticle 3 of the Protocol further imposes obligations on Member States to prevent foreigners resident within their territories from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other Member States. A broad interpretation of this obligation in the context of cyber operations implies, for example, that Member States are required to hold foreigners resident within their territories accountable where they engage in or encourage cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State. In addition, the Protocol requires every Member State to prevent “non-resident foreigners”\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 3.6 The SADC\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the SADC is to safeguard peace, stability and security within the SADC region. In pursuance of this objective, the SADC adopted a Mutual Defence Protocol in August, 2003. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations; however, Article 8 of the Protocol can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 8 of the Protocol provides that: “State parties undertake not to nurture, harbour or support any person, group of persons or institutions whose aim is to destabilize the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party”. Article 2 of the Protocol defines the term destabilize as:\nto instigate, plan, execute or assist in any of the following:\n(a) an armed attack against a State party;\n(b) sabotage aimed at the people of a State Party or an asset of a State party, whether inside or outside the territory of the State party; or,\n(c) any act or activity aimed at changing the constitutional order of a State Party through unconstitutional mean.\nIn light of the above definition of destabilization, a broad interpretation of Article 8 of the Protocol would require, for example, that a State Party is to refrain from nurturing, harbouring, instigating or supporting any person, group of persons or institutions that seek to carry out cyber operations with the aim of disrupting or sabotaging national critical information infrastructure with a view to destabilizing the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party. The SADC has also recognized a connection between cybersecurity and regional instability. For example, in 2004, the SADC Strategic Plan on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation recognized the need to build capacity to combat cybercrime and terrorism in\n See Art. 2 SADC Mutual Defense Protocol (2003).\nUCHENNA ORJI\norder to protect the region against instability arising from intrastate conflicts and aggression.\n## 4 Identifying National Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nOnly a few African countries have considered issues relating to cyber conflict in their laws and policies on national security and cybersecurity. In most cases, such issues have been highlighted briefly in laws and policy instruments without providing clear definitions or national doctrines. For example, in Ghana, the Cybersecurity Act provides for the establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority which will be responsible “for taking measures in response to cybersecurity incidents that occur within and outside the country which may threaten national security; the defence of the country; the economy of the country; [and] international relations between the State and other countries”. However, aside from this provision, Ghana has not established a clear national doctrine that addresses cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Malawi, the National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes the development of a cybersecurity contingency plan that will include the role of the military during cyberattacks and emergencies. The Strategy also proposes the development of a Cyber Defence Strategy that establishes approaches to addressing national security threats in cyberspace. The Strategy further grants the military a prominent role in the management of cybersecurity incidents. In this regard, the Strategy provides that the Malawi Defence Force in collaboration with the Malawi Computer Emergency Response Team “will continuously monitor the cyberspace sphere to identify and address cyber threats and risks to the National Security of Malawi”. However, aside from the above declarations in Malawi’s National Cybersecurity Strategy, the country is yet to develop a clear national doctrine that addresses State sponsored cyber operations or acts of aggression in cyberspace. Similarly, in Kenya, the government prescribes a broad role for the Ministry of Defence in cybersecurity governance.\n See SADC Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (2004), p. 38.\n See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy (2019–2024), p. 16, <https: 160=\"\" api.pppc.mw=\"\" national-cybers-col.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n Ibid.\n See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy, p. 29.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn this regard, the Kenyan Ministry of Defence White Paper declares that \"cyber-attacks can undermine State security. [The] Ministry of Defence in collaboration with other stakeholders must develop appropriate capacity and institute measures to safeguard information systems\".[109] However, beyond this declaration, Kenya is yet to develop the role of the military in the management of cybersecurity threats, and the country is yet to develop a policy on cyber defence or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Morocco, the military plays a prominent role in cybersecurity governance. In this regard, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has the responsibility of overseeing the development of cybersecurity and cyber defence capabilities and for ensuring the resilience and availability of the country's military operational networks.[110] Morocco has also developed several cyber-related capabilities; however, despite the military's role in the management of cybersecurity threats, the country is yet to develop a formalized military policy or electronic on cybersecurity.[111]\nSouth Africa appears to be the only African country that has recognized cyber warfare concerns in its national defence policy. In this regard, South Africa's Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 recognizes that \"information warfare\" including the targeting of political institutions and processes, is a national concern.[112] In a military context, the policy classifies South African cyberspace as a \"domain\" under \"the physical control and political authority of the South African State\".[113] The policy also classifies cybersecurity as \"a central national priority\" and further requires the Department of Defence to develop a cyber defence capability that will enhance national cyber resilience.[114] The policy further mandates the Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to focus on cyber defence by establishing a cyber defence capability within the SANDF. However, beyond this brief recognition of information warfare in the Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, South Africa is yet to develop clear doctrines on cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nIn Nigeria, the National Security Strategy recognizes that “cyber threats are inherently asymmetrical with an increasing range of actors engaged in espionage and warfare”. The Strategy also classifies four major cyber threats with significant capability to damage Nigeria’s national security and economy to include: cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and “cyber conflict”. The Strategy further proposes development of a national strategic framework dedicated to cyber defence including capacity building programmes for the military. In addition, the Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy (2014) recognizes the country’s emerging opportunities in cyberspace to include exploitation of cyberspace to advance military capability in engaging external threats and conflicts. The Policy also classifies cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage and cyber conflict as major threats to Nigeria’s national security and stability.\nUnder Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014), cyberspace is recognized as the fifth domain for driving critical national functions including national security and defence operations. The Strategy classifies sources of cyber threats to include foreign States and State sponsored actors and proposes to articulate an integrated containment of cyber threats including cyber conflict, violence and terror threats against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Strategy’s principle of integrated containment seeks to articulate containment measures which focus on shared responsibilities and cooperation among all State actors at the national, regional and global levels. However, the Strategy does not develop elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations, nor does it consider application of international law to cyber operations.\nRecently, the Office of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser reviewed its National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy to reflect emerging concerns on cyber threats and national security. Following the review, both the Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy are now contained in one document known as the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021). An element of the new Policy that relates to the threat of State sponsored cyber\n See Nigeria National Security Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p. 26.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p.8, <https: cypersecurity=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" national_strategies_repository=\"\" natoria_2014_national_cybersecurity_strategy.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\noperations is the issue of foreign interference in elections. In this regard, the Policy recognizes that State and non-State actors have the potential to exert leverage on cyberspace to interfere with the electoral process including interference with elections' critical infrastructure and the conduct of cyber operations to disrupt or influence the electorate.^[119]^ Another relevant element of the Policy is that it seeks to mainstream voluntary non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace through international awareness and engagement.^[120]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to adopt voluntary non-binding norms that promote responsible State behaviour and also participate in ongoing international dialogue on cyber norms. The Policy also seeks to enhance Nigeria's cyber defence capability by investing in the military to identify, prevent and repel any cyber threats to Nigeria's sovereignty and national security.^[121]^\nThe Policy further proposes establishment of a Defence Space Administration that will coordinate the cyber activities of armed forces in defending Nigeria against cyberattacks.^[122]^ The Defence Space Administration is meant to work with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre to develop a national cyber defence plan for Nigeria. More importantly, the proposed National Cyber Defence Plan is meant to address cross-border cyberattacks while also \"embracing requisite restraints obligated under international law\".^[123]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to comply with existing international law when conducting cyber operations. Thus, given that Nigeria has not earlier stated the need for an international regime to regulate States in the conduct of cyber operations, it can therefore be argued to a large extent that the Policy's recognition of \"requisite restraints obligated under international law\" appears to indicate Nigeria's position on the applicability of existing international law to cyber operations conducted by States. Therefore, it can be argued that Nigeria supports the view of the United States and Western countries that existing international law applies to cyber operations.\nHowever, pending establishment of the National Cyber Defence Plan proposed in the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), the Policy in its present form does not establish elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber\n^[119]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abuja, 2021), pp. 5–6.\n^[120]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), p. 14.\n^[121]^ Ibid., p. 14.\n^[122]^ Ibid., pp. 41–42.\n^[123]^ Ibid., p. 42.\nUCHENNA ORJI\naggression or State sponsored cyber operations. Despite the absence of such doctrines, the Nigerian Army established a Cyber Warfare Command in 2018. According to the Nigerian Army, the Cyber Warfare Command will be responsible for monitoring, defending and attacking subversive elements in cyberspace. In 2020, the Nigerian Army Cyber Warfare Command launched its first cyber warfare exercise, which was described as Africa's first-ever cyber warfare exercise. The exercise, according to the Nigerian Army, was designed to identify, track, and counter negative propaganda in social media and cyberspace. However, the exercise raised human rights concerns given that it was launched during the nationwide campaign against police brutality known as the #ENDSARS campaign. These concerns were further heightened by the exercise's objectives which appear to lend some credence to the view that the exercise sought to stifle online dissent during the #ENDSARS campaign.\n## 5 Challenges in Identifying African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nTo a large extent, African States and regional organizations have been absent from the ongoing international debate on norms for the governance of State behaviour in cyberspace. For example, since the commencement of the UNGGE process in 2004, only nine African countries have held its membership and such membership has been for a duration of not more than five\n See K. Omonobi, 'Nigerian Army's Cyber Warfare Command begins operation', *Vanguard* (29 August 2018), <https: 08=\"\" 2018=\"\" nigerian-army-cyber-warfare-command-begins-operation=\"\" www.vanguardngr.com=\"\"></https:>, visited on 15 February 2022.\n *Ibid.*\n See A.

The absence of many African States and regional organizations in the UNGGE process apparently has an effect on their levels of awareness of State sponsored cyber operations and the application of international law in that context. Thus, currently, many African States lack awareness about State sponsored cyber operations and the applicability of international law and this appears to reflect in their lack of policy and legal responses to issues in that regard. For example, no African State or regional organization has developed a robust regime on State sponsored cyber operations. Also no African State has clearly stated its position on the applicability of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations. This creates challenges in clearly identifying the position of African States on State sponsored cyber operations and therefore creates a situation where a broad interpretation of existing regimes has to be undertaken in order to attempt an identification of African positions. Also, to some extent, it may be argued that the mere participation of many African States in UNGGE processes may not really result in the easy identification of their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations if those States still lack robust cyber capabilities and basic capacities on cybersecurity governance. As such, in the absence of robust national cyber capabilities and basic cybersecurity governance capacities, the awareness that will be derived by African States following their participation in international cyber norms processes may produce little or no effect in terms of identifying their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nAnother challenge is that many African countries are still in the primary stages of tackling cybercrime and are in the process of establishing cybercrime laws, policies, and institutional frameworks. For example, as of 2021, many African countries did not have cybercrime laws, cybersecurity strategies or national Computer Emergency Response Teams. There is also a lack of awareness amongst policy makers on issues relating to State sponsored cyber operations. For example, lack of awareness amongst policy makers in some countries has resulted in poor interest in funding training for cybersecurity skills due to fears over the dual use of such skills. In 2016, it was reported that\n See E. Calandro and N. Berglund, *Bridging The Cyber Norms Debate With Evidence*, Discussion paper submitted to the UN Open Ended Working Group (OWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Communications Technology in the Context of International Security, pp. 1–3, <https: 12=\"\" 2019=\"\" discussion-paper-oewg-international-meeting.pdf=\"\"ிழoloads=\"\" www.un.org=\"\" ww.gov=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n See U.J.

The challenges of lack of awareness amongst policy makers and poor funding limit research and development initiatives that could help in developing the positions of African States on State sponsored cyber operations. Lack of awareness and funding is also caused by the fact that cybersecurity issues including the threat of State sponsored cyber operations is not really considered as a national security priority in many African States. This is also not unconnected with the fact that many African States face physical national security challenges such as terrorism which policy makers usually consider more pervasive than cybersecurity challenges.\n## 6 Conclusion\nWhile African regional organizations and States have established regional and national legal and policy measures to promote norms for cybersecurity governance, those measures largely focus on cybercrime control and cybersecurity governance. Although such measures show the willingness of African States to promote cyber stability, they do not address concerns relating to State\n See N.K.

As international strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fiercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces. Being one of the major victims of hacker attacks, China is confronted with grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure. As cyberspace weighs more in military security, China will expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defense, support for the country’s endeavors in cyberspace and participation in international cyber cooperation, so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability”.",

As such, there are growing concerns that State sponsored cyber operations can harm the critical infrastructure and information systems of other States. In Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. However, to a large extent the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. However, an inquiry has not been undertaken to identify emerging African positions on international law and State sponsored cyber operations. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to inquire into emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations within the context of international law. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter will further consider challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n* Asst.

However, the integration of computer and digital communications technologies into all aspects of life has redefined traditional notions of security. Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”. Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations. Thus, cyberspace has extended the battlefield and is viewed as the fifth battle space alongside the more traditional domains such as land, air, sea and space.\nIn furtherance of the above view, some States and international military organizations have developed defence doctrines which recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. For example, in 1999, the United States Department of Defense Report on the Legal Issues of Information Operations observed that there is “an obvious military interest in being able to interfere with an adversary’s information systems, and in being able to protect one’s own”. In 2010, the United States Department of Defense recognized cyberspace as a\n1. See M.

See Department of Defense, Office of General Counsel, An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, (The United States Department of Defense Office of General Counsel, May 1999) p. 45.\nUCHENNA ORJI\ndomain of warfare. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace which was launched in July, 2011 recognizes that cyberspace, despite being a man-made domain, “is now a relevant domain for DoD activities as the naturally occurring domains of land, sea, air, and space”. Accordingly, the United States DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace declares that “the DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace’s potential”. In 2011, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the United Kingdom recognized that “cyberspace has now grown to become a domain where strategic advantage – industrial or military – can be won or lost”.\nSimilarly, in 2011, the Russian Federation Armed Forces’ Information Space Activities Concept recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations. The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept appears to largely classify cyberspace with the term “information space”. It defines “Military conflict in the information space” as “a form of interstate or intra-state conflicts with the use of information weapons”. The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept also defines “Information War” as:\nthe confrontation between two or more states in the information space with the purpose of inflicting damage to information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining the political, economic and social systems, a massive psychological manipulation of the population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force.\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2016, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) during its Warsaw Summit recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. In this regard, the NATO Cyber Pledge which was adopted at the Summit pledges to ensure that Member States are “capable of defending themselves in cyberspace as in the air, on land and at sea”. Therefore, cyberattacks with demonstrated aggressive intentions can trigger the collective security mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.\nWith the recognition of cyberspace as a domain of warfare, there have been growing concerns over the potential of State cyber operations to endanger international peace and security. This has prompted several calls to promote stability in cyberspace through the establishment of norms and legal regimes that promote responsible behaviour by States in cyberspace. Such calls led\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nthe United Nations (UN) to convene a Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States” and also to propose measures to address them. The UNGGE addressed issues relating to cyber operations by States and recommended that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law which intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public. This recommendation is, however, not legally binding on States, but rather provides a framework of international best practices that States should consider with a view to promoting cyber stability.\nIn Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa, however, appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. This chapter seeks to identify emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter further considers challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nThe chapter is divided into five sections. The first section is this introduction. The second section discusses the concept of State Sponsored Cyber Operations and Cyber Stability and also considers international law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations. It addresses the threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations in Africa. The third section identifies African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations by considering the provisions of African regional instruments such as the African Union Constitutive Act, African Union Declarations, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the African Union Non-Aggression Pact, the ECOWAS Protocol on Non-Aggression, and the SADC\n See UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174 (22 July 2015), 8 at paragraph 13(f).\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 2 State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nIn simple terms, State sponsored cyber operations refer to cyberattacks that are conducted by a State to disrupt or exploit the computer systems of a targeted State or cause harm to the computer systems and critical infrastructure of the targeted State with the objective of gaining an advantage over the targeted State. Such attacks may be conducted directly by a State through its institutions or through a non-State proxy with the support of a State. Targets of State sponsored cyber operations are usually critical infrastructure. However, all forms of computing devices connected to information networks are also potential targets of State sponsored cyber operations.\nState sponsored cyber operations can be executed through malicious cyber activities such as: the deployment of viruses, computer worms and malware that can disrupt and harm critical infrastructure; the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices; the use of hacking to steal critical data from institutions, governments and businesses; the use of ransomware to hold critical computer systems hostage; the use of cyber espionage to access national security information; and the use of online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within a country.\nA distinctive feature of State sponsored cyber operations is that they are generally cheaper than traditional military operations and can be carried out even by small States that may lack the technological capacities to carry out attacks. Such States can compensate for their disadvantage by hiring proxies. Therefore, at comparatively low risk and cost, significant damage and disruption can be inflicted on the intended target with little fear of reprisal given the challenges of attributing attacks to a particular individual or entity in cyberspace. Due to the challenge of attribution, State actors, criminal actors or non-State actors can loop through different computer systems in the process of perpetrating cyberattacks or even orchestrate attacks to appear to originate from government computers in another country. Thus, the problem of\nUCHENNA ORJI\nattribution creates uncertainty in identifying the origin of cyberattacks or the motive behind such attacks. As such, the nature of cyberspace gives disproportionate power to small and relatively insignificant malicious actors who can easily target foreign countries with a high degree of anonymity.\nSeveral reported cyber incidents have been classified as State sponsored cyber operations. For example, in May, 2007, Estonia experienced a series of massive and coordinated cyberattacks which targeted the country's public and private critical information infrastructure. The attacks deployed botnets of one over million computers located in over 50 countries around the world and the incident – classified as the world's first cyber war – is linked to Russia. In 2008, during the brief Russian-Georgia conflict, Georgia alleged that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against its government. Similar attacks were also launched against Georgia in 2019. The 2010 Stuxnet attack which targeted and destroyed Iran's nuclear centrifuges was reported to be a joint cyber operation between the United States and Israel code-named Olympic Games. In 2015, it was alleged that Russia had launched cyberattacks against Ukraine.\n See U.J.

Another definition refers to ‘cyber stability’ as “a geostrategic condition whereby users of the cyber domain enjoy the greatest possible benefits to political, civic, social, and economic life, while preventing and managing conduct that may undermine those benefits at the national, regional, and international levels”. It has been observed that this definition creates a basis from which to identify when stability is the goal and also to discern what is potentially relevant, useful, and strategic information about activity in the cyber domain from what is not. Cyber stability has also been defined as referring to “a state of relations between States characterized by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the States have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits”. The Report on a\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nFramework for International Cyber Stability, which was commissioned by the United States, defines cyber stability as “an environment where all participants, including nation-States, non-governmental organizations, commercial enterprises, and individuals, can positively and dependably enjoy the benefits of cyberspace; where there are benefits to cooperation and to avoidance of conflict, and where there are disincentives for these actors to engage in malicious cyber activity”.32\nA common thread that appears to run through the above definitions of cyber stability is that the concept aims to prevent conflict or hostilities in cyberspace. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability is used to classify measures that aim to prevent or minimize conflict between actors, including States, in cyberspace. As such, the concept aims to minimize threats and conduct that can escalate tensions between States in cyberspace. However, despite the above definitions of cyber stability, the concept is to a large extent regarded as an emerging concept that has not yet been developed as an analytic category.33\nAttempts have also been made to define an African view of cyber stability that is distinguishable from the global view.34 In this regard, it has been argued that in many ways the global views of cyber stability in dominant literature do not apply to African States and that the dominant views of cyber stability which promote regulatory openness, interoperability and global integration have been argued as differing from the views of African countries, which consider that global integration can bring instability through dependence.35 This argument may hold to the extent that many African States promote the idea of national self-sufficiency and independence in the development of information communications infrastructure so as to prevent digital colonialism and dependence on technologically advanced countries.36 However, that argument does not hold in the context of promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, because African States have taken steps to establish\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nregional and national measures to promote cybersecurity governance in compliance with global standards. For example, African States have established regional treaties to promote cybersecurity governance such as the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Directive on Fighting Cybercrime, which both require Member States to establish legal measures to criminalize and control cybercrimes and also establish frameworks for international cooperation on cybercrime. In addition, some African States are parties to international treaties such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime through which they participate in the Convention's extensive international cooperation framework and provide or receive mutual assistance from Western and non-Western countries that are parties to the Convention. These African developments tend towards regional and global integration in cybersecurity governance arrangements and challenge the argument that African States consider that global integration can bring instability through dependency.\nIn more practical terms, the concept of cyber stability aims to promote responsible State behaviour with a view to addressing the security challenges of the information society. This for example requires States to establish appropriate legal, policy and regulatory measures to protect cyber users and cyber infrastructure within their jurisdiction, and also ensure that cyber activities which are conducted within their jurisdiction do not cause harm to other individuals or infrastructure in another jurisdiction. The need to promote cyber stability arises from the increasing interconnectedness of national information communication networks in different countries. This has ushered in a new age of network interdependence where the security of each country's network is\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nalso dependent on the actions of State and non-State actors around the world. Thus, in this state of network interdependence, malicious cyber activities can have trans-boundary effects. Hence, malicious cyber activities which are conducted in a particular State can harm individuals or infrastructure located in another State. This also has potential to affect relations between States in a manner that can endanger international peace and security. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability requires States to maintain governance responsibility over cyber activities on their territory and refrain from cyber activities that can cause harm to persons or infrastructure in other States.\nThe concept of cyber stability enshrines elements of the international principles of trans-boundary harm and State responsibility. These principles were recognized in different contexts in the Corfu Channel Case, where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that a State may not \"allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\",[42] and in the Trail Smelter Case, where it was held that \"no State has right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein\".[43] These principles also exist in international telecommunications law. For example, Article 38.5 of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) requires Member States not to cause harm to the operation of telecommunications in other States. Thus, it declares that \"Member States recognize the necessity of taking practical measures to prevent the operation of electrical apparatus and installations of all kinds from disrupting the operation of telecommunication installations within the jurisdiction of other Member States\".[44]\n## 2.2 International Law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nCalls for norms and legal regimes to govern the conduct of States with respect to cyber activities that can endanger international peace and security $^{45}$ have sought to promote cyber stability by proposing the establishment of rules to ensure responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. $^{46}$ Such calls have led to\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nthe establishment of international initiatives to promote cyber stability. In this regard, issues concerning international cyber stability were first placed on the agenda of the UN by the Russian Federation in 1998 when it proposed UN General Assembly Resolution 53/70 on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was adopted without vote on 4 December, 1998 following a recommendation of the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security. Since then, that Resolution has been repeated annually. In particular, the Resolution noted the need to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, and expressed concerns that information technologies “can potentially be used for purposes that are consistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States”. Subsequently, between 2004 and 2017, the United Nations convened the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs [information and communication technologies] by States” and also propose measures to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence building measures.\nIn particular, the third UN GGE made several landmark conclusions, including that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\ncontrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public.53 It also concluded that “international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”.54 Other significant conclusions that were reached by the third UN GGE include that:\n(a) State sovereignty and international norms and principles which flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory;55\n(b) States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts and must also ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs, and that States must meet their obligations for internationally wrongful acts attributable to them.56\nHowever, while the UN GGE’s reports are not legally binding, their recommendations carry significant influence in shaping global cyber-security governance, as they can provide a basis for developing rules to promote responsible cyber conduct by States.\nAlso between 2009 and 2012, the Tallinn based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre convened an international group of distinguished international law academics to study how international law applies to cyber operations conducted by States.57 The study resulted in the publication of an academic and non-binding treatise known as the Tallinn Manual in 201358 with a second edition in 2017.59 The Manual generally advances the position that principles of existing international law apply to cyber operations without the need for new international legal regimes. However, while the United States and many Western countries support the view that existing international law applies to cyber operations without the need for new international\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 2.3 Africa and the Threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrica comprises 55 sovereign States and is classified as the world's second largest and second most populous continent after Asia, with a terrestrial mass of 30, 2044,049 million square kilometres and a human population of over one billion people. The continent has five geographical sub-regions, comprising: Southern Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, and West Africa. The African Union (AU) is the most prominent regional intergovernmental organization that unites African States and it comprises 55 sovereign States. Other notable intergovernmental organizations that operate within Africa's sub-regions include: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) which comprises 19 Member States, the Economic Community of West African West States (ECOWAS) which comprises 15 Member States, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) which comprises 16 Member States and the East African Community (EAC) which comprises six States.\nThe increasing penetration of ICTs in Africa has been followed with their growing integration in critical national sectors. For example, banking and financial services sectors in African States are increasingly integrating ICTs to enhance service delivery and improve consumer satisfaction. Also, across\n See E.

For example, in January, 2018, China denied that the computer network equipment it had supplied to the AU allowed it to access confidential information from the AU.73 In June 2020, following a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam being built on the Nile River, it was reported that Egyptian hackers had launched cyberattacks on a number of Ethiopian websites.74 In December, 2020, it was reported that Chinese hackers had been accessing the security footage from cameras installed at the AU headquarters. Also in December, 2020, it was reported that Facebook found that\nApplications (2012), pp. 145-150; M. Andrianaivo and Kangni Kpodar, 'ICT, Financial Inclusion, and Growth: Evidence from African Countries', WP/11/73 IMF Working Paper, (2011), pp. 4-41.\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nRussians and individuals affiliated with the French military were using fake Facebook accounts to conduct information operations in Africa.75\nAlready, several African States and regional organizations have established legal measures to promote cybersecurity governance. For example, in 2011, the ECOWAS adopted a Directive to fight cybercrime within the ECOWAS region.76 Also in 2011, COMESA developed a Model Cybercrime Bill with a view to providing a uniform framework that would serve as a guide for the development of cybercrime laws in Member States.77 In 2012, the SADC adopted a Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime to serve as a guide for the development of cybersecurity laws in SADC Member States.78 In 2014, the AU adopted the Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection to harmonize the laws of African States on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control.79 To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa has been on curbing cybercrime and it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace by African States. However, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n## 3 Identifying African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrican regional organizations have legal instruments on cybersecurity such as the ECOWAS Directive on Cybercrime, the COMESA Model Cybercrime Bill, the SADC Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime, the AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Cybersecurity Strategy. However, these instruments only focus on cybersecurity governance and cybercrime control and have not explicitly addressed State sponsored\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\noperations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional instruments and declarations that could indicate emerging positions on State sponsored cyber operations. Such instruments and declarations exist within the framework of African regional organizations such as the AU, the ECOWAS, and the SADC and will now be discussed.\n## 3.1 The Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU)\nThe Constitutive Act sets down the Objectives of the Union, which include inter alia to: \"promote peace, security, and stability on the continent\". In furtherance of its objectives, the AU establishes a range of governing principles which include: the establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent; a prohibition of the use of force or threat to use force among Member States of the Union; non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another; the right of Member States to live and coexist in peace and security; and rejection of acts of impunity, acts of terrorism and subversive activities. These principles in the AU Constitutive Act do not expressly mention cyber stability; however, they can be broadly interpreted as accommodating recent developments that affect cyber stability. For example, acts that affect the peace, security and stability of African States in contemporary times include State sponsored cyber operations that target critical national infrastructure and data. As such, the above principles of the AU Constitutive Act impose broad positive obligations on Member States to refrain from engaging in acts that will affect the peace, security and stability of Africa regardless of whether such acts were conducted offline or through cyberspace.\nIt is also possible for the AU principle on the prohibition of non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another Member State could be violated by State sponsored cyber operations that seek to use hacking operations or online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within an African State. This would apply to instances where a Member State uses hacking operations to influence the election outcome in another Member State or where a Member State uses online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption within another Member State with the objective of achieving a negative state of affairs in the targeted State. In addition, the AU principle on the prohibition of subversive activities would broadly apply to acts of subversion carried out through the cyberspace by a Member State against another Member State. For example, cyberspace can be used to spread disinformation or hate speech with the aim of creating dissension and destabilizing a Member State. Therefore, the principle of prohibition of subversive activities establishes broad positive obligations that would require a Member State to prevent its\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nterritory and resources from being used to encourage or commit acts of subversion against another Member State through cyberspace.\n## 3.2 The AU Non-aggression and Common Defence Pact\nThe AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact was adopted in 2005 and seeks “to put an end to conflicts of any kind within and among States in Africa in order to create conditions for socio-economic development and integration of the continent as well as the fulfilment of the aspirations of [African] peoples”. The Pact entered into force on 18 December 2009 after its ratification by 15 AU Member States. As of August, 2021, 44 AU Member States had signed the Pact, while 22 Member States had ratified it. To a large extent, the Pact is regarded as containing by far “the most elaborate political commitment of African States not to commit aggression against each other”.\nThe Pact elaborately defines ‘aggression’ as “the use, intentionally, and knowingly, of armed force or any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity, against the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and human security of the population of a State party to this Pact, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations or the Constitutive Act of the African Union ...”. Some elements of the above definition of aggression appear to create broad scope for classifying hostile cyber operations conducted by a Member State against another Member State within the meaning of aggression. For example, the Pact does not restrict the definition of aggression to the use of ‘armed force’, but includes ‘any other hostile act’ conducted by a State or non-State actor against the ‘sovereignty’ and ‘human security’ of the population of a Member State. In modern times, hostile acts against the sovereignty of a State would include disruption of its critical information infrastructure,\n See U.J. Orji, ‘Rethinking the African Union Non-Aggression Treaty as a Framework for Promoting Responsible in Cyberspace’, Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public &amp; International Law (MPII) Research Paper Series, No. 2021–24, (September, 2021), pp.7–20, <https: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"3930007\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n See Preamble to the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact (2005).\n See The Status List: AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact, (January, 2020) <https: africa-union-non-aggression-and-common-defence-pact=\"\" en=\"\" au.int=\"\" treaties=\"\" treaties@africa-union-non-aggression-and-common-defence-pact=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n See Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression, Preventing Aggression in the African Context, <https: 8=\"\" documents=\"\" crimeofaggression.info=\"\" bots_aggression_in_africa.pdf=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact (Emphasis added).</https:></https:></https:>\nUCHENNA ORJI\ngiven the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security. As such, under the Pact, there is scope for classifying a Member State's cyber operations that disrupts another Member State's critical information infrastructure as a hostile act that fits into the definition of aggression under the Pact.\nThe Pact's broad definition of aggression as including “... any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity ...” also provides a basis for considering application of the Pact as an African framework for regulating State cyber operations. This is because hostile acts that violate the sovereignty of a State would include attacks that target its critical information infrastructure, given the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.\nIn addition, specific acts that constitute ‘acts of aggression’ (regardless of a declaration of war) under the Pact include: the use of any weapon against the territory of a Member State; the blockade of the ports, coasts or airspace of a Member State; the action of a Member State in allowing its territory to be used by another Member State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; and technological assistance of any kind, intelligence and training to another State for use in committing acts of aggression against another Member State. Thus, the above elements that exist within the definition of aggression provide broad scope for considering the Pact as a framework that applies to State cyber operations. For example, ‘any weapon’ within the context of the Pact would technically include a cyber-weapon such as malware, given that such a weapon can be used to execute an attack against critical information infrastructure located in the territory of a Member State. Also, cyberattacks can be used to conduct a blockade of Member State ports, coasts or airspace, while the use of a cyber-weapon to immobilize the armed forces or marine fleets of a Member State would technically fit within the Pact’s definition of aggression. This also applies where a Member State engages in acts of cyber espionage which could be used for military aggression against another Member State or provides another Member State with technological assistance of any kind such as cyber capability to conduct aggression against another Member State. In addition, a Member State that allows its territory to be used by another Member State to conduct cyberattacks against another Member State or provides support\n Art. 1 AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.\n See Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact [emphasis added].\n Ibid.\n See C.

The Council functions as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and efficient response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa.89 The Peace and Security Council, which is responsible for implementing the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact,90 is required to periodically update the Pact so as to enhance its implementation in light of contemporary security challenges.91 While the Council has not carried out any update to reflect cyber-security challenges such as State sponsored cyber operations, recent developments appear to indicate that the Council is developing a position on State sponsored cyber operations. In May, 2019, the Council issued a Communiqué on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa. The Communiqué recognized \"the increasing vulnerability of the entire Continent to the growing threat of cyber-crimes/cyberattacks\".92 In particular, the Council expressed concerns that \"a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely\" and that \"increasing global threats to Cyber Security ... constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security\".93 In furtherance of these concerns, the Council requested the AU Commission to work in collaboration with the AU Department for Peace and Security, Member States and the Regional Economic Communities to expeditiously develop a Continental Cyber Security Strategy and to report back to\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nthe Council before the 2020 Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government. However, while to some extent the above statements indicate the Council's emerging position on State cyber operations, the proposed AU Continental Cyber Security Strategy is yet to be developed to clearly express the AU's position on State cyber operations.\n## 3.4 Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa\nIn November 2019, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights adopted the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. The Declaration was adopted pursuant to Article 45(1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, which mandates the African Commission to promote human and peoples' rights by formulating principles and rules to address legal problems relating to human and peoples' rights and fundamental freedoms upon which African States may base their legislation. The Declaration affirms the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and access to information enshrined in Article 9 of the African Charter. Principle 38 of the Declaration prohibits Member States from interfering with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. In this regard, Principle 38 (1) of the Declaration states that:\nStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\nMore importantly, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration provides that:\nStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n Ibid, at paragraph 13.\n See Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. Adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights at its 65th Ordinary Session held from 21 October to 10 November 2019 in Banjul, the Gambia, <https: 2019.pdf=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 96=\"\" a=\"\" account=\"\" africa.=\"\" africa.=\"\" and=\"\" at=\"\" be=\"\" by=\"\" cf000000=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" d=\"\" d:=\"\" eachpr.org=\"\" file=\"\" fles=\"\" fles-englis=\"\" for=\"\" free=\"\" freeform=\"\" gambia,=\"\" in=\"\" jbid,=\"\" krtps:=\"\" knowerper09=\"\" of=\"\" on=\"\" on%20freedom%20of%20expression_eng_2019.pdf=\"\" public=\"\" public/document=\"\" public?document=\"\" rpch=\"\" se=\"\" see=\"\" state=\"\" states=\"\" the=\"\" visual=\"\" www.achpr.org=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nIn addition, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration imposes a positive obligation on Member States not to \"condone any disruption\" of Internet access or other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population. Thus, in fulfilling the above positive obligation a Member State is not only required to refrain from conducting cyber operations that will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, but the obligation further requires a Member State to condemn and refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors that conduct cyber operations to disrupt Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, including critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education.\n## 3.5 The ECOWAS\nThe founding Treaty of the ECOWAS establishes its objectives, which include: promoting regional cooperation and integration and maintaining peace, stability and security within the region.97 In pursuance of the objectives to maintain peace, stability and security within the region, the ECOWAS adopted a Protocol on Non-Aggression in 1978, which imposes obligations on Member States to refrain from using \"force or aggression\" and \"any other means inconsistent with\" the Charter of the United Nations or Constitutive Act of the AU against the territorial integrity and political independence of\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nother Member States. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations. However, its provisions can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 2 of the Protocol requires every Member State to “refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States”. The Protocol does not define the meaning of terms such as ‘subversion’, ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’, hence resort shall be had to other definitions of those terms. ‘Subversion’ simply refers to undermining the power and authority of an established system or institution or State. ‘Hostility’ refers to hostile or unfriendly behaviour such as acts of warfare. Similarly, ‘aggression’ refers to hostile behaviour such as the act of attacking a State. Thus, a broad interpretation of acts of ‘subversion’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will include State sponsored cyber operations that seek to undermine the power and authority of a Member State. This, for example, will include State sponsored online disinformation campaigns that are targeted to cause disruption and chaos within another Member State. A broad interpretation of acts of ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will also include State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure located within the territory of a Member State. In addition, fulfilment of the obligation under Article 2 of the Protocol will require Member States to condemn cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure in another Member State and also to refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors in the conduct of such operations.\nArticle 3 of the Protocol further imposes obligations on Member States to prevent foreigners resident within their territories from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other Member States. A broad interpretation of this obligation in the context of cyber operations implies, for example, that Member States are required to hold foreigners resident within their territories accountable where they engage in or encourage cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State. In addition, the Protocol requires every Member State to prevent “non-resident foreigners”\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 3.6 The SADC\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the SADC is to safeguard peace, stability and security within the SADC region. In pursuance of this objective, the SADC adopted a Mutual Defence Protocol in August, 2003. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations; however, Article 8 of the Protocol can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 8 of the Protocol provides that: “State parties undertake not to nurture, harbour or support any person, group of persons or institutions whose aim is to destabilize the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party”. Article 2 of the Protocol defines the term destabilize as:\nto instigate, plan, execute or assist in any of the following:\n(a) an armed attack against a State party;\n(b) sabotage aimed at the people of a State Party or an asset of a State party, whether inside or outside the territory of the State party; or,\n(c) any act or activity aimed at changing the constitutional order of a State Party through unconstitutional mean.\nIn light of the above definition of destabilization, a broad interpretation of Article 8 of the Protocol would require, for example, that a State Party is to refrain from nurturing, harbouring, instigating or supporting any person, group of persons or institutions that seek to carry out cyber operations with the aim of disrupting or sabotaging national critical information infrastructure with a view to destabilizing the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party. The SADC has also recognized a connection between cybersecurity and regional instability. For example, in 2004, the SADC Strategic Plan on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation recognized the need to build capacity to combat cybercrime and terrorism in\n See Art. 2 SADC Mutual Defense Protocol (2003).\nUCHENNA ORJI\norder to protect the region against instability arising from intrastate conflicts and aggression.\n## 4 Identifying National Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nOnly a few African countries have considered issues relating to cyber conflict in their laws and policies on national security and cybersecurity. In most cases, such issues have been highlighted briefly in laws and policy instruments without providing clear definitions or national doctrines. For example, in Ghana, the Cybersecurity Act provides for the establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority which will be responsible “for taking measures in response to cybersecurity incidents that occur within and outside the country which may threaten national security; the defence of the country; the economy of the country; [and] international relations between the State and other countries”. However, aside from this provision, Ghana has not established a clear national doctrine that addresses cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Malawi, the National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes the development of a cybersecurity contingency plan that will include the role of the military during cyberattacks and emergencies. The Strategy also proposes the development of a Cyber Defence Strategy that establishes approaches to addressing national security threats in cyberspace. The Strategy further grants the military a prominent role in the management of cybersecurity incidents. In this regard, the Strategy provides that the Malawi Defence Force in collaboration with the Malawi Computer Emergency Response Team “will continuously monitor the cyberspace sphere to identify and address cyber threats and risks to the National Security of Malawi”. However, aside from the above declarations in Malawi’s National Cybersecurity Strategy, the country is yet to develop a clear national doctrine that addresses State sponsored cyber operations or acts of aggression in cyberspace. Similarly, in Kenya, the government prescribes a broad role for the Ministry of Defence in cybersecurity governance.\n See SADC Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (2004), p. 38.\n See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy (2019–2024), p. 16, <https: 160=\"\" api.pppc.mw=\"\" national-cybers-col.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n Ibid.\n See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy, p. 29.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn this regard, the Kenyan Ministry of Defence White Paper declares that \"cyber-attacks can undermine State security. [The] Ministry of Defence in collaboration with other stakeholders must develop appropriate capacity and institute measures to safeguard information systems\".[109] However, beyond this declaration, Kenya is yet to develop the role of the military in the management of cybersecurity threats, and the country is yet to develop a policy on cyber defence or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Morocco, the military plays a prominent role in cybersecurity governance. In this regard, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has the responsibility of overseeing the development of cybersecurity and cyber defence capabilities and for ensuring the resilience and availability of the country's military operational networks.[110] Morocco has also developed several cyber-related capabilities; however, despite the military's role in the management of cybersecurity threats, the country is yet to develop a formalized military policy or electronic on cybersecurity.[111]\nSouth Africa appears to be the only African country that has recognized cyber warfare concerns in its national defence policy. In this regard, South Africa's Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 recognizes that \"information warfare\" including the targeting of political institutions and processes, is a national concern.[112] In a military context, the policy classifies South African cyberspace as a \"domain\" under \"the physical control and political authority of the South African State\".[113] The policy also classifies cybersecurity as \"a central national priority\" and further requires the Department of Defence to develop a cyber defence capability that will enhance national cyber resilience.[114] The policy further mandates the Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to focus on cyber defence by establishing a cyber defence capability within the SANDF. However, beyond this brief recognition of information warfare in the Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, South Africa is yet to develop clear doctrines on cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n\nUCHENNA ORJI\nIn Nigeria, the National Security Strategy recognizes that “cyber threats are inherently asymmetrical with an increasing range of actors engaged in espionage and warfare”. The Strategy also classifies four major cyber threats with significant capability to damage Nigeria’s national security and economy to include: cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and “cyber conflict”. The Strategy further proposes development of a national strategic framework dedicated to cyber defence including capacity building programmes for the military. In addition, the Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy (2014) recognizes the country’s emerging opportunities in cyberspace to include exploitation of cyberspace to advance military capability in engaging external threats and conflicts. The Policy also classifies cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage and cyber conflict as major threats to Nigeria’s national security and stability.\nUnder Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014), cyberspace is recognized as the fifth domain for driving critical national functions including national security and defence operations. The Strategy classifies sources of cyber threats to include foreign States and State sponsored actors and proposes to articulate an integrated containment of cyber threats including cyber conflict, violence and terror threats against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Strategy’s principle of integrated containment seeks to articulate containment measures which focus on shared responsibilities and cooperation among all State actors at the national, regional and global levels. However, the Strategy does not develop elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations, nor does it consider application of international law to cyber operations.\nRecently, the Office of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser reviewed its National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy to reflect emerging concerns on cyber threats and national security. Following the review, both the Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy are now contained in one document known as the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021). An element of the new Policy that relates to the threat of State sponsored cyber\n See Nigeria National Security Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p. 26.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p.8, <https: cypersecurity=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" national_strategies_repository=\"\" natoria_2014_national_cybersecurity_strategy.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\noperations is the issue of foreign interference in elections. In this regard, the Policy recognizes that State and non-State actors have the potential to exert leverage on cyberspace to interfere with the electoral process including interference with elections' critical infrastructure and the conduct of cyber operations to disrupt or influence the electorate.^[119]^ Another relevant element of the Policy is that it seeks to mainstream voluntary non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace through international awareness and engagement.^[120]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to adopt voluntary non-binding norms that promote responsible State behaviour and also participate in ongoing international dialogue on cyber norms. The Policy also seeks to enhance Nigeria's cyber defence capability by investing in the military to identify, prevent and repel any cyber threats to Nigeria's sovereignty and national security.^[121]^\nThe Policy further proposes establishment of a Defence Space Administration that will coordinate the cyber activities of armed forces in defending Nigeria against cyberattacks.^[122]^ The Defence Space Administration is meant to work with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre to develop a national cyber defence plan for Nigeria. More importantly, the proposed National Cyber Defence Plan is meant to address cross-border cyberattacks while also \"embracing requisite restraints obligated under international law\".^[123]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to comply with existing international law when conducting cyber operations. Thus, given that Nigeria has not earlier stated the need for an international regime to regulate States in the conduct of cyber operations, it can therefore be argued to a large extent that the Policy's recognition of \"requisite restraints obligated under international law\" appears to indicate Nigeria's position on the applicability of existing international law to cyber operations conducted by States. Therefore, it can be argued that Nigeria supports the view of the United States and Western countries that existing international law applies to cyber operations.\nHowever, pending establishment of the National Cyber Defence Plan proposed in the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), the Policy in its present form does not establish elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber\n^[119]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abuja, 2021), pp. 5–6.\n^[120]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), p. 14.\n^[121]^ Ibid., p. 14.\n^[122]^ Ibid., pp. 41–42.\n^[123]^ Ibid., p. 42.\nUCHENNA ORJI\naggression or State sponsored cyber operations. Despite the absence of such doctrines, the Nigerian Army established a Cyber Warfare Command in 2018. According to the Nigerian Army, the Cyber Warfare Command will be responsible for monitoring, defending and attacking subversive elements in cyberspace. In 2020, the Nigerian Army Cyber Warfare Command launched its first cyber warfare exercise, which was described as Africa's first-ever cyber warfare exercise. The exercise, according to the Nigerian Army, was designed to identify, track, and counter negative propaganda in social media and cyberspace. However, the exercise raised human rights concerns given that it was launched during the nationwide campaign against police brutality known as the #ENDSARS campaign. These concerns were further heightened by the exercise's objectives which appear to lend some credence to the view that the exercise sought to stifle online dissent during the #ENDSARS campaign.\n## 5 Challenges in Identifying African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nTo a large extent, African States and regional organizations have been absent from the ongoing international debate on norms for the governance of State behaviour in cyberspace. For example, since the commencement of the UNGGE process in 2004, only nine African countries have held its membership and such membership has been for a duration of not more than five\n See K. Omonobi, 'Nigerian Army's Cyber Warfare Command begins operation', *Vanguard* (29 August 2018), <https: 08=\"\" 2018=\"\" nigerian-army-cyber-warfare-command-begins-operation=\"\" www.vanguardngr.com=\"\"></https:>, visited on 15 February 2022.\n *Ibid.*\n See A.

The absence of many African States and regional organizations in the UNGGE process apparently has an effect on their levels of awareness of State sponsored cyber operations and the application of international law in that context. Thus, currently, many African States lack awareness about State sponsored cyber operations and the applicability of international law and this appears to reflect in their lack of policy and legal responses to issues in that regard. For example, no African State or regional organization has developed a robust regime on State sponsored cyber operations. Also no African State has clearly stated its position on the applicability of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations. This creates challenges in clearly identifying the position of African States on State sponsored cyber operations and therefore creates a situation where a broad interpretation of existing regimes has to be undertaken in order to attempt an identification of African positions. Also, to some extent, it may be argued that the mere participation of many African States in UNGGE processes may not really result in the easy identification of their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations if those States still lack robust cyber capabilities and basic capacities on cybersecurity governance. As such, in the absence of robust national cyber capabilities and basic cybersecurity governance capacities, the awareness that will be derived by African States following their participation in international cyber norms processes may produce little or no effect in terms of identifying their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nAnother challenge is that many African countries are still in the primary stages of tackling cybercrime and are in the process of establishing cybercrime laws, policies, and institutional frameworks. For example, as of 2021, many African countries did not have cybercrime laws, cybersecurity strategies or national Computer Emergency Response Teams. There is also a lack of awareness amongst policy makers on issues relating to State sponsored cyber operations. For example, lack of awareness amongst policy makers in some countries has resulted in poor interest in funding training for cybersecurity skills due to fears over the dual use of such skills. In 2016, it was reported that\n See E. Calandro and N.

The challenges of lack of awareness amongst policy makers and poor funding limit research and development initiatives that could help in developing the positions of African States on State sponsored cyber operations. Lack of awareness and funding is also caused by the fact that cybersecurity issues including the threat of State sponsored cyber operations is not really considered as a national security priority in many African States. This is also not unconnected with the fact that many African States face physical national security challenges such as terrorism which policy makers usually consider more pervasive than cybersecurity challenges.\n## 6 Conclusion\nWhile African regional organizations and States have established regional and national legal and policy measures to promote norms for cybersecurity governance, those measures largely focus on cybercrime control and cybersecurity governance.

As such, there are growing concerns that State sponsored cyber operations can harm the critical infrastructure and information systems of other States. In Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. However, to a large extent the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. However, an inquiry has not been undertaken to identify emerging African positions on international law and State sponsored cyber operations. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to inquire into emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations within the context of international law. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter will further consider challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n* Asst.

Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”.² Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations. Thus, cyberspace has extended the battlefield and is viewed as the fifth battle space alongside the more traditional domains such as land, air, sea and space.\nIn furtherance of the above view, some States and international military organizations have developed defence doctrines which recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. For example, in 1999, the United States Department of Defense Report on the Legal Issues of Information Operations observed that there is “an obvious military interest in being able to interfere with an adversary’s information systems, and in being able to protect one’s own”.³ In 2010, the United States Department of Defense recognized cyberspace as a\n1.

It defines “Military conflict in the information space” as “a form of interstate or intra-state conflicts with the use of information weapons”.⁹ The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept also defines “Information War” as:\nthe confrontation between two or more states in the information space with the purpose of inflicting damage to information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining the political, economic and social systems, a massive psychological manipulation of the population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force.¹⁰\n4 See C.

The form of war is accelerating to its evolution to informationalization”.¹²\nIn 2016, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) during its Warsaw Summit recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare.¹³ In this regard, the NATO Cyber Pledge which was adopted at the Summit pledges to ensure that Member States are “capable of defending themselves in cyberspace as in the air, on land and at sea”.¹⁴ Therefore, cyberattacks with demonstrated aggressive intentions can trigger the collective security mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.¹⁵\nWith the recognition of cyberspace as a domain of warfare, there have been growing concerns over the potential of State cyber operations to endanger international peace and security. This has prompted several calls to promote stability in cyberspace through the establishment of norms and legal regimes that promote responsible behaviour by States in cyberspace. Such calls led\n11 See B. Lilly and J. Cheravitch, ‘The Past, Present, and Future of Russia’s Cyber Strategy and Forces’, in T. Jančárková, et al., (eds.) Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE, Tallinn, 2020), pp. 133–134.\n12 See The State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China, China’s Military Strategy (Beijing, 27 May 2015). China’s Military Strategy further observed that: “Cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security. As international strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fiercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces. Being one of the major victims of hacker attacks, China is confronted with grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure. As cyberspace weighs more in military security, China will expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defense, support for the country’s endeavors in cyberspace and participation in international cyber cooperation, so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability”.\n13 See J.

The UNGGE addressed issues relating to cyber operations by States and recommended that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law which intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public.¹⁶ This recommendation is, however, not legally binding on States, but rather provides a framework of international best practices that States should consider with a view to promoting cyber stability.\nIn Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa, however, appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. This chapter seeks to identify emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter further considers challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nThe chapter is divided into five sections. The first section is this introduction. The second section discusses the concept of State Sponsored Cyber Operations and Cyber Stability and also considers international law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations. It addresses the threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations in Africa. The third section identifies African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations by considering the provisions of African regional instruments such as the African Union Constitutive Act, African Union Declarations, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the African Union Non-Aggression Pact, the ECOWAS Protocol on Non-Aggression, and the SADC\n¹⁶ See UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174 (22 July 2015), 8 at paragraph 13(f).\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n241\nMutual Defence Protocol. In this regard, the provisions of the above regional instruments are examined with a view to applying them to State sponsored cyber operations. The fourth section identifies African national positions on State sponsored cyber operations by examining legal and policy instruments on cybersecurity and national security. The fifth section highlights challenges in identifying African national positions on State sponsored cyber operations and then the conclusion follows.\n## 2 State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nIn simple terms, State sponsored cyber operations refer to cyberattacks that are conducted by a State to disrupt or exploit the computer systems of a targeted State or cause harm to the computer systems and critical infrastructure of the targeted State with the objective of gaining an advantage over the targeted State. Such attacks may be conducted directly by a State through its institutions or through a non-State proxy with the support of a State. Targets of State sponsored cyber operations are usually critical infrastructure. However, all forms of computing devices connected to information networks are also potential targets of State sponsored cyber operations.\nState sponsored cyber operations can be executed through malicious cyber activities such as: the deployment of viruses, computer worms and malware that can disrupt and harm critical infrastructure; the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices; the use of hacking to steal critical data from institutions, governments and businesses; the use of ransomware to hold critical computer systems hostage; the use of cyber espionage to access national security information; and the use of online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within a country.\nA distinctive feature of State sponsored cyber operations is that they are generally cheaper than traditional military operations and can be carried out even by small States that may lack the technological capacities to carry out attacks. Such States can compensate for their disadvantage by hiring proxies. Therefore, at comparatively low risk and cost, significant damage and disruption can be inflicted on the intended target with little fear of reprisal given the challenges of attributing attacks to a particular individual or entity in cyberspace. Due to the challenge of attribution, State actors, criminal actors or non-State actors can loop through different computer systems in the process of perpetrating cyberattacks or even orchestrate attacks to appear to originate from government computers in another country. Thus, the problem of\nUCHENNA ORJI\nattribution creates uncertainty in identifying the origin of cyberattacks or the motive behind such attacks.¹⁷ As such, the nature of cyberspace gives disproportionate power to small and relatively insignificant malicious actors who can easily target foreign countries with a high degree of anonymity.¹⁸\nSeveral reported cyber incidents have been classified as State sponsored cyber operations. For example, in May, 2007, Estonia experienced a series of massive and coordinated cyberattacks which targeted the country's public and private critical information infrastructure.¹⁹ The attacks deployed botnets of one over million computers located in over 50 countries around the world²⁰ and the incident – classified as the world's first cyber war – is linked to Russia.²¹ In 2008, during the brief Russian-Georgia conflict, Georgia alleged that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against its government.²² Similar attacks were also launched against Georgia in 2019.²³ The 2010 Stuxnet attack which targeted and destroyed Iran's nuclear centrifuges was reported to be a joint cyber operation between the United States and Israel code-named Olympic Games.²⁴ In 2015, it was alleged that Russia had launched cyberattacks against Ukraine.²⁵\n¹⁷ See U.J.

Therefore, the concept of cyber stability is used to classify measures that aim to prevent or minimize conflict between actors, including States, in cyberspace. As such, the concept aims to minimize threats and conduct that can escalate tensions between States in cyberspace. However, despite the above definitions of cyber stability, the concept is to a large extent regarded as an emerging concept that has not yet been developed as an analytic category.33\nAttempts have also been made to define an African view of cyber stability that is distinguishable from the global view.34 In this regard, it has been argued that in many ways the global views of cyber stability in dominant literature do not apply to African States and that the dominant views of cyber stability which promote regulatory openness, interoperability and global integration have been argued as differing from the views of African countries, which consider that global integration can bring instability through dependence.35 This argument may hold to the extent that many African States promote the idea of national self-sufficiency and independence in the development of information communications infrastructure so as to prevent digital colonialism and dependence on technologically advanced countries.36 However, that argument does not hold in the context of promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, because African States have taken steps to establish\n32 See International Security Advisory Board, Report on a Framework for International Cyber Stability (United States Department of State, 2 July 2014) Appendix B.1, at p. 33.\n33 See L.

For example, African States have established regional treaties to promote cybersecurity governance such as the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection³⁷ and the ECOWAS Directive on Fighting Cybercrime,³⁸ which both require Member States to establish legal measures to criminalize and control cybercrimes and also establish frameworks for international cooperation on cybercrime.³⁹ In addition, some African States are parties to international treaties such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime⁴⁰ through which they participate in the Convention's extensive international cooperation framework and provide or receive mutual assistance from Western and non-Western countries that are parties to the Convention.⁴¹ These African developments tend towards regional and global integration in cybersecurity governance arrangements and challenge the argument that African States consider that global integration can bring instability through dependency.\nIn more practical terms, the concept of cyber stability aims to promote responsible State behaviour with a view to addressing the security challenges of the information society. This for example requires States to establish appropriate legal, policy and regulatory measures to protect cyber users and cyber infrastructure within their jurisdiction, and also ensure that cyber activities which are conducted within their jurisdiction do not cause harm to other individuals or infrastructure in another jurisdiction. The need to promote cyber stability arises from the increasing interconnectedness of national information communication networks in different countries. This has ushered in a new age of network interdependence where the security of each country's network is\n37 See African Union (AU) Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, EX.CL/846(XXV) adopted at the 23rd Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union (Malabo, 27 June 2014).\n38 See ECOWAS Directive C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime, adopted at the Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers at Abuja, Nigeria (August 2011).\n39 See U.J.

Thus, in this state of network interdependence, malicious cyber activities can have trans-boundary effects. Hence, malicious cyber activities which are conducted in a particular State can harm individuals or infrastructure located in another State. This also has potential to affect relations between States in a manner that can endanger international peace and security. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability requires States to maintain governance responsibility over cyber activities on their territory and refrain from cyber activities that can cause harm to persons or infrastructure in other States.\nThe concept of cyber stability enshrines elements of the international principles of trans-boundary harm and State responsibility. These principles were recognized in different contexts in the Corfu Channel Case, where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that a State may not \"allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\", and in the Trail Smelter Case, where it was held that \"no State has right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein\". These principles also exist in international telecommunications law. For example, Article 38.5 of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) requires Member States not to cause harm to the operation of telecommunications in other States. Thus, it declares that \"Member States recognize the necessity of taking practical measures to prevent the operation of electrical apparatus and installations of all kinds from disrupting the operation of telecommunication installations within the jurisdiction of other Member States\".\n## 2.2 International Law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nCalls for norms and legal regimes to govern the conduct of States with respect to cyber activities that can endanger international peace and security $^{45}$ have sought to promote cyber stability by proposing the establishment of rules to ensure responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. $^{46}$ Such calls have led to\n42 See The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v.

In this regard, issues concerning international cyber stability were first placed on the agenda of the UN by the Russian Federation in 1998 when it proposed UN General Assembly Resolution 53/70 on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was adopted without vote on 4 December, 1998⁴⁷ following a recommendation of the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security.⁴⁸ Since then, that Resolution has been repeated annually.⁴⁹ In particular, the Resolution noted the need to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, and expressed concerns that information technologies “can potentially be used for purposes that are consistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States”.⁵⁰ Subsequently, between 2004 and 2017, the United Nations convened the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs [information and communication technologies] by States” and also propose measures to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence building measures.⁵¹\nIn particular, the third UN GGE⁵² made several landmark conclusions, including that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity\n47 See UN General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n48 See UN General Assembly, Role of Science and Technology in the Context of Security, Disarmament and Other related Fields, Report of the First Committee, A/53/576 (18 November, 1998).\n49 See UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, <https: disarmament=\"\" informationsecurity=\"\" topics=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></https:>, visited on 15 February 2022.

The African Union (AU) is the most prominent regional intergovernmental organization that unites African States and it comprises 55 sovereign States.⁶³ Other notable intergovernmental organizations that operate within Africa's sub-regions include: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)⁶⁴ which comprises 19 Member States, the Economic Community of West African West States (ECOWAS)⁶⁵ which comprises 15 Member States, the Southern African Development Community (SADC)⁶⁶ which comprises 16 Member States and the East African Community (EAC) which comprises six States.\nThe increasing penetration of ICTs in Africa⁶⁷ has been followed with their growing integration in critical national sectors.⁶⁸ For example, banking and financial services sectors in African States are increasingly integrating ICTs to enhance service delivery and improve consumer satisfaction.⁶⁹ Also, across\n⁶⁰ See E.

For example, in 2011, the ECOWAS adopted a Directive to fight cybercrime within the ECOWAS region.76 Also in 2011, COMESA developed a Model Cybercrime Bill with a view to providing a uniform framework that would serve as a guide for the development of cybercrime laws in Member States.77 In 2012, the SADC adopted a Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime to serve as a guide for the development of cybersecurity laws in SADC Member States.78 In 2014, the AU adopted the Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection to harmonize the laws of African States on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control.79 To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa has been on curbing cybercrime and it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace by African States. However, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n## 3 Identifying African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrican regional organizations have legal instruments on cybersecurity such as the ECOWAS Directive on Cybercrime, the COMESA Model Cybercrime Bill, the SADC Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime, the AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Cybersecurity Strategy. However, these instruments only focus on cybersecurity governance and cybercrime control and have not explicitly addressed State sponsored\n75 Ibid.\n76 See ECOWAS Directive C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime, adopted at the Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers at Abuja, Nigeria (August 2011).\n77 See Official Gazette of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Vol. 16 No. 2 (15 October 2011).\n78 See SADC Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime Version 2.0 Adopted on 2 March 2012.\n79 See African Union (AU) Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, EX.

Nevertheless, there are African regional instruments and declarations that could indicate emerging positions on State sponsored cyber operations. Such instruments and declarations exist within the framework of African regional organizations such as the AU, the ECOWAS, and the SADC and will now be discussed.\n## 3.1 The Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU)\nThe Constitutive Act sets down the Objectives of the Union, which include inter alia to: \"promote peace, security, and stability on the continent\". In furtherance of its objectives, the AU establishes a range of governing principles which include: the establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent; a prohibition of the use of force or threat to use force among Member States of the Union; non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another; the right of Member States to live and coexist in peace and security; and rejection of acts of impunity, acts of terrorism and subversive activities. These principles in the AU Constitutive Act do not expressly mention cyber stability; however, they can be broadly interpreted as accommodating recent developments that affect cyber stability. For example, acts that affect the peace, security and stability of African States in contemporary times include State sponsored cyber operations that target critical national infrastructure and data. As such, the above principles of the AU Constitutive Act impose broad positive obligations on Member States to refrain from engaging in acts that will affect the peace, security and stability of Africa regardless of whether such acts were conducted offline or through cyberspace.\nIt is also possible for the AU principle on the prohibition of non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another Member State could be violated by State sponsored cyber operations that seek to use hacking operations or online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within an African State. This would apply to instances where a Member State uses hacking operations to influence the election outcome in another Member State or where a Member State uses online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption within another Member State with the objective of achieving a negative state of affairs in the targeted State. In addition, the AU principle on the prohibition of subversive activities would broadly apply to acts of subversion carried out through the cyberspace by a Member State against another Member State. For example, cyberspace can be used to spread disinformation or hate speech with the aim of creating dissension and destabilizing a Member State. Therefore, the principle of prohibition of subversive activities establishes broad positive obligations that would require a Member State to prevent its\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nterritory and resources from being used to encourage or commit acts of subversion against another Member State through cyberspace.\n## 3.2 The AU Non-aggression and Common Defence Pact⁸⁰\nThe AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact was adopted in 2005 and seeks “to put an end to conflicts of any kind within and among States in Africa in order to create conditions for socio-economic development and integration of the continent as well as the fulfilment of the aspirations of [African] peoples”.⁸¹ The Pact entered into force on 18 December 2009 after its ratification by 15 AU Member States. As of August, 2021, 44 AU Member States had signed the Pact, while 22 Member States had ratified it.⁸² To a large extent, the Pact is regarded as containing by far “the most elaborate political commitment of African States not to commit aggression against each other”.⁸³\nThe Pact elaborately defines ‘aggression’ as “the use, intentionally, and knowingly, of armed force or any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity, against the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and human security of the population of a State party to this Pact, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations or the Constitutive Act of the African Union ...”.⁸⁴ Some elements of the above definition of aggression appear to create broad scope for classifying hostile cyber operations conducted by a Member State against another Member State within the meaning of aggression. For example, the Pact does not restrict the definition of aggression to the use of ‘armed force’, but includes ‘any other hostile act’ conducted by a State or non-State actor against the ‘sovereignty’ and ‘human security’ of the population of a Member State.

This is because hostile acts that violate the sovereignty of a State would include attacks that target its critical information infrastructure, given the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.\nIn addition, specific acts that constitute ‘acts of aggression’ (regardless of a declaration of war) under the Pact include: the use of any weapon against the territory of a Member State; the blockade of the ports, coasts or airspace of a Member State; the action of a Member State in allowing its territory to be used by another Member State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; and technological assistance of any kind, intelligence and training to another State for use in committing acts of aggression against another Member State.⁸⁷ Thus, the above elements that exist within the definition of aggression provide broad scope for considering the Pact as a framework that applies to State cyber operations. For example, ‘any weapon’ within the context of the Pact would technically include a cyber-weapon such as malware, given that such a weapon can be used to execute an attack against critical information infrastructure located in the territory of a Member State. Also, cyberattacks can be used to conduct a blockade of Member State ports, coasts or airspace,⁸⁸ while the use of a cyber-weapon to immobilize the armed forces or marine fleets of a Member State would technically fit within the Pact’s definition of aggression. This also applies where a Member State engages in acts of cyber espionage which could be used for military aggression against another Member State or provides another Member State with technological assistance of any kind such as cyber capability to conduct aggression against another Member State. In addition, a Member State that allows its territory to be used by another Member State to conduct cyberattacks against another Member State or provides support\n⁸⁵ Art. 1 AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.\n⁸⁶ See Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact [emphasis added].\n⁸⁷ Ibid.\n⁸⁸ See C.

The Council functions as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and efficient response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa.89 The Peace and Security Council, which is responsible for implementing the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact,90 is required to periodically update the Pact so as to enhance its implementation in light of contemporary security challenges.91 While the Council has not carried out any update to reflect cyber-security challenges such as State sponsored cyber operations, recent developments appear to indicate that the Council is developing a position on State sponsored cyber operations. In May, 2019, the Council issued a Communiqué on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa. The Communiqué recognized \"the increasing vulnerability of the entire Continent to the growing threat of cyber-crimes/cyberattacks\".92 In particular, the Council expressed concerns that \"a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely\" and that \"increasing global threats to Cyber Security ... constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security\".93 In furtherance of these concerns, the Council requested the AU Commission to work in collaboration with the AU Department for Peace and Security, Member States and the Regional Economic Communities to expeditiously develop a Continental Cyber Security Strategy and to report back to\n89 See Art. 2, Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, Adopted by the 1st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union, Durban, 9 July 2002.\n90 See Art. 9 AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact.\n91 See Art. 21, ibid.\n92 See African Union, Communiqué Adopted by the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU) at its 850th meeting held on 20 May 2019 on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa.

Principle 38 of the Declaration prohibits Member States from interfering with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. In this regard, Principle 38 (1) of the Declaration states that:\nStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\nMore importantly, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration provides that:\nStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n⁹⁴ Ibid, at paragraph 13.\n⁹⁵ See Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. Adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights at its 65th Ordinary Session held from 21 October to 10 November 2019 in Banjul, the Gambia, <https: 2019.pdf=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 2022.=\"\" 96=\"\" a=\"\" account=\"\" africa.=\"\" africa.=\"\" and=\"\" at=\"\" be=\"\" by=\"\" cf000000=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" cf000000.=\"\" d=\"\" d:=\"\" eachpr.org=\"\" file=\"\" fles=\"\" fles-englis=\"\" for=\"\" free=\"\" freeform=\"\" gambia,=\"\" in=\"\" jbid,=\"\" krtps:=\"\" knowerper09=\"\" of=\"\" on=\"\" on%20freedom%20of%20expression_eng_2019.pdf=\"\" public=\"\" public/document=\"\" public?document=\"\" rpch=\"\" se=\"\" see=\"\" state=\"\" states=\"\" the=\"\" visual=\"\" www.achpr.org=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n257\nThus, while no provisions of the Declaration specifically address State sponsored cyber operations, the above provision of Principle 38 (2) can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt access to the Internet and critical information infrastructure in another Member State. This is because the positive obligation that is established in Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration is not specifically restricted to disruption of access to the Internet or other digital technologies within a Member State's territory. Rather, the obligation relates to \"any disruption of access\" to the Internet and other digital technologies provided that it has hindered exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. Therefore, in fulfilling the positive obligation under Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration, a Member State is required to refrain from conducting cyber operations against another Member State where such operation will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure (for example, critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education).\nIn addition, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration imposes a positive obligation on Member States not to \"condone any disruption\" of Internet access or other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population. Thus, in fulfilling the above positive obligation a Member State is not only required to refrain from conducting cyber operations that will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, but the obligation further requires a Member State to condemn and refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors that conduct cyber operations to disrupt Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, including critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education.\n## 3.5 The ECOWAS\nThe founding Treaty of the ECOWAS establishes its objectives, which include: promoting regional cooperation and integration and maintaining peace, stability and security within the region.97 In pursuance of the objectives to maintain peace, stability and security within the region, the ECOWAS adopted a Protocol on Non-Aggression in 1978, which imposes obligations on Member States to refrain from using \"force or aggression\" and \"any other means inconsistent with\" the Charter of the United Nations or Constitutive Act of the AU against the territorial integrity and political independence of\n97 See Art. 58 ECOWAS Treaty.\nUCHENNA ORJI\nother Member States.⁹⁸ The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations. However, its provisions can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 2 of the Protocol requires every Member State to “refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States”.⁹⁹ The Protocol does not define the meaning of terms such as ‘subversion’, ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’, hence resort shall be had to other definitions of those terms. ‘Subversion’ simply refers to undermining the power and authority of an established system or institution or State.¹⁰⁰ ‘Hostility’ refers to hostile or unfriendly behaviour such as acts of warfare.¹⁰¹ Similarly, ‘aggression’ refers to hostile behaviour such as the act of attacking a State.¹⁰² Thus, a broad interpretation of acts of ‘subversion’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will include State sponsored cyber operations that seek to undermine the power and authority of a Member State. This, for example, will include State sponsored online disinformation campaigns that are targeted to cause disruption and chaos within another Member State. A broad interpretation of acts of ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will also include State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure located within the territory of a Member State. In addition, fulfilment of the obligation under Article 2 of the Protocol will require Member States to condemn cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure in another Member State and also to refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors in the conduct of such operations.\nArticle 3 of the Protocol further imposes obligations on Member States to prevent foreigners resident within their territories from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other Member States.¹⁰³ A broad interpretation of this obligation in the context of cyber operations implies, for example, that Member States are required to hold foreigners resident within their territories accountable where they engage in or encourage cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State. In addition, the Protocol requires every Member State to prevent “non-resident foreigners”\n98 See Art. 1 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol (1978).\n99 See Art. 2 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol.\n100 See The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (8th Edition, 2015), p. 1491.\n101 Ibid, p. 727.\n102 Ibid, p. 28.\n103 See Art. 3 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol.\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n259\nfrom using its territory as a base for conducting or encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States. Application of this obligation in the context of cyber operations would require a Member State to refrain from providing its territory as a base to “non-resident foreigners” for the purpose of conducting cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State.\n## 3.6 The SADC\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the SADC is to safeguard peace, stability and security within the SADC region. In pursuance of this objective, the SADC adopted a Mutual Defence Protocol in August, 2003. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations; however, Article 8 of the Protocol can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 8 of the Protocol provides that: “State parties undertake not to nurture, harbour or support any person, group of persons or institutions whose aim is to destabilize the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party”. Article 2 of the Protocol defines the term destabilize as:\nto instigate, plan, execute or assist in any of the following:\n(a) an armed attack against a State party;\n(b) sabotage aimed at the people of a State Party or an asset of a State party, whether inside or outside the territory of the State party; or,\n(c) any act or activity aimed at changing the constitutional order of a State Party through unconstitutional mean.¹⁰⁴\nIn light of the above definition of destabilization, a broad interpretation of Article 8 of the Protocol would require, for example, that a State Party is to refrain from nurturing, harbouring, instigating or supporting any person, group of persons or institutions that seek to carry out cyber operations with the aim of disrupting or sabotaging national critical information infrastructure with a view to destabilizing the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party. The SADC has also recognized a connection between cybersecurity and regional instability. For example, in 2004, the SADC Strategic Plan on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation recognized the need to build capacity to combat cybercrime and terrorism in\n¹⁰⁴ See Art. 2 SADC Mutual Defense Protocol (2003).\nUCHENNA ORJI\norder to protect the region against instability arising from intrastate conflicts and aggression.¹⁰⁵\n## 4 Identifying National Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nOnly a few African countries have considered issues relating to cyber conflict in their laws and policies on national security and cybersecurity. In most cases, such issues have been highlighted briefly in laws and policy instruments without providing clear definitions or national doctrines. For example, in Ghana, the Cybersecurity Act provides for the establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority which will be responsible “for taking measures in response to cybersecurity incidents that occur within and outside the country which may threaten national security; the defence of the country; the economy of the country; [and] international relations between the State and other countries”. However, aside from this provision, Ghana has not established a clear national doctrine that addresses cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Malawi, the National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes the development of a cybersecurity contingency plan that will include the role of the military during cyberattacks and emergencies.¹⁰⁶ The Strategy also proposes the development of a Cyber Defence Strategy that establishes approaches to addressing national security threats in cyberspace.¹⁰⁷ The Strategy further grants the military a prominent role in the management of cybersecurity incidents. In this regard, the Strategy provides that the Malawi Defence Force in collaboration with the Malawi Computer Emergency Response Team “will continuously monitor the cyberspace sphere to identify and address cyber threats and risks to the National Security of Malawi”.¹⁰⁸ However, aside from the above declarations in Malawi’s National Cybersecurity Strategy, the country is yet to develop a clear national doctrine that addresses State sponsored cyber operations or acts of aggression in cyberspace. Similarly, in Kenya, the government prescribes a broad role for the Ministry of Defence in cybersecurity governance.\n¹⁰⁵ See SADC Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (2004), p. 38.\n¹⁰⁶ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy (2019–2024), p. 16, <https: 160=\"\" api.pppc.mw=\"\" national-cybers-col.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy, p. 29.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn this regard, the Kenyan Ministry of Defence White Paper declares that \"cyber-attacks can undermine State security. [The] Ministry of Defence in collaboration with other stakeholders must develop appropriate capacity and institute measures to safeguard information systems\". However, beyond this declaration, Kenya is yet to develop the role of the military in the management of cybersecurity threats, and the country is yet to develop a policy on cyber defence or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Morocco, the military plays a prominent role in cybersecurity governance. In this regard, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has the responsibility of overseeing the development of cybersecurity and cyber defence capabilities and for ensuring the resilience and availability of the country's military operational networks. Morocco has also developed several cyber-related capabilities; however, despite the military's role in the management of cybersecurity threats, the country is yet to develop a formalized military policy or electronic on cybersecurity.\nSouth Africa appears to be the only African country that has recognized cyber warfare concerns in its national defence policy. In this regard, South Africa's Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 recognizes that \"information warfare\" including the targeting of political institutions and processes, is a national concern. In a military context, the policy classifies South African cyberspace as a \"domain\" under \"the physical control and political authority of the South African State\". The policy also classifies cybersecurity as \"a central national priority\" and further requires the Department of Defence to develop a cyber defence capability that will enhance national cyber resilience. The policy further mandates the Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to focus on cyber defence by establishing a cyber defence capability within the SANDF. However, beyond this brief recognition of information warfare in the Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, South Africa is yet to develop clear doctrines on cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n109 See Kenya Ministry of Defense, Defense White Paper (2017), p. 14.\n110 See M.

In addition, the Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy (2014) recognizes the country’s emerging opportunities in cyberspace to include exploitation of cyberspace to advance military capability in engaging external threats and conflicts. The Policy also classifies cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage and cyber conflict as major threats to Nigeria’s national security and stability.¹¹⁷\nUnder Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014), cyberspace is recognized as the fifth domain for driving critical national functions including national security and defence operations.¹¹⁸ The Strategy classifies sources of cyber threats to include foreign States and State sponsored actors and proposes to articulate an integrated containment of cyber threats including cyber conflict, violence and terror threats against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Strategy’s principle of integrated containment seeks to articulate containment measures which focus on shared responsibilities and cooperation among all State actors at the national, regional and global levels. However, the Strategy does not develop elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations, nor does it consider application of international law to cyber operations.\nRecently, the Office of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser reviewed its National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy to reflect emerging concerns on cyber threats and national security. Following the review, both the Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy are now contained in one document known as the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021). An element of the new Policy that relates to the threat of State sponsored cyber\n¹¹⁵ See Nigeria National Security Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p. 26.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n¹¹⁷ Ibid.\n¹¹⁸ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p.8, <https: cypersecurity=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" national_strategies_repository=\"\" natoria_2014_national_cybersecurity_strategy.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\noperations is the issue of foreign interference in elections. In this regard, the Policy recognizes that State and non-State actors have the potential to exert leverage on cyberspace to interfere with the electoral process including interference with elections' critical infrastructure and the conduct of cyber operations to disrupt or influence the electorate.^^ Another relevant element of the Policy is that it seeks to mainstream voluntary non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace through international awareness and engagement.^^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to adopt voluntary non-binding norms that promote responsible State behaviour and also participate in ongoing international dialogue on cyber norms. The Policy also seeks to enhance Nigeria's cyber defence capability by investing in the military to identify, prevent and repel any cyber threats to Nigeria's sovereignty and national security.^^\nThe Policy further proposes establishment of a Defence Space Administration that will coordinate the cyber activities of armed forces in defending Nigeria against cyberattacks.^^ The Defence Space Administration is meant to work with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre to develop a national cyber defence plan for Nigeria. More importantly, the proposed National Cyber Defence Plan is meant to address cross-border cyberattacks while also \"embracing requisite restraints obligated under international law\".^^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to comply with existing international law when conducting cyber operations. Thus, given that Nigeria has not earlier stated the need for an international regime to regulate States in the conduct of cyber operations, it can therefore be argued to a large extent that the Policy's recognition of \"requisite restraints obligated under international law\" appears to indicate Nigeria's position on the applicability of existing international law to cyber operations conducted by States. Therefore, it can be argued that Nigeria supports the view of the United States and Western countries that existing international law applies to cyber operations.\nHowever, pending establishment of the National Cyber Defence Plan proposed in the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), the Policy in its present form does not establish elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber\n^^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abuja, 2021), pp. 5–6.\n^^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), p. 14.\n^^ Ibid., p. 14.\n^^ Ibid., pp. 41–42.\n^^ Ibid., p. 42.\nUCHENNA ORJI\naggression or State sponsored cyber operations. Despite the absence of such doctrines, the Nigerian Army established a Cyber Warfare Command in 2018.¹²⁴ According to the Nigerian Army, the Cyber Warfare Command will be responsible for monitoring, defending and attacking subversive elements in cyberspace.¹²⁵ In 2020, the Nigerian Army Cyber Warfare Command launched its first cyber warfare exercise, which was described as Africa's first-ever cyber warfare exercise.¹²⁶ The exercise, according to the Nigerian Army, was designed to identify, track, and counter negative propaganda in social media and cyberspace.¹²⁷ However, the exercise raised human rights concerns given that it was launched during the nationwide campaign against police brutality known as the #ENDSARS campaign.¹²⁸ These concerns were further heightened by the exercise's objectives which appear to lend some credence to the view that the exercise sought to stifle online dissent during the #ENDSARS campaign.\n## 5 Challenges in Identifying African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nTo a large extent, African States and regional organizations have been absent from the ongoing international debate on norms for the governance of State behaviour in cyberspace. For example, since the commencement of the UNGGE process in 2004, only nine African countries have held its membership and such membership has been for a duration of not more than five\n¹²⁴ See K.

Thus, currently, many African States lack awareness about State sponsored cyber operations and the applicability of international law and this appears to reflect in their lack of policy and legal responses to issues in that regard. For example, no African State or regional organization has developed a robust regime on State sponsored cyber operations. Also no African State has clearly stated its position on the applicability of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations. This creates challenges in clearly identifying the position of African States on State sponsored cyber operations and therefore creates a situation where a broad interpretation of existing regimes has to be undertaken in order to attempt an identification of African positions. Also, to some extent, it may be argued that the mere participation of many African States in UNGGE processes may not really result in the easy identification of their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations if those States still lack robust cyber capabilities and basic capacities on cybersecurity governance. As such, in the absence of robust national cyber capabilities and basic cybersecurity governance capacities, the awareness that will be derived by African States following their participation in international cyber norms processes may produce little or no effect in terms of identifying their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nAnother challenge is that many African countries are still in the primary stages of tackling cybercrime and are in the process of establishing cybercrime laws, policies, and institutional frameworks. For example, as of 2021, many African countries did not have cybercrime laws, cybersecurity strategies or national Computer Emergency Response Teams.¹³⁰ There is also a lack of awareness amongst policy makers on issues relating to State sponsored cyber operations. For example, lack of awareness amongst policy makers in some countries has resulted in poor interest in funding training for cybersecurity skills due to fears over the dual use of such skills. In 2016, it was reported that\n¹²⁹ See E. Calandro and N.

Lack of awareness and funding is also caused by the fact that cybersecurity issues including the threat of State sponsored cyber operations is not really considered as a national security priority in many African States.¹³² This is also not unconnected with the fact that many African States face physical national security challenges such as terrorism which policy makers usually consider more pervasive than cybersecurity challenges.¹³³\n## 6 Conclusion\nWhile African regional organizations and States have established regional and national legal and policy measures to promote norms for cybersecurity governance, those measures largely focus on cybercrime control and cybersecurity governance. Although such measures show the willingness of African States to promote cyber stability, they do not address concerns relating to State\n¹³¹ See N.K.

As such, there are growing concerns that State sponsored cyber operations can harm the critical infrastructure and information systems of other States. In Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. However, to a large extent the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. However, an inquiry has not been undertaken to identify emerging African positions on international law and State sponsored cyber operations. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to inquire into emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations within the context of international law. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter will further consider challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n* Asst.

Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”.² Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations. Thus, cyberspace has extended the battlefield and is viewed as the fifth battle space alongside the more traditional domains such as land, air, sea and space.\nIn furtherance of the above view, some States and international military organizations have developed defence doctrines which recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. For example, in 1999, the United States Department of Defense Report on the Legal Issues of Information Operations observed that there is “an obvious military interest in being able to interfere with an adversary’s information systems, and in being able to protect one’s own”.³ In 2010, the United States Department of Defense recognized cyberspace as a UCHENNA ORJI domain of warfare.⁴ The United States Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace which was launched in July, 2011 recognizes that cyberspace, despite being a man-made domain, “is now a relevant domain for DoD activities as the naturally occurring domains of land, sea, air, and space”.⁵ Accordingly, the United States DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace declares that “the DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace’s potential”.⁶ In 2011, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the United Kingdom recognized that “cyberspace has now grown to become a domain where strategic advantage – industrial or military – can be won or lost”.⁷ Similarly, in 2011, the Russian Federation Armed Forces’ Information Space Activities Concept recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations.⁸ The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept appears to largely classify cyberspace with the term “information space”. It defines “Military conflict in the information space” as “a form of interstate or intra-state conflicts with the use of information weapons”.⁹ The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept also defines “Information War” as: the confrontation between two or more states in the information space with the purpose of inflicting damage to information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining the political, economic and social systems, a massive psychological manipulation of the population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force.¹⁰\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2016, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) during its Warsaw Summit recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare.¹³ In this regard, the NATO Cyber Pledge which was adopted at the Summit pledges to ensure that Member States are “capable of defending themselves in cyberspace as in the air, on land and at sea”.¹⁴ Therefore, cyberattacks with demonstrated aggressive intentions can trigger the collective security mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.¹⁵ With the recognition of cyberspace as a domain of warfare, there have been growing concerns over the potential of State cyber operations to endanger international peace and security. This has prompted several calls to promote stability in cyberspace through the establishment of norms and legal regimes that promote responsible behaviour by States in cyberspace. Such calls led UCHENNA ORJI the United Nations (UN) to convene a Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States” and also to propose measures to address them. The UNGGE addressed issues relating to cyber operations by States and recommended that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law which intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public.¹⁶ This recommendation is, however, not legally binding on States, but rather provides a framework of international best practices that States should consider with a view to promoting cyber stability.\nIn Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa, however, appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. This chapter seeks to identify emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter further considers challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nThe chapter is divided into five sections. The first section is this introduction. The second section discusses the concept of State Sponsored Cyber Operations and Cyber Stability and also considers international law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations. It addresses the threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations in Africa. The third section identifies African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations by considering the provisions of African regional instruments such as the African Union Constitutive Act, African Union Declarations, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the African Union Non-Aggression Pact, the ECOWAS Protocol on Non-Aggression, and the SADC ¹⁶ See UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174 (22 July 2015), 8 at paragraph 13(f).\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 2 State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nIn simple terms, State sponsored cyber operations refer to cyberattacks that are conducted by a State to disrupt or exploit the computer systems of a targeted State or cause harm to the computer systems and critical infrastructure of the targeted State with the objective of gaining an advantage over the targeted State. Such attacks may be conducted directly by a State through its institutions or through a non-State proxy with the support of a State. Targets of State sponsored cyber operations are usually critical infrastructure. However, all forms of computing devices connected to information networks are also potential targets of State sponsored cyber operations.\nState sponsored cyber operations can be executed through malicious cyber activities such as: the deployment of viruses, computer worms and malware that can disrupt and harm critical infrastructure; the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices; the use of hacking to steal critical data from institutions, governments and businesses; the use of ransomware to hold critical computer systems hostage; the use of cyber espionage to access national security information; and the use of online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within a country.\nA distinctive feature of State sponsored cyber operations is that they are generally cheaper than traditional military operations and can be carried out even by small States that may lack the technological capacities to carry out attacks. Such States can compensate for their disadvantage by hiring proxies. Therefore, at comparatively low risk and cost, significant damage and disruption can be inflicted on the intended target with little fear of reprisal given the challenges of attributing attacks to a particular individual or entity in cyberspace. Due to the challenge of attribution, State actors, criminal actors or non-State actors can loop through different computer systems in the process of perpetrating cyberattacks or even orchestrate attacks to appear to originate from government computers in another country. Thus, the problem of\nUCHENNA ORJI\nattribution creates uncertainty in identifying the origin of cyberattacks or the motive behind such attacks.¹⁷ As such, the nature of cyberspace gives disproportionate power to small and relatively insignificant malicious actors who can easily target foreign countries with a high degree of anonymity.¹⁸\nSeveral reported cyber incidents have been classified as State sponsored cyber operations. For example, in May, 2007, Estonia experienced a series of massive and coordinated cyberattacks which targeted the country's public and private critical information infrastructure.¹⁹ The attacks deployed botnets of one over million computers located in over 50 countries around the world²⁰ and the incident – classified as the world's first cyber war – is linked to Russia.²¹ In 2008, during the brief Russian-Georgia conflict, Georgia alleged that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against its government.²² Similar attacks were also launched against Georgia in 2019.²³ The 2010 Stuxnet attack which targeted and destroyed Iran's nuclear centrifuges was reported to be a joint cyber operation between the United States and Israel code-named Olympic Games.²⁴ In 2015, it was alleged that Russia had launched cyberattacks against Ukraine.²⁵\n¹⁷ See U.J.

Therefore, the concept of cyber stability is used to classify measures that aim to prevent or minimize conflict between actors, including States, in cyberspace. As such, the concept aims to minimize threats and conduct that can escalate tensions between States in cyberspace. However, despite the above definitions of cyber stability, the concept is to a large extent regarded as an emerging concept that has not yet been developed as an analytic category.33 Attempts have also been made to define an African view of cyber stability that is distinguishable from the global view.34 In this regard, it has been argued that in many ways the global views of cyber stability in dominant literature do not apply to African States and that the dominant views of cyber stability which promote regulatory openness, interoperability and global integration have been argued as differing from the views of African countries, which consider that global integration can bring instability through dependence.35 This argument may hold to the extent that many African States promote the idea of national self-sufficiency and independence in the development of information communications infrastructure so as to prevent digital colonialism and dependence on technologically advanced countries.36 However, that argument does not hold in the context of promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, because African States have taken steps to establish AFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS regional and national measures to promote cybersecurity governance in compliance with global standards. For example, African States have established regional treaties to promote cybersecurity governance such as the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection³⁷ and the ECOWAS Directive on Fighting Cybercrime,³⁸ which both require Member States to establish legal measures to criminalize and control cybercrimes and also establish frameworks for international cooperation on cybercrime.³⁹ In addition, some African States are parties to international treaties such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime⁴⁰ through which they participate in the Convention's extensive international cooperation framework and provide or receive mutual assistance from Western and non-Western countries that are parties to the Convention.⁴¹ These African developments tend towards regional and global integration in cybersecurity governance arrangements and challenge the argument that African States consider that global integration can bring instability through dependency.\nIn more practical terms, the concept of cyber stability aims to promote responsible State behaviour with a view to addressing the security challenges of the information society. This for example requires States to establish appropriate legal, policy and regulatory measures to protect cyber users and cyber infrastructure within their jurisdiction, and also ensure that cyber activities which are conducted within their jurisdiction do not cause harm to other individuals or infrastructure in another jurisdiction. The need to promote cyber stability arises from the increasing interconnectedness of national information communication networks in different countries. This has ushered in a new age of network interdependence where the security of each country's network is UCHENNA ORJI also dependent on the actions of State and non-State actors around the world. Thus, in this state of network interdependence, malicious cyber activities can have trans-boundary effects. Hence, malicious cyber activities which are conducted in a particular State can harm individuals or infrastructure located in another State. This also has potential to affect relations between States in a manner that can endanger international peace and security. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability requires States to maintain governance responsibility over cyber activities on their territory and refrain from cyber activities that can cause harm to persons or infrastructure in other States.\nThe concept of cyber stability enshrines elements of the international principles of trans-boundary harm and State responsibility. These principles were recognized in different contexts in the Corfu Channel Case, where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that a State may not\"allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\",[42] and in the Trail Smelter Case, where it was held that\"no State has right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein\".[43] These principles also exist in international telecommunications law. For example, Article 38.5 of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) requires Member States not to cause harm to the operation of telecommunications in other States. Thus, it declares that\"Member States recognize the necessity of taking practical measures to prevent the operation of electrical apparatus and installations of all kinds from disrupting the operation of telecommunication installations within the jurisdiction of other Member States\".[44] ## 2.2 International Law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations Calls for norms and legal regimes to govern the conduct of States with respect to cyber activities that can endanger international peace and security have sought to promote cyber stability by proposing the establishment of rules to ensure responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. Such calls have led to AFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS the establishment of international initiatives to promote cyber stability. In this regard, issues concerning international cyber stability were first placed on the agenda of the UN by the Russian Federation in 1998 when it proposed UN General Assembly Resolution 53/70 on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was adopted without vote on 4 December, 1998⁴⁷ following a recommendation of the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security.⁴⁸ Since then, that Resolution has been repeated annually.⁴⁹ In particular, the Resolution noted the need to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, and expressed concerns that information technologies “can potentially be used for purposes that are consistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States”.⁵⁰ Subsequently, between 2004 and 2017, the United Nations convened the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs [information and communication technologies] by States” and also propose measures to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence building measures.⁵¹ In particular, the third UN GGE⁵² made several landmark conclusions, including that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity UCHENNA ORJI contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages or impairs the operation of critical infrastructure used to provide services to the public.53 It also concluded that “international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”.54 Other significant conclusions that were reached by the third UN GGE include that: (a) State sovereignty and international norms and principles which flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory;55 (b) States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts and must also ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs, and that States must meet their obligations for internationally wrongful acts attributable to them.56 However, while the UN GGE’s reports are not legally binding, their recommendations carry significant influence in shaping global cyber-security governance, as they can provide a basis for developing rules to promote responsible cyber conduct by States.\nAlso between 2009 and 2012, the Tallinn based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre convened an international group of distinguished international law academics to study how international law applies to cyber operations conducted by States.57 The study resulted in the publication of an academic and non-binding treatise known as the Tallinn Manual in 201358 with a second edition in 2017.59 The Manual generally advances the position that principles of existing international law apply to cyber operations without the need for new international legal regimes. However, while the United States and many Western countries support the view that existing international law applies to cyber operations without the need for new international\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 2.3 Africa and the Threat of State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nAfrica comprises 55 sovereign States and is classified as the world's second largest and second most populous continent after Asia, with a terrestrial mass of 30, 2044,049 million square kilometres and a human population of over one billion people.⁶² The continent has five geographical sub-regions, comprising: Southern Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, and West Africa. The African Union (AU) is the most prominent regional intergovernmental organization that unites African States and it comprises 55 sovereign States.⁶³ Other notable intergovernmental organizations that operate within Africa's sub-regions include: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)⁶⁴ which comprises 19 Member States, the Economic Community of West African West States (ECOWAS)⁶⁵ which comprises 15 Member States, the Southern African Development Community (SADC)⁶⁶ which comprises 16 Member States and the East African Community (EAC) which comprises six States.\nThe increasing penetration of ICTs in Africa⁶⁷ has been followed with their growing integration in critical national sectors.⁶⁸ For example, banking and financial services sectors in African States are increasingly integrating ICTs to enhance service delivery and improve consumer satisfaction.⁶⁹ Also, across\n⁶⁰ See E.

For example, in January, 2018, China denied that the computer network equipment it had supplied to the AU allowed it to access confidential information from the AU.73 In June 2020, following a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam being built on the Nile River, it was reported that Egyptian hackers had launched cyberattacks on a number of Ethiopian websites.74 In December, 2020, it was reported that Chinese hackers had been accessing the security footage from cameras installed at the AU headquarters. Also in December, 2020, it was reported that Facebook found that\nApplications (2012), pp. 145-150; M. Andrianaivo and Kangni Kpodar, 'ICT, Financial Inclusion, and Growth: Evidence from African Countries', WP/11/73 IMF Working Paper, (2011), pp. 4-41.\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS Russians and individuals affiliated with the French military were using fake Facebook accounts to conduct information operations in Africa.75 Already, several African States and regional organizations have established legal measures to promote cybersecurity governance. For example, in 2011, the ECOWAS adopted a Directive to fight cybercrime within the ECOWAS region.76 Also in 2011, COMESA developed a Model Cybercrime Bill with a view to providing a uniform framework that would serve as a guide for the development of cybercrime laws in Member States.77 In 2012, the SADC adopted a Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime to serve as a guide for the development of cybersecurity laws in SADC Member States.78 In 2014, the AU adopted the Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection to harmonize the laws of African States on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control.79 To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa has been on curbing cybercrime and it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace by African States. However, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n## 3 Identifying African Regional Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations African regional organizations have legal instruments on cybersecurity such as the ECOWAS Directive on Cybercrime, the COMESA Model Cybercrime Bill, the SADC Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime, the AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection and the ECOWAS Cybersecurity Strategy. However, these instruments only focus on cybersecurity governance and cybercrime control and have not explicitly addressed State sponsored UCHENNA ORJI operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional instruments and declarations that could indicate emerging positions on State sponsored cyber operations. Such instruments and declarations exist within the framework of African regional organizations such as the AU, the ECOWAS, and the SADC and will now be discussed.\n## 3.1 The Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU) The Constitutive Act sets down the Objectives of the Union, which include inter alia to:\"promote peace, security, and stability on the continent\". In furtherance of its objectives, the AU establishes a range of governing principles which include: the establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent; a prohibition of the use of force or threat to use force among Member States of the Union; non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another; the right of Member States to live and coexist in peace and security; and rejection of acts of impunity, acts of terrorism and subversive activities. These principles in the AU Constitutive Act do not expressly mention cyber stability; however, they can be broadly interpreted as accommodating recent developments that affect cyber stability. For example, acts that affect the peace, security and stability of African States in contemporary times include State sponsored cyber operations that target critical national infrastructure and data. As such, the above principles of the AU Constitutive Act impose broad positive obligations on Member States to refrain from engaging in acts that will affect the peace, security and stability of Africa regardless of whether such acts were conducted offline or through cyberspace.\nIt is also possible for the AU principle on the prohibition of non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another Member State could be violated by State sponsored cyber operations that seek to use hacking operations or online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within an African State. This would apply to instances where a Member State uses hacking operations to influence the election outcome in another Member State or where a Member State uses online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption within another Member State with the objective of achieving a negative state of affairs in the targeted State. In addition, the AU principle on the prohibition of subversive activities would broadly apply to acts of subversion carried out through the cyberspace by a Member State against another Member State. For example, cyberspace can be used to spread disinformation or hate speech with the aim of creating dissension and destabilizing a Member State. Therefore, the principle of prohibition of subversive activities establishes broad positive obligations that would require a Member State to prevent its AFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS territory and resources from being used to encourage or commit acts of subversion against another Member State through cyberspace.\n## 3.2 The AU Non-aggression and Common Defence Pact⁸⁰ The AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact was adopted in 2005 and seeks “to put an end to conflicts of any kind within and among States in Africa in order to create conditions for socio-economic development and integration of the continent as well as the fulfilment of the aspirations of [African] peoples”.⁸¹ The Pact entered into force on 18 December 2009 after its ratification by 15 AU Member States. As of August, 2021, 44 AU Member States had signed the Pact, while 22 Member States had ratified it.⁸² To a large extent, the Pact is regarded as containing by far “the most elaborate political commitment of African States not to commit aggression against each other”.⁸³ The Pact elaborately defines ‘aggression’ as “the use, intentionally, and knowingly, of armed force or any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity, against the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and human security of the population of a State party to this Pact, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations or the Constitutive Act of the African Union...”.⁸⁴ Some elements of the above definition of aggression appear to create broad scope for classifying hostile cyber operations conducted by a Member State against another Member State within the meaning of aggression. For example, the Pact does not restrict the definition of aggression to the use of ‘armed force’, but includes ‘any other hostile act’ conducted by a State or non-State actor against the ‘sovereignty’ and ‘human security’ of the population of a Member State. In modern times, hostile acts against the sovereignty of a State would include disruption of its critical information infrastructure, ⁸⁰ See U.J.

This is because hostile acts that violate the sovereignty of a State would include attacks that target its critical information infrastructure, given the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.\nIn addition, specific acts that constitute ‘acts of aggression’ (regardless of a declaration of war) under the Pact include: the use of any weapon against the territory of a Member State; the blockade of the ports, coasts or airspace of a Member State; the action of a Member State in allowing its territory to be used by another Member State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; and technological assistance of any kind, intelligence and training to another State for use in committing acts of aggression against another Member State.⁸⁷ Thus, the above elements that exist within the definition of aggression provide broad scope for considering the Pact as a framework that applies to State cyber operations. For example, ‘any weapon’ within the context of the Pact would technically include a cyber-weapon such as malware, given that such a weapon can be used to execute an attack against critical information infrastructure located in the territory of a Member State. Also, cyberattacks can be used to conduct a blockade of Member State ports, coasts or airspace,⁸⁸ while the use of a cyber-weapon to immobilize the armed forces or marine fleets of a Member State would technically fit within the Pact’s definition of aggression. This also applies where a Member State engages in acts of cyber espionage which could be used for military aggression against another Member State or provides another Member State with technological assistance of any kind such as cyber capability to conduct aggression against another Member State. In addition, a Member State that allows its territory to be used by another Member State to conduct cyberattacks against another Member State or provides support ⁸⁵ Art. 1 AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.\n⁸⁶ See Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact [emphasis added].\n⁸⁷ Ibid.\n⁸⁸ See C.

The Council functions as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and efficient response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa.89 The Peace and Security Council, which is responsible for implementing the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact,90 is required to periodically update the Pact so as to enhance its implementation in light of contemporary security challenges.91 While the Council has not carried out any update to reflect cyber-security challenges such as State sponsored cyber operations, recent developments appear to indicate that the Council is developing a position on State sponsored cyber operations. In May, 2019, the Council issued a Communiqué on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa. The Communiqué recognized \"the increasing vulnerability of the entire Continent to the growing threat of cyber-crimes/cyberattacks\".92 In particular, the Council expressed concerns that \"a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely\" and that \"increasing global threats to Cyber Security ... constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security\".93 In furtherance of these concerns, the Council requested the AU Commission to work in collaboration with the AU Department for Peace and Security, Member States and the Regional Economic Communities to expeditiously develop a Continental Cyber Security Strategy and to report back to\n\nUCHENNA ORJI the Council before the 2020 Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government.⁹⁴ However, while to some extent the above statements indicate the Council's emerging position on State cyber operations, the proposed AU Continental Cyber Security Strategy is yet to be developed to clearly express the AU's position on State cyber operations.\n## 3.4 Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa In November 2019, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights adopted the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa.⁹⁵ The Declaration was adopted pursuant to Article 45(1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, which mandates the African Commission to promote human and peoples' rights by formulating principles and rules to address legal problems relating to human and peoples' rights and fundamental freedoms upon which African States may base their legislation.⁹⁶ The Declaration affirms the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and access to information enshrined in Article 9 of the African Charter. Principle 38 of the Declaration prohibits Member States from interfering with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. In this regard, Principle 38 (1) of the Declaration states that: States shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\nMore importantly, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration provides that: States shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n⁹⁴ Ibid, at paragraph 13.\n⁹⁵ See Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. Adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights at its 65th Ordinary Session held from 21 October to 10 November 2019 in Banjul, the Gambia, <https: 2019.pdf=\"\"2022.=\"\"2022.=\"\"96=\"\"a=\"\"account=\"\"africa.=\"\"africa.=\"\"and=\"\"at=\"\"be=\"\"by=\"\"cf000000=\"\"cf000000.=\"\"cf000000.=\"\"d=\"\"d:=\"\"eachpr.org=\"\"file=\"\"fles=\"\"fles-englis=\"\"for=\"\"free=\"\"freeform=\"\"gambia,=\"\"in=\"\"jbid,=\"\"krtps:=\"\"knowerper09=\"\"of=\"\"on=\"\"on%20freedom%20of%20expression_eng_2019.pdf=\"\"public=\"\"public/document=\"\"public?document=\"\"rpch=\"\"se=\"\"see=\"\"state=\"\"states=\"\"the=\"\"visual=\"\"www.achpr.org=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:> AFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS In addition, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration imposes a positive obligation on Member States not to\"condone any disruption\"of Internet access or other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population. Thus, in fulfilling the above positive obligation a Member State is not only required to refrain from conducting cyber operations that will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, but the obligation further requires a Member State to condemn and refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors that conduct cyber operations to disrupt Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, including critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education.\n## 3.5 The ECOWAS The founding Treaty of the ECOWAS establishes its objectives, which include: promoting regional cooperation and integration and maintaining peace, stability and security within the region.97 In pursuance of the objectives to maintain peace, stability and security within the region, the ECOWAS adopted a Protocol on Non-Aggression in 1978, which imposes obligations on Member States to refrain from using\"force or aggression\"and\"any other means inconsistent with\"the Charter of the United Nations or Constitutive Act of the AU against the territorial integrity and political independence of UCHENNA ORJI other Member States.⁹⁸ The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations. However, its provisions can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 2 of the Protocol requires every Member State to “refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States”.⁹⁹ The Protocol does not define the meaning of terms such as ‘subversion’, ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’, hence resort shall be had to other definitions of those terms. ‘Subversion’ simply refers to undermining the power and authority of an established system or institution or State.¹⁰⁰ ‘Hostility’ refers to hostile or unfriendly behaviour such as acts of warfare.¹⁰¹ Similarly, ‘aggression’ refers to hostile behaviour such as the act of attacking a State.¹⁰² Thus, a broad interpretation of acts of ‘subversion’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will include State sponsored cyber operations that seek to undermine the power and authority of a Member State. This, for example, will include State sponsored online disinformation campaigns that are targeted to cause disruption and chaos within another Member State. A broad interpretation of acts of ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will also include State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure located within the territory of a Member State. In addition, fulfilment of the obligation under Article 2 of the Protocol will require Member States to condemn cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure in another Member State and also to refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors in the conduct of such operations.\nArticle 3 of the Protocol further imposes obligations on Member States to prevent foreigners resident within their territories from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other Member States.¹⁰³ A broad interpretation of this obligation in the context of cyber operations implies, for example, that Member States are required to hold foreigners resident within their territories accountable where they engage in or encourage cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State. In addition, the Protocol requires every Member State to prevent “non-resident foreigners”\n\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 3.6 The SADC\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the SADC is to safeguard peace, stability and security within the SADC region. In pursuance of this objective, the SADC adopted a Mutual Defence Protocol in August, 2003. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations; however, Article 8 of the Protocol can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 8 of the Protocol provides that: “State parties undertake not to nurture, harbour or support any person, group of persons or institutions whose aim is to destabilize the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party”. Article 2 of the Protocol defines the term destabilize as:\nto instigate, plan, execute or assist in any of the following:\n(a) an armed attack against a State party;\n(b) sabotage aimed at the people of a State Party or an asset of a State party, whether inside or outside the territory of the State party; or,\n(c) any act or activity aimed at changing the constitutional order of a State Party through unconstitutional mean.¹⁰⁴\nIn light of the above definition of destabilization, a broad interpretation of Article 8 of the Protocol would require, for example, that a State Party is to refrain from nurturing, harbouring, instigating or supporting any person, group of persons or institutions that seek to carry out cyber operations with the aim of disrupting or sabotaging national critical information infrastructure with a view to destabilizing the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party. The SADC has also recognized a connection between cybersecurity and regional instability. For example, in 2004, the SADC Strategic Plan on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation recognized the need to build capacity to combat cybercrime and terrorism in\n¹⁰⁴ See Art. 2 SADC Mutual Defense Protocol (2003).\nUCHENNA ORJI\norder to protect the region against instability arising from intrastate conflicts and aggression.¹⁰⁵\n## 4 Identifying National Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations\nOnly a few African countries have considered issues relating to cyber conflict in their laws and policies on national security and cybersecurity. In most cases, such issues have been highlighted briefly in laws and policy instruments without providing clear definitions or national doctrines. For example, in Ghana, the Cybersecurity Act provides for the establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority which will be responsible “for taking measures in response to cybersecurity incidents that occur within and outside the country which may threaten national security; the defence of the country; the economy of the country; [and] international relations between the State and other countries”. However, aside from this provision, Ghana has not established a clear national doctrine that addresses cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Malawi, the National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes the development of a cybersecurity contingency plan that will include the role of the military during cyberattacks and emergencies.¹⁰⁶ The Strategy also proposes the development of a Cyber Defence Strategy that establishes approaches to addressing national security threats in cyberspace.¹⁰⁷ The Strategy further grants the military a prominent role in the management of cybersecurity incidents. In this regard, the Strategy provides that the Malawi Defence Force in collaboration with the Malawi Computer Emergency Response Team “will continuously monitor the cyberspace sphere to identify and address cyber threats and risks to the National Security of Malawi”.¹⁰⁸ However, aside from the above declarations in Malawi’s National Cybersecurity Strategy, the country is yet to develop a clear national doctrine that addresses State sponsored cyber operations or acts of aggression in cyberspace. Similarly, in Kenya, the government prescribes a broad role for the Ministry of Defence in cybersecurity governance.\n¹⁰⁵ See SADC Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (2004), p. 38.\n¹⁰⁶ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy (2019–2024), p. 16, <https: 160=\"\" api.pppc.mw=\"\" national-cybers-col.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy, p. 29.</https:>\nAFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn this regard, the Kenyan Ministry of Defence White Paper declares that \"cyber-attacks can undermine State security. [The] Ministry of Defence in collaboration with other stakeholders must develop appropriate capacity and institute measures to safeguard information systems\".[109] However, beyond this declaration, Kenya is yet to develop the role of the military in the management of cybersecurity threats, and the country is yet to develop a policy on cyber defence or State sponsored cyber operations.\nIn Morocco, the military plays a prominent role in cybersecurity governance. In this regard, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has the responsibility of overseeing the development of cybersecurity and cyber defence capabilities and for ensuring the resilience and availability of the country's military operational networks.[110] Morocco has also developed several cyber-related capabilities; however, despite the military's role in the management of cybersecurity threats, the country is yet to develop a formalized military policy or electronic on cybersecurity.[111]\nSouth Africa appears to be the only African country that has recognized cyber warfare concerns in its national defence policy. In this regard, South Africa's Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 recognizes that \"information warfare\" including the targeting of political institutions and processes, is a national concern.[112] In a military context, the policy classifies South African cyberspace as a \"domain\" under \"the physical control and political authority of the South African State\".[113] The policy also classifies cybersecurity as \"a central national priority\" and further requires the Department of Defence to develop a cyber defence capability that will enhance national cyber resilience.[114] The policy further mandates the Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to focus on cyber defence by establishing a cyber defence capability within the SANDF. However, beyond this brief recognition of information warfare in the Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, South Africa is yet to develop clear doctrines on cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n\nUCHENNA ORJI In Nigeria, the National Security Strategy recognizes that “cyber threats are inherently asymmetrical with an increasing range of actors engaged in espionage and warfare”.¹¹⁵ The Strategy also classifies four major cyber threats with significant capability to damage Nigeria’s national security and economy to include: cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and “cyber conflict”.¹¹⁶ The Strategy further proposes development of a national strategic framework dedicated to cyber defence including capacity building programmes for the military. In addition, the Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy (2014) recognizes the country’s emerging opportunities in cyberspace to include exploitation of cyberspace to advance military capability in engaging external threats and conflicts. The Policy also classifies cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage and cyber conflict as major threats to Nigeria’s national security and stability.¹¹⁷ Under Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014), cyberspace is recognized as the fifth domain for driving critical national functions including national security and defence operations.¹¹⁸ The Strategy classifies sources of cyber threats to include foreign States and State sponsored actors and proposes to articulate an integrated containment of cyber threats including cyber conflict, violence and terror threats against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Strategy’s principle of integrated containment seeks to articulate containment measures which focus on shared responsibilities and cooperation among all State actors at the national, regional and global levels. However, the Strategy does not develop elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations, nor does it consider application of international law to cyber operations.\nRecently, the Office of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser reviewed its National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy to reflect emerging concerns on cyber threats and national security. Following the review, both the Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy are now contained in one document known as the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021). An element of the new Policy that relates to the threat of State sponsored cyber ¹¹⁵ See Nigeria National Security Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p. 26.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n¹¹⁷ Ibid.\n¹¹⁸ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Strategy, (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abjua, 2014), p.8, <https: cypersecurity=\"\"en=\"\"documents=\"\"national_strategies_repository=\"\"natoria_2014_national_cybersecurity_strategy.pdf=\"\"www.itu.int=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.</https:> AFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS operations is the issue of foreign interference in elections. In this regard, the Policy recognizes that State and non-State actors have the potential to exert leverage on cyberspace to interfere with the electoral process including interference with elections' critical infrastructure and the conduct of cyber operations to disrupt or influence the electorate.^[119]^ Another relevant element of the Policy is that it seeks to mainstream voluntary non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace through international awareness and engagement.^[120]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to adopt voluntary non-binding norms that promote responsible State behaviour and also participate in ongoing international dialogue on cyber norms. The Policy also seeks to enhance Nigeria's cyber defence capability by investing in the military to identify, prevent and repel any cyber threats to Nigeria's sovereignty and national security.^[121]^ The Policy further proposes establishment of a Defence Space Administration that will coordinate the cyber activities of armed forces in defending Nigeria against cyberattacks.^[122]^ The Defence Space Administration is meant to work with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre to develop a national cyber defence plan for Nigeria. More importantly, the proposed National Cyber Defence Plan is meant to address cross-border cyberattacks while also\"embracing requisite restraints obligated under international law\".^[123]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to comply with existing international law when conducting cyber operations. Thus, given that Nigeria has not earlier stated the need for an international regime to regulate States in the conduct of cyber operations, it can therefore be argued to a large extent that the Policy's recognition of\"requisite restraints obligated under international law\"appears to indicate Nigeria's position on the applicability of existing international law to cyber operations conducted by States. Therefore, it can be argued that Nigeria supports the view of the United States and Western countries that existing international law applies to cyber operations.\nHowever, pending establishment of the National Cyber Defence Plan proposed in the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), the Policy in its present form does not establish elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber ^[119]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abuja, 2021), pp. 5–6.\n^[120]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), p. 14.\n^[121]^ Ibid., p. 14.\n^[122]^ Ibid., pp. 41–42.\n^[123]^ Ibid., p. 42.\nUCHENNA ORJI aggression or State sponsored cyber operations. Despite the absence of such doctrines, the Nigerian Army established a Cyber Warfare Command in 2018.¹²⁴ According to the Nigerian Army, the Cyber Warfare Command will be responsible for monitoring, defending and attacking subversive elements in cyberspace.¹²⁵ In 2020, the Nigerian Army Cyber Warfare Command launched its first cyber warfare exercise, which was described as Africa's first-ever cyber warfare exercise.¹²⁶ The exercise, according to the Nigerian Army, was designed to identify, track, and counter negative propaganda in social media and cyberspace.¹²⁷ However, the exercise raised human rights concerns given that it was launched during the nationwide campaign against police brutality known as the #ENDSARS campaign.¹²⁸ These concerns were further heightened by the exercise's objectives which appear to lend some credence to the view that the exercise sought to stifle online dissent during the #ENDSARS campaign.\n## 5 Challenges in Identifying African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations To a large extent, African States and regional organizations have been absent from the ongoing international debate on norms for the governance of State behaviour in cyberspace. For example, since the commencement of the UNGGE process in 2004, only nine African countries have held its membership and such membership has been for a duration of not more than five ¹²⁴ See K. Omonobi, 'Nigerian Army's Cyber Warfare Command begins operation', *Vanguard* (29 August 2018), <https: 08=\"\"2018=\"\"nigerian-army-cyber-warfare-command-begins-operation=\"\"www.vanguardngr.com=\"\"></https:>, visited on 15 February 2022.\n¹²⁵ *Ibid.* ¹²⁶ See A.

Thus, currently, many African States lack awareness about State sponsored cyber operations and the applicability of international law and this appears to reflect in their lack of policy and legal responses to issues in that regard. For example, no African State or regional organization has developed a robust regime on State sponsored cyber operations. Also no African State has clearly stated its position on the applicability of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations. This creates challenges in clearly identifying the position of African States on State sponsored cyber operations and therefore creates a situation where a broad interpretation of existing regimes has to be undertaken in order to attempt an identification of African positions. Also, to some extent, it may be argued that the mere participation of many African States in UNGGE processes may not really result in the easy identification of their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations if those States still lack robust cyber capabilities and basic capacities on cybersecurity governance. As such, in the absence of robust national cyber capabilities and basic cybersecurity governance capacities, the awareness that will be derived by African States following their participation in international cyber norms processes may produce little or no effect in terms of identifying their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\nAnother challenge is that many African countries are still in the primary stages of tackling cybercrime and are in the process of establishing cybercrime laws, policies, and institutional frameworks. For example, as of 2021, many African countries did not have cybercrime laws, cybersecurity strategies or national Computer Emergency Response Teams.¹³⁰ There is also a lack of awareness amongst policy makers on issues relating to State sponsored cyber operations. For example, lack of awareness amongst policy makers in some countries has resulted in poor interest in funding training for cybersecurity skills due to fears over the dual use of such skills. In 2016, it was reported that ¹²⁹ See E. Calandro and N. Berglund, *Bridging The Cyber Norms Debate With Evidence*, Discussion paper submitted to the UN Open Ended Working Group (OWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Communications Technology in the Context of International Security, pp. 1–3, <https: 12=\"\"2019=\"\"discussion-paper-oewg-international-meeting.pdf=\"\"ிழoloads=\"\"www.un.org=\"\"ww.gov=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n¹³⁰ See U.J.

Lack of awareness and funding is also caused by the fact that cybersecurity issues including the threat of State sponsored cyber operations is not really considered as a national security priority in many African States.¹³² This is also not unconnected with the fact that many African States face physical national security challenges such as terrorism which policy makers usually consider more pervasive than cybersecurity challenges.¹³³ ## 6 Conclusion While African regional organizations and States have established regional and national legal and policy measures to promote norms for cybersecurity governance, those measures largely focus on cybercrime control and cybersecurity governance. Although such measures show the willingness of African States to promote cyber stability, they do not address concerns relating to State ¹³¹ See N.K.

Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”.² Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations. Thus, cyberspace has extended the battlefield and is viewed as the fifth battle space alongside the more traditional domains such as land, air, sea and space.\nIn furtherance of the above view, some States and international military organizations have developed defence doctrines which recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare. For example, in 1999, the United States Department of Defense Report on the Legal Issues of Information Operations observed that there is “an obvious military interest in being able to interfere with an adversary’s information systems, and in being able to protect one’s own”.³ In 2010, the United States Department of Defense recognized cyberspace as a\n1.

It defines “Military conflict in the information space” as “a form of interstate or intra-state conflicts with the use of information weapons”.⁹ The Russian Federation’s Information Space Activities Concept also defines “Information War” as:\nthe confrontation between two or more states in the information space with the purpose of inflicting damage to information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining the political, economic and social systems, a massive psychological manipulation of the population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force.¹⁰\n4 See C.

Nevertheless, as discussed in this chapter, there exist some African regional and national legal and policy instruments that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. A broad interpretation of these legal and policy instruments in the light of the challenges of the information society, such as State sponsored cyber operations, can be used as a guide in locating probable African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. In particular, the AU Non-Aggression Pact can be broadly interpreted as constituting the common position of African countries towards State sponsored cyber operations. However, the AU Peace and Security Council in the exercise of its mandate should consider making updates to the Pact so as to clearly reflect cyber operations. In the present state of affairs in Africa, and the challenges of identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations, the question will remain largely unanswered for some time as to whether the positions of African States on the application of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations largely aligns with either the United States and Europe or with Russia and China. Thus, in the circumstances, it appears safer to conclude that most African States are still developing basic capabilities and are not yet aligned with either the views of the United States and Europe or with Russia and China towards State sponsored cyber operations.",

    "# Interrogating African Positions on State Sponsored Cyber Operations: A Review of Regional and National Policies and Legal Responses\n\nUchenna Jerome Orji*\n\n## Abstract\n\nThere is potential that cyber capabilities can be deployed by States to achieve objectives that endanger international and regional peace and security. As such, there are growing concerns that State sponsored cyber operations can harm the critical infrastructure and information systems of other States. In Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. However, to a large extent the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. However, an inquiry has not been undertaken to identify emerging African positions on international law and State sponsored cyber operations. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to inquire into emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations within the context of international law. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter will further consider challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n\n* Asst.

Malicious acts against computer systems and networks now have the potential to affect individuals, countries and the global economy in ways previously unimagined. In this regard, it has been aptly observed that, “the more technologically advanced a State is, the more vulnerable to cyberattacks: if computer networks become the ‘nerve system’ of civilian and military infrastructures, incapacitating them means paralyzing the country”.² Accordingly, cyberspace is now seen as a domain of warfare through which States can carry out military operations and achieve tactical objectives without engaging in kinetic operations.

The fourth section identifies African national positions on State sponsored cyber operations by examining legal and policy instruments on cybersecurity and national security. The fifth section highlights challenges in identifying African national positions on State sponsored cyber operations and then the conclusion follows.\n\n## 2 State Sponsored Cyber Operations\n\nIn simple terms, State sponsored cyber operations refer to cyberattacks that are conducted by a State to disrupt or exploit the computer systems of a targeted State or cause harm to the computer systems and critical infrastructure of the targeted State with the objective of gaining an advantage over the targeted State. Such attacks may be conducted directly by a State through its institutions or through a non-State proxy with the support of a State. Targets of State sponsored cyber operations are usually critical infrastructure. However, all forms of computing devices connected to information networks are also potential targets of State sponsored cyber operations.\n\nState sponsored cyber operations can be executed through malicious cyber activities such as: the deployment of viruses, computer worms and malware that can disrupt and harm critical infrastructure; the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices; the use of hacking to steal critical data from institutions, governments and businesses; the use of ransomware to hold critical computer systems hostage; the use of cyber espionage to access national security information; and the use of online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within a country.\n\nA distinctive feature of State sponsored cyber operations is that they are generally cheaper than traditional military operations and can be carried out even by small States that may lack the technological capacities to carry out attacks. Such States can compensate for their disadvantage by hiring proxies. Therefore, at comparatively low risk and cost, significant damage and disruption can be inflicted on the intended target with little fear of reprisal given the challenges of attributing attacks to a particular individual or entity in cyberspace. Due to the challenge of attribution, State actors, criminal actors or non-State actors can loop through different computer systems in the process of perpetrating cyberattacks or even orchestrate attacks to appear to originate from government computers in another country. Thus, the problem of",
    "UCHENNA ORJI\n\nattribution creates uncertainty in identifying the origin of cyberattacks or the motive behind such attacks.¹⁷ As such, the nature of cyberspace gives disproportionate power to small and relatively insignificant malicious actors who can easily target foreign countries with a high degree of anonymity.¹⁸\n\nSeveral reported cyber incidents have been classified as State sponsored cyber operations. For example, in May, 2007, Estonia experienced a series of massive and coordinated cyberattacks which targeted the country's public and private critical information infrastructure.¹⁹ The attacks deployed botnets of one over million computers located in over 50 countries around the world²⁰ and the incident – classified as the world's first cyber war – is linked to Russia.²¹ In 2008, during the brief Russian-Georgia conflict, Georgia alleged that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against its government.²² Similar attacks were also launched against Georgia in 2019.²³ The 2010 Stuxnet attack which targeted and destroyed Iran's nuclear centrifuges was reported to be a joint cyber operation between the United States and Israel code-named Olympic Games.²⁴ In 2015, it was alleged that Russia had launched cyberattacks against Ukraine.²⁵\n\n¹⁷ See U.J.

Therefore, the concept of cyber stability is used to classify measures that aim to prevent or minimize conflict between actors, including States, in cyberspace. As such, the concept aims to minimize threats and conduct that can escalate tensions between States in cyberspace. However, despite the above definitions of cyber stability, the concept is to a large extent regarded as an emerging concept that has not yet been developed as an analytic category.33\n\nAttempts have also been made to define an African view of cyber stability that is distinguishable from the global view.34 In this regard, it has been argued that in many ways the global views of cyber stability in dominant literature do not apply to African States and that the dominant views of cyber stability which promote regulatory openness, interoperability and global integration have been argued as differing from the views of African countries, which consider that global integration can bring instability through dependence.35 This argument may hold to the extent that many African States promote the idea of national self-sufficiency and independence in the development of information communications infrastructure so as to prevent digital colonialism and dependence on technologically advanced countries.36 However, that argument does not hold in the context of promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, because African States have taken steps to establish\n\n32 See International Security Advisory Board, Report on a Framework for International Cyber Stability (United States Department of State, 2 July 2014) Appendix B.1, at p. 33.\n\n33 See L.

For example, African States have established regional treaties to promote cybersecurity governance such as the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection³⁷ and the ECOWAS Directive on Fighting Cybercrime,³⁸ which both require Member States to establish legal measures to criminalize and control cybercrimes and also establish frameworks for international cooperation on cybercrime.³⁹ In addition, some African States are parties to international treaties such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime⁴⁰ through which they participate in the Convention's extensive international cooperation framework and provide or receive mutual assistance from Western and non-Western countries that are parties to the Convention.⁴¹ These African developments tend towards regional and global integration in cybersecurity governance arrangements and challenge the argument that African States consider that global integration can bring instability through dependency.\n\nIn more practical terms, the concept of cyber stability aims to promote responsible State behaviour with a view to addressing the security challenges of the information society. This for example requires States to establish appropriate legal, policy and regulatory measures to protect cyber users and cyber infrastructure within their jurisdiction, and also ensure that cyber activities which are conducted within their jurisdiction do not cause harm to other individuals or infrastructure in another jurisdiction. The need to promote cyber stability arises from the increasing interconnectedness of national information communication networks in different countries.

Thus, in this state of network interdependence, malicious cyber activities can have trans-boundary effects. Hence, malicious cyber activities which are conducted in a particular State can harm individuals or infrastructure located in another State. This also has potential to affect relations between States in a manner that can endanger international peace and security. Therefore, the concept of cyber stability requires States to maintain governance responsibility over cyber activities on their territory and refrain from cyber activities that can cause harm to persons or infrastructure in other States.\n\nThe concept of cyber stability enshrines elements of the international principles of trans-boundary harm and State responsibility. These principles were recognized in different contexts in the Corfu Channel Case, where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that a State may not \"allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\",[42] and in the Trail Smelter Case, where it was held that \"no State has right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein\".[43] These principles also exist in international telecommunications law. For example, Article 38.5 of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) requires Member States not to cause harm to the operation of telecommunications in other States. Thus, it declares that \"Member States recognize the necessity of taking practical measures to prevent the operation of electrical apparatus and installations of all kinds from disrupting the operation of telecommunication installations within the jurisdiction of other Member States\".[44]\n\n## 2.2 International Law and State Sponsored Cyber Operations\n\nCalls for norms and legal regimes to govern the conduct of States with respect to cyber activities that can endanger international peace and security $^{45}$ have sought to promote cyber stability by proposing the establishment of rules to ensure responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. $^{46}$ Such calls have led to\n\n42 See The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v.

In this regard, issues concerning international cyber stability were first placed on the agenda of the UN by the Russian Federation in 1998 when it proposed UN General Assembly Resolution 53/70 on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was adopted without vote on 4 December, 1998⁴⁷ following a recommendation of the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security.⁴⁸ Since then, that Resolution has been repeated annually.⁴⁹ In particular, the Resolution noted the need to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, and expressed concerns that information technologies “can potentially be used for purposes that are consistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States”.⁵⁰ Subsequently, between 2004 and 2017, the United Nations convened the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) to examine “existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs [information and communication technologies] by States” and also propose measures to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence building measures.⁵¹\n\nIn particular, the third UN GGE⁵² made several landmark conclusions, including that a State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity\n\n47 See UN General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n\n48 See UN General Assembly, Role of Science and Technology in the Context of Security, Disarmament and Other related Fields, Report of the First Committee, A/53/576 (18 November, 1998).\n\n49 See UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, <https: disarmament=\"\" informationsecurity=\"\" topics=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></https:>, visited on 15 February 2022.

For example, in 2011, the ECOWAS adopted a Directive to fight cybercrime within the ECOWAS region.76 Also in 2011, COMESA developed a Model Cybercrime Bill with a view to providing a uniform framework that would serve as a guide for the development of cybercrime laws in Member States.77 In 2012, the SADC adopted a Model Law on Computer Crime and Cybercrime to serve as a guide for the development of cybersecurity laws in SADC Member States.78 In 2014, the AU adopted the Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection to harmonize the laws of African States on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control.79 To a large extent, the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa has been on curbing cybercrime and it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace by African States.

Such instruments and declarations exist within the framework of African regional organizations such as the AU, the ECOWAS, and the SADC and will now be discussed.\n\n## 3.1 The Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU)\n\nThe Constitutive Act sets down the Objectives of the Union, which include inter alia to: \"promote peace, security, and stability on the continent\". In furtherance of its objectives, the AU establishes a range of governing principles which include: the establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent; a prohibition of the use of force or threat to use force among Member States of the Union; non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another; the right of Member States to live and coexist in peace and security; and rejection of acts of impunity, acts of terrorism and subversive activities. These principles in the AU Constitutive Act do not expressly mention cyber stability; however, they can be broadly interpreted as accommodating recent developments that affect cyber stability. For example, acts that affect the peace, security and stability of African States in contemporary times include State sponsored cyber operations that target critical national infrastructure and data. As such, the above principles of the AU Constitutive Act impose broad positive obligations on Member States to refrain from engaging in acts that will affect the peace, security and stability of Africa regardless of whether such acts were conducted offline or through cyberspace.\n\nIt is also possible for the AU principle on the prohibition of non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another Member State could be violated by State sponsored cyber operations that seek to use hacking operations or online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption and chaos within an African State. This would apply to instances where a Member State uses hacking operations to influence the election outcome in another Member State or where a Member State uses online disinformation campaigns to cause disruption within another Member State with the objective of achieving a negative state of affairs in the targeted State. In addition, the AU principle on the prohibition of subversive activities would broadly apply to acts of subversion carried out through the cyberspace by a Member State against another Member State. For example, cyberspace can be used to spread disinformation or hate speech with the aim of creating dissension and destabilizing a Member State. Therefore, the principle of prohibition of subversive activities establishes broad positive obligations that would require a Member State to prevent its",

As of August, 2021, 44 AU Member States had signed the Pact, while 22 Member States had ratified it.⁸² To a large extent, the Pact is regarded as containing by far “the most elaborate political commitment of African States not to commit aggression against each other”.⁸³\n\nThe Pact elaborately defines ‘aggression’ as “the use, intentionally, and knowingly, of armed force or any other hostile act by a State, a group of States, an organization of States or non-State actor(s) or by any foreign or external entity, against the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and human security of the population of a State party to this Pact, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations or the Constitutive Act of the African Union ...”.⁸⁴ Some elements of the above definition of aggression appear to create broad scope for classifying hostile cyber operations conducted by a Member State against another Member State within the meaning of aggression. For example, the Pact does not restrict the definition of aggression to the use of ‘armed force’, but includes ‘any other hostile act’ conducted by a State or non-State actor against the ‘sovereignty’ and ‘human security’ of the population of a Member State.

This is because hostile acts that violate the sovereignty of a State would include attacks that target its critical information infrastructure, given the strategic importance of such infrastructure to national security.\n\nIn addition, specific acts that constitute ‘acts of aggression’ (regardless of a declaration of war) under the Pact include: the use of any weapon against the territory of a Member State; the blockade of the ports, coasts or airspace of a Member State; the action of a Member State in allowing its territory to be used by another Member State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; and technological assistance of any kind, intelligence and training to another State for use in committing acts of aggression against another Member State.⁸⁷ Thus, the above elements that exist within the definition of aggression provide broad scope for considering the Pact as a framework that applies to State cyber operations. For example, ‘any weapon’ within the context of the Pact would technically include a cyber-weapon such as malware, given that such a weapon can be used to execute an attack against critical information infrastructure located in the territory of a Member State. Also, cyberattacks can be used to conduct a blockade of Member State ports, coasts or airspace,⁸⁸ while the use of a cyber-weapon to immobilize the armed forces or marine fleets of a Member State would technically fit within the Pact’s definition of aggression. This also applies where a Member State engages in acts of cyber espionage which could be used for military aggression against another Member State or provides another Member State with technological assistance of any kind such as cyber capability to conduct aggression against another Member State. In addition, a Member State that allows its territory to be used by another Member State to conduct cyberattacks against another Member State or provides support\n\n⁸⁵ Art. 1 AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.\n⁸⁶ See Art. 1(c), AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact [emphasis added].\n⁸⁷ Ibid.\n⁸⁸ See C.

The Council functions as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and efficient response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa.89 The Peace and Security Council, which is responsible for implementing the AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact,90 is required to periodically update the Pact so as to enhance its implementation in light of contemporary security challenges.91 While the Council has not carried out any update to reflect cyber-security challenges such as State sponsored cyber operations, recent developments appear to indicate that the Council is developing a position on State sponsored cyber operations. In May, 2019, the Council issued a Communiqué on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa. The Communiqué recognized \"the increasing vulnerability of the entire Continent to the growing threat of cyber-crimes/cyberattacks\".92 In particular, the Council expressed concerns that \"a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely\" and that \"increasing global threats to Cyber Security ... constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security\".93 In furtherance of these concerns, the Council requested the AU Commission to work in collaboration with the AU Department for Peace and Security, Member States and the Regional Economic Communities to expeditiously develop a Continental Cyber Security Strategy and to report back to\n\n89 See Art. 2, Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, Adopted by the 1st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union, Durban, 9 July 2002.\n90 See Art. 9 AU Non-Aggression and Common Defense Pact.\n91 See Art. 21, ibid.\n92 See African Union, Communiqué Adopted by the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU) at its 850th meeting held on 20 May 2019 on Mitigating the Threats of Cyber Security to Peace and Security in Africa.

Principle 38 of the Declaration prohibits Member States from interfering with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. In this regard, Principle 38 (1) of the Declaration states that:\n\nStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\n\nMore importantly, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration provides that:\n\nStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n\n⁹⁴ Ibid, at paragraph 13.\n\n⁹⁵ See Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa.

This is because the positive obligation that is established in Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration is not specifically restricted to disruption of access to the Internet or other digital technologies within a Member State's territory. Rather, the obligation relates to \"any disruption of access\" to the Internet and other digital technologies provided that it has hindered exercise of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. Therefore, in fulfilling the positive obligation under Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration, a Member State is required to refrain from conducting cyber operations against another Member State where such operation will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure (for example, critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education).\n\nIn addition, Principle 38 (2) of the Declaration imposes a positive obligation on Member States not to \"condone any disruption\" of Internet access or other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population. Thus, in fulfilling the above positive obligation a Member State is not only required to refrain from conducting cyber operations that will result in disruption of Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, but the obligation further requires a Member State to condemn and refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors that conduct cyber operations to disrupt Internet access or access to critical information infrastructure, including critical computers used in strategic national sectors such as transportation, health, commerce and education.\n\n## 3.5 The ECOWAS\n\nThe founding Treaty of the ECOWAS establishes its objectives, which include: promoting regional cooperation and integration and maintaining peace, stability and security within the region.97 In pursuance of the objectives to maintain peace, stability and security within the region, the ECOWAS adopted a Protocol on Non-Aggression in 1978, which imposes obligations on Member States to refrain from using \"force or aggression\" and \"any other means inconsistent with\" the Charter of the United Nations or Constitutive Act of the AU against the territorial integrity and political independence of\n\n97 See Art. 58 ECOWAS Treaty.",

However, its provisions can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 2 of the Protocol requires every Member State to “refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the territorial integrity or political independence of other Member States”.⁹⁹ The Protocol does not define the meaning of terms such as ‘subversion’, ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’, hence resort shall be had to other definitions of those terms. ‘Subversion’ simply refers to undermining the power and authority of an established system or institution or State.¹⁰⁰ ‘Hostility’ refers to hostile or unfriendly behaviour such as acts of warfare.¹⁰¹ Similarly, ‘aggression’ refers to hostile behaviour such as the act of attacking a State.¹⁰² Thus, a broad interpretation of acts of ‘subversion’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will include State sponsored cyber operations that seek to undermine the power and authority of a Member State. This, for example, will include State sponsored online disinformation campaigns that are targeted to cause disruption and chaos within another Member State. A broad interpretation of acts of ‘hostility’ and ‘aggression’ within the context of Article 2 of the Protocol will also include State sponsored cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure located within the territory of a Member State. In addition, fulfilment of the obligation under Article 2 of the Protocol will require Member States to condemn cyber operations that disrupt or harm national critical infrastructure in another Member State and also to refrain from providing support to State or non-State actors in the conduct of such operations.\n\nArticle 3 of the Protocol further imposes obligations on Member States to prevent foreigners resident within their territories from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other Member States.¹⁰³ A broad interpretation of this obligation in the context of cyber operations implies, for example, that Member States are required to hold foreigners resident within their territories accountable where they engage in or encourage cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State. In addition, the Protocol requires every Member State to prevent “non-resident foreigners”\n\n98 See Art. 1 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol (1978).\n99 See Art. 2 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol.\n100 See The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (8th Edition, 2015), p. 1491.\n101 Ibid, p. 727.\n102 Ibid, p. 28.\n103 See Art. 3 ECOWAS Non–Aggression Protocol.",

Application of this obligation in the context of cyber operations would require a Member State to refrain from providing its territory as a base to “non-resident foreigners” for the purpose of conducting cyber operations that cause disruption or harm within another Member State.\n\n## 3.6 The SADC\n\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the SADC is to safeguard peace, stability and security within the SADC region. In pursuance of this objective, the SADC adopted a Mutual Defence Protocol in August, 2003. The Protocol does not mention State sponsored cyber operations; however, Article 8 of the Protocol can be broadly interpreted as applying to State sponsored cyber operations. In this regard, Article 8 of the Protocol provides that: “State parties undertake not to nurture, harbour or support any person, group of persons or institutions whose aim is to destabilize the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party”. Article 2 of the Protocol defines the term destabilize as:\n\nto instigate, plan, execute or assist in any of the following:\n\n(a) an armed attack against a State party;\n(b) sabotage aimed at the people of a State Party or an asset of a State party, whether inside or outside the territory of the State party; or,\n(c) any act or activity aimed at changing the constitutional order of a State Party through unconstitutional mean.¹⁰⁴\n\nIn light of the above definition of destabilization, a broad interpretation of Article 8 of the Protocol would require, for example, that a State Party is to refrain from nurturing, harbouring, instigating or supporting any person, group of persons or institutions that seek to carry out cyber operations with the aim of disrupting or sabotaging national critical information infrastructure with a view to destabilizing the political, military, territorial and economic or social security of a State party. The SADC has also recognized a connection between cybersecurity and regional instability. For example, in 2004, the SADC Strategic Plan on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation recognized the need to build capacity to combat cybercrime and terrorism in\n\n¹⁰⁴ See Art. 2 SADC Mutual Defense Protocol (2003).",

In most cases, such issues have been highlighted briefly in laws and policy instruments without providing clear definitions or national doctrines. For example, in Ghana, the Cybersecurity Act provides for the establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority which will be responsible “for taking measures in response to cybersecurity incidents that occur within and outside the country which may threaten national security; the defence of the country; the economy of the country; [and] international relations between the State and other countries”. However, aside from this provision, Ghana has not established a clear national doctrine that addresses cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n\nIn Malawi, the National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes the development of a cybersecurity contingency plan that will include the role of the military during cyberattacks and emergencies.¹⁰⁶ The Strategy also proposes the development of a Cyber Defence Strategy that establishes approaches to addressing national security threats in cyberspace.¹⁰⁷ The Strategy further grants the military a prominent role in the management of cybersecurity incidents. In this regard, the Strategy provides that the Malawi Defence Force in collaboration with the Malawi Computer Emergency Response Team “will continuously monitor the cyberspace sphere to identify and address cyber threats and risks to the National Security of Malawi”.¹⁰⁸ However, aside from the above declarations in Malawi’s National Cybersecurity Strategy, the country is yet to develop a clear national doctrine that addresses State sponsored cyber operations or acts of aggression in cyberspace. Similarly, in Kenya, the government prescribes a broad role for the Ministry of Defence in cybersecurity governance.\n\n¹⁰⁵ See SADC Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (2004), p. 38.\n\n¹⁰⁶ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy (2019–2024), p. 16, <https: 160=\"\" api.pppc.mw=\"\" national-cybers-col.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">, visited on 15 February 2022.\n\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n\n¹⁰⁸ See Malawi National Cybersecurity Strategy, p. 29.</https:>",
    "AFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nIn this regard, the Kenyan Ministry of Defence White Paper declares that \"cyber-attacks can undermine State security. [The] Ministry of Defence in collaboration with other stakeholders must develop appropriate capacity and institute measures to safeguard information systems\".[109] However, beyond this declaration, Kenya is yet to develop the role of the military in the management of cybersecurity threats, and the country is yet to develop a policy on cyber defence or State sponsored cyber operations.\n\nIn Morocco, the military plays a prominent role in cybersecurity governance. In this regard, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has the responsibility of overseeing the development of cybersecurity and cyber defence capabilities and for ensuring the resilience and availability of the country's military operational networks.[110] Morocco has also developed several cyber-related capabilities; however, despite the military's role in the management of cybersecurity threats, the country is yet to develop a formalized military policy or electronic on cybersecurity.[111]\n\nSouth Africa appears to be the only African country that has recognized cyber warfare concerns in its national defence policy. In this regard, South Africa's Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 recognizes that \"information warfare\" including the targeting of political institutions and processes, is a national concern.[112] In a military context, the policy classifies South African cyberspace as a \"domain\" under \"the physical control and political authority of the South African State\".[113] The policy also classifies cybersecurity as \"a central national priority\" and further requires the Department of Defence to develop a cyber defence capability that will enhance national cyber resilience.[114] The policy further mandates the Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to focus on cyber defence by establishing a cyber defence capability within the SANDF. However, beyond this brief recognition of information warfare in the Department of Defence Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, South Africa is yet to develop clear doctrines on cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations.\n\n109 See Kenya Ministry of Defense, Defense White Paper (2017), p. 14.\n110 See M.

    "UCHENNA ORJI\n\nIn Nigeria, the National Security Strategy recognizes that “cyber threats are inherently asymmetrical with an increasing range of actors engaged in espionage and warfare”.¹¹⁵ The Strategy also classifies four major cyber threats with significant capability to damage Nigeria’s national security and economy to include: cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and “cyber conflict”.¹¹⁶ The Strategy further proposes development of a national strategic framework dedicated to cyber defence including capacity building programmes for the military. In addition, the Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy (2014) recognizes the country’s emerging opportunities in cyberspace to include exploitation of cyberspace to advance military capability in engaging external threats and conflicts. The Policy also classifies cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage and cyber conflict as major threats to Nigeria’s national security and stability.¹¹⁷\n\nUnder Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014), cyberspace is recognized as the fifth domain for driving critical national functions including national security and defence operations.¹¹⁸ The Strategy classifies sources of cyber threats to include foreign States and State sponsored actors and proposes to articulate an integrated containment of cyber threats including cyber conflict, violence and terror threats against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Strategy’s principle of integrated containment seeks to articulate containment measures which focus on shared responsibilities and cooperation among all State actors at the national, regional and global levels. However, the Strategy does not develop elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber aggression or State sponsored cyber operations, nor does it consider application of international law to cyber operations.\n\nRecently, the Office of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser reviewed its National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy to reflect emerging concerns on cyber threats and national security. Following the review, both the Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy are now contained in one document known as the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021).

In this regard, the Policy recognizes that State and non-State actors have the potential to exert leverage on cyberspace to interfere with the electoral process including interference with elections' critical infrastructure and the conduct of cyber operations to disrupt or influence the electorate.^[119]^ Another relevant element of the Policy is that it seeks to mainstream voluntary non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace through international awareness and engagement.^[120]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to adopt voluntary non-binding norms that promote responsible State behaviour and also participate in ongoing international dialogue on cyber norms. The Policy also seeks to enhance Nigeria's cyber defence capability by investing in the military to identify, prevent and repel any cyber threats to Nigeria's sovereignty and national security.^[121]^\n\nThe Policy further proposes establishment of a Defence Space Administration that will coordinate the cyber activities of armed forces in defending Nigeria against cyberattacks.^[122]^ The Defence Space Administration is meant to work with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre to develop a national cyber defence plan for Nigeria. More importantly, the proposed National Cyber Defence Plan is meant to address cross-border cyberattacks while also \"embracing requisite restraints obligated under international law\".^[123]^ This appears to indicate Nigeria's willingness to comply with existing international law when conducting cyber operations. Thus, given that Nigeria has not earlier stated the need for an international regime to regulate States in the conduct of cyber operations, it can therefore be argued to a large extent that the Policy's recognition of \"requisite restraints obligated under international law\" appears to indicate Nigeria's position on the applicability of existing international law to cyber operations conducted by States. Therefore, it can be argued that Nigeria supports the view of the United States and Western countries that existing international law applies to cyber operations.\n\nHowever, pending establishment of the National Cyber Defence Plan proposed in the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), the Policy in its present form does not establish elaborate doctrines that apply to cyber\n\n^[119]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (Office of the National Security Adviser: Abuja, 2021), pp. 5–6.\n^[120]^ See Nigeria National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (2021), p. 14.\n^[121]^ Ibid., p. 14.\n^[122]^ Ibid., pp. 41–42.\n^[123]^ Ibid., p. 42.",

    "AFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nyears.¹²⁹ The absence of many African States and regional organizations in the UNGGE process apparently has an effect on their levels of awareness of State sponsored cyber operations and the application of international law in that context. Thus, currently, many African States lack awareness about State sponsored cyber operations and the applicability of international law and this appears to reflect in their lack of policy and legal responses to issues in that regard. For example, no African State or regional organization has developed a robust regime on State sponsored cyber operations. Also no African State has clearly stated its position on the applicability of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations. This creates challenges in clearly identifying the position of African States on State sponsored cyber operations and therefore creates a situation where a broad interpretation of existing regimes has to be undertaken in order to attempt an identification of African positions. Also, to some extent, it may be argued that the mere participation of many African States in UNGGE processes may not really result in the easy identification of their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations if those States still lack robust cyber capabilities and basic capacities on cybersecurity governance. As such, in the absence of robust national cyber capabilities and basic cybersecurity governance capacities, the awareness that will be derived by African States following their participation in international cyber norms processes may produce little or no effect in terms of identifying their national positions on State sponsored cyber operations.\n\nAnother challenge is that many African countries are still in the primary stages of tackling cybercrime and are in the process of establishing cybercrime laws, policies, and institutional frameworks. For example, as of 2021, many African countries did not have cybercrime laws, cybersecurity strategies or national Computer Emergency Response Teams.¹³⁰ There is also a lack of awareness amongst policy makers on issues relating to State sponsored cyber operations. For example, lack of awareness amongst policy makers in some countries has resulted in poor interest in funding training for cybersecurity skills due to fears over the dual use of such skills.

Lack of awareness and funding is also caused by the fact that cybersecurity issues including the threat of State sponsored cyber operations is not really considered as a national security priority in many African States.¹³² This is also not unconnected with the fact that many African States face physical national security challenges such as terrorism which policy makers usually consider more pervasive than cybersecurity challenges.¹³³\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nWhile African regional organizations and States have established regional and national legal and policy measures to promote norms for cybersecurity governance, those measures largely focus on cybercrime control and cybersecurity governance.

    "AFRICA AND STATE SPONSORED CYBER OPERATIONS\n267\n\nsponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, as discussed in this chapter, there exist some African regional and national legal and policy instruments that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. A broad interpretation of these legal and policy instruments in the light of the challenges of the information society, such as State sponsored cyber operations, can be used as a guide in locating probable African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. In particular, the AU Non-Aggression Pact can be broadly interpreted as constituting the common position of African countries towards State sponsored cyber operations. However, the AU Peace and Security Council in the exercise of its mandate should consider making updates to the Pact so as to clearly reflect cyber operations. In the present state of affairs in Africa, and the challenges of identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations, the question will remain largely unanswered for some time as to whether the positions of African States on the application of existing international law to State sponsored cyber operations largely aligns with either the United States and Europe or with Russia and China. Thus, in the circumstances, it appears safer to conclude that most African States are still developing basic capabilities and are not yet aligned with either the views of the United States and Europe or with Russia and China towards State sponsored cyber operations."

    "abstract": "There is potential that cyber capabilities can be deployed by States to achieve objectives that endanger international and regional peace and security. As such, there are growing concerns that State sponsored cyber operations can harm the critical infrastructure and information systems of other States. In Africa, regional organizations and States have established legal measures with a view to promoting norms for cybersecurity governance. However, to a large extent the focus on cybersecurity governance in Africa appears to be mainly directed towards curbing cybercrimes. While there is no doubt that existing African cybersecurity governance measures will help to promote cyber stability, it does not appear that such measures explicitly address State sponsored operations in cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are African regional and national legal instruments and declarations that appear to indicate the emergence of African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. However, an inquiry has not been undertaken to identify emerging African positions on international law and State sponsored cyber operations. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to inquire into emerging African positions on State sponsored cyber operations with a view to providing a picture as to how African States consider such operations within the context of international law. In so doing, the chapter will attempt to consider whether the positions of African States are in harmony with States in Northern America and Europe or Russia and China, or whether the positions of African States are not aligned with global cyber powers. The chapter will further consider challenges in identifying African positions on State sponsored cyber operations. Asst.
