Introduction\nThe nature of cyberspace, which is constantly changing and provides good cover and anonymity, makes the origin of cyber-attacks very difficult to pinpoint. Critical assets and information structures must be better understood, protected and maintained against cyber threats. Technical skills to counter the growing risk of cyber threats are limited. Often the weaknesses found in organizations in post-event analysis include porous controls around intrusion detection, monitoring and incident response. To counter this, organizations must subject their code and their systems to both internal and external examination to ensure robust cyber security configurations able to withstand attack. Critical capabilities include not just prevention and protection strategies but those enabling them to recover quickly following attacks or absorb and frustrate such attacks (Masys, 2015).\nCyber resilience helps rebalance the cost-benefit calculation in favour of defenders. All nations, particularly those at most risk, should reorient their policies based on this principle. Due to rapid technological advances, it is critical for nations to develop, implement and adhere to recovery plans that enable them to re-establish operational capacity after cyber-attacks. (Peter, 2017). Cyber capability is considered an integral part of the strategic diplomacy of all countries. However, evidence shows that states also have an interest in employing the cyber capabilities of non-state actors, and that they use either espionage or sabotage to execute attacks that are below the threshold of armed attack to in order to protect themselves from potential punishment (Robinson, 2016).\nStatistical estimates imply that significant cyber vulnerabilities and hazards may leave the critical infrastructure of countries open to attack and even incapacitation. That is, cyber criminals now have the ability to 'crash' critical systems by exploiting cyber weaknesses due to the increasing penetration of the Internet. It is because of this that despite the existence of a broad legal regime to combat cybercrime, it is problematic to legally classify a cyber-attack against infrastructure as a use of force or an armed attack. There are many reasons why it is difficult to apply the rules of international humanitarian law to cyber-attacks. Chief among these is the difficulty of estimating the impact of a given cyber-attack in a proper manner and determining the identity and political motivation of the perpetrator/s. International groups of experts have attempted to address these issues by the creation of the Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the so-called \"Tallinn Manual\") which is the most comprehensive existing guide to the applicability of international law rules to cyber conflict, cyber warfare and cyber-attacks (Pipyros, Mitrou, Gritzalis, &amp; Apostolopoulos, 2016).\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nDespite such progress, there is still confusion regarding the applicability of international law to cyber warfare. State and non-state actors may use cyber-attacks in the context of military operations. In recent events, cyber-attacks have been used as part of hybrid warfare. Cyber hacking by states is not expressly regulated or controlled in the current international regime. There is no specific principle of international law applicable, and specific treaties that expressly regulate the use of cyber-attacks have not yet been developed. While scholars point to the potential application of the law of armed conflict, this law has not been invoked thus far to respond to cyber-attacks (Hathaway et al., 2012).\nThis article explores the term ‘national critical infrastructure’ and considers ways in which such infrastructure can be targeted in cyber-attacks. It then discusses the notion of cyber resilience as an alternative to deterring cyber-attacks. The discussion of cyber resilience is followed by a discussion of the issue of attribution as an element of a resilience strategy, since a possible response to cyber-attack requires identifying the offender and responding accordingly. Finally, the article demonstrates how existing international law can be applied to cyber warfare, how it is deficient and what may be done to improve it.\n## 2. National critical infrastructure\nCritical infrastructure refers to assets which are fundamental to the functioning of a society, that is, infrastructure which provides essential services which underpin the functioning of a society. It constitutes the ‘backbone’ of a nation’s economy, security, and health (\"What Is Critical Infrastructure?\" 2017). Critical infrastructure also includes certain functions, sites and organizations which although not critical to the maintenance of essential services need protection due to the potential danger to the public their malfunction may cause, such as nuclear and chemical sites (\"Critical National Infrastructure,\" 2018). A good example of disruption of critical infrastructure, and possibly the most instructive example to date, is the Stuxnet attack of 2010 which caused substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program. Critical infrastructure is defined and viewed differently in different countries due to divergent perspectives on issues such as national interest, security policy and defence development. It is commonly analysed by sectors; the United States has 16 sectors, while the UK has 13. (Lopez, Setola, &amp; Wolthusen, 2012).\nThe term ‘critical national infrastructure’ is defined by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) in the UK as: “those facilities, systems and sites necessary for the delivery of the essential services upon which daily life ... depends and which ensure the country continues to function socially and economically” (Current and emerging trends in cyber operations: Policy, strategy and practice, 2015). Following an attempted spear-phishing attack, the CPNI released new guidance to educate the public which explained spear-phishing as “a targeted form of email deception that results in exploitation or compromise of individual devices and organizational networks”. It also explained more complex issues such as geo-spatial and multidimensional boundaries and hierarchical control systems such as SCADA systems across the UK. The potential threats posed to national interests have motivated all stakeholders to ensure cyber initiatives are coordinated in line with national risk assessments which were previously established (Lemieux, 2015).\nThe situation in the United States is somewhat different from that in the UK. Attempts to protect critical infrastructure commenced under President George W. Bush following the 2007 distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Estonia. His government established the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 which was declassified in March 2010 when President Barak Obama released public information on the CNCI and its main recommendations. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which evolved from concepts introduced in 2008, outlines how government and private sector participants in the critical infrastructure community can work together to manage risks and achieve security and resilience outcomes by 2013. It is updated regularly based on risk, policy, and strategic environments. It attempts to provide a foundation for an integrated approach to achieve \"[a] nation in which physical and cyber critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced, consequences minimized, threats identified and disrupted, and response and recovery hastened.\"\nThe existence of national critical infrastructure enables perpetrators to attack strategic targets without physical intervention for the first time in history. It is widely perceived that the target of cyber-terrorists is critical infrastructure. The recent examples of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure indicate the ongoing vulnerabilities and illustrate the urgent need to replace protection with resilience. A proper level of cyber security cannot be achieved without the necessary effort to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure.\n502\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\n## 3. Cyber resilience strategy\nResilience in terms of cyber infrastructure is commonly understood as the capability of the critical infrastructure or service to either rapidly “bounce back” following an attack or absorb and frustrate the potential of attacks. Such strategies are complementary to existing prevention and protection policies which are the pillars of current critical infrastructure protection programs. Heath-Kelly defines resilience as “attempts to avoid security failure through retrospective, anticipatory and “decapitalized” operations, rather than actually addressing disaster recovery” (Heath-Kelly, 2015).\nThere was no definition before the 1990s for the term ‘critical infrastructure’. (Lewis, 2014). The term appears to have been introduced in recognition of a world which deals with imminent threats which lead to the development in advance of resilience strategies able to confront emergent disasters which must be thought of, prepared for, and dealt with continuously. Scholars have divided resilience into different categories with various typologies. Theoretical resilience scholarship focuses on how resilience is suited to liberal notions of security, while empirical resilience scholarship attempts to put the policy-driven incorporation of resilience into a growing number of social domains. Governmental resilience philosophy depicts resilience as an optimal recovery from an adverse event through security processes (Dunn Cavelty et al., 2015). Technologies also need to be prepared for the actual process of ‘coping’ which makes the resilience discourse “a discourse of futurity” (Schott, 2013). This discussion has brought scholars to the point that, although there are some contradictions in the existing literature on what resilience is and how different types of resilience work, resilience needs to be studied in many different forms and contexts. It is no longer the only paradigm with security relevance.\n## 4. Deterrent strategy and attribution\nThe structure and the anonymity of the internet and the difficulty in identifying the person behind the attack rather than the source machine of an attack and are highly salient to the issue of attribution to individuals or states (“The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,” 2017). This concern implies the need to create a legal solution to the problems posed by attribution. The combination of all these pieces of the puzzle makes it difficult to create actual legal or political frameworks for attribution (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Making a successful attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process requiring careful management, training, and leadership. Attribution is a political stakes game and governments must invest in identifying the perpetrators based on the damage level and importance of the target. Individual governments must decide how to approach attribution and when attribution has been established well enough for action. Attribution is important for governments since any response to a specific offence requires first identifying the offender. In many cases, the challenges of establishing attribution allow offenders to stay online and hide their identity behind the attribution problem.\nThe difficulty in detecting malicious threats that affect networks causes many intrusions to go unpunished. Policy makers attempt to utilize deterrence, which has been used throughout history as a useful tool to discourage unwanted behaviour. States use this policy as rational actors who try to make decisions via cost-benefit analyses. Such deterrence can be done by changing the decision-making calculus, punishment and denial (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Deterrence by punishment features prominently in the national security strategy of various countries. During the Cold War it was widely used and played a fundamental role. The most industrialised and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage in this respect. States need to identify the ‘red line’ to distinguish between accepted and unaccepted behaviour for punishment. Threats must also be supported by the ability, resources and intent to follow through by inflicting punishment, and punishment needs to be appropriate and informed by contemporary norms and international law. The deterrent by punishment approach is the most popular defensive approach, partly due to its high profile during the Cold War; other approaches are not as popular due to the difficult nature of their application. The US, the UK and Australia have attempted to achieve deterrence through a combination of punishment and denial in order to pursue their cyber stability by covering all bases and establishing a level of complexity in applying deterrence concepts to cyberspace. It must be borne in mind that deterring cyber actions through threat is not as easy as deterring physical attacks. Establishing a deterrent framework requires a variety of steps which are quite difficult and complicated to carry out in cyber space. Obstacles to effective deterrence include establishing a threshold, communicating threats, detecting intrusions and attributing responsibility.\n503\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nAs mentioned above, distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is significant since it draws the ‘red line’. It is necessary for the deterrence policy to define clearly the punishable behaviour. According to current definitions, a cyber-attack must cause physical destruction or loss of life. Therefore, other malicious acts such as cybercrime and cyber espionage do not attain the threshold. It is important that this grey zone be defined since it needs to be addressed in national security policy. Appropriate punishments for malicious behaviour must be defined not only to comply with international law but also to draw a direct connection between the behaviour and the punishment to reinforce the deterrence policy (Jensen, 2012). According to the principle of proportionality, the retaliation must reflect the scale and scope of the original act. It is necessary to agree on what constitutes an appropriate response to cyber acts and how to distinguish between them to establish international cyber norms. A framework has been proposed by Tobias Feakin, Australia's inaugural Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to identify proportionate real-world responses to different types of cyber incidents; however, it the framework has not been officially adopted and integrated into international normative behaviour at this time. (Feakin, 2015)\nAnother issue regarding deterrence strategies is that in most cases malicious activities remain unpunished as the threats do not cross the chosen threshold. The difficulty in detecting all malicious incidents also affects deterrence strategy and many intrusions go unpunished. Basically, all threats that are lower than the threshold remain unpunished, which undermines deterrent threats. The approach of online actors is to launch numerous low-intensity attacks to remain unnoticed; in case any single act is detected, that act is likely to fall below an adversary’s threshold for retaliation. The assumption is that these actions will probably either not be noticed or will not trigger a response. The ability to avoid retaliation by use of the strategy outlined above causes the credibility of retaliation threats to be undermined.\nThe immediacy of a punishment is also very important as it correlates with its effectiveness in establishing a deterrent. The time lapse between the crossing of a red line and the associated retribution make it difficult to identify the connection between the two. Thus, the challenges of detecting the offender affect a defender’s ability to establish deterrence by punishment in cyber space. Such inconsistency confuses public perception of thresholds and reduces the credibility of the deterrence posture. This disparity between the broad range of potential actions in cyber space, weak detection and unclear response frameworks is yet to be effectively addressed (Goodman, 2010). Notwithstanding the fact that effective attribution offers multiple benefits such as strengthening the existing deterrence framework and improving collective security, the difficulty of accurately attributing responsibility makes it hard to establish a credible deterrent threat (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). The attribution process in cyberspace is challenging, and even if the perpetrator has been identified by the cyber forensic specialist, the process of imposing punishment is often slow, unreliable or impossible. The source of an attack may be masked by a variety of techniques including botnet, proxy servers and onion routing. Identifying an IP address as the source of an attack does not offer conclusive evidence about the identity and intention of the perpetrator (Council, 2010). The inherent difficulty of attribution was demonstrated by the hacking of French television channel, TV5 Monde, in April 2015. The sophisticated incident was initially identified as an act of the Islamic State, but was later found more likely to be the handiwork of Russian-based hackers (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Several types of sanctions are available that might be justified by a legal chain of attribution. Available sanctions include economic punishment, denial of participation in future international treaties and agreements, hack-back countermeasures, unilateral and multilateral action and military responses.\n## 5. International rules relating to the responsibilities of states and non-state actors\nThe importance of attribution becomes clear in the discussion of state responsibility since it is essential for states to sanction responsible malicious actors. In addition, attribution assists a state in claiming legitimacy for sanctions or countermeasures. The purpose of the law is to determine the outcome of a conflict while legitimizing that outcome determination to others. Such sanctions are applied in the context of international law and international relations, since in this context states lack an overarching authority to compel compliance via force. Therefore, they need to operate under norms established and legitimized by customary international law (Goldsmith &amp; Posner, 1999).\nCyber capabilities can be used in a range of ways. There are two main types of cyber-attack which are most often applied by non-state actors employed by states. The first is cyber-enabled espionage – at the strategic or operational level – which compromises the confidentiality of information and information systems and has the potential to distribute secrets and sensitive information to adversaries. The second type is cyber-enabled\n504\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nsabotage, which can cause severe physical ramifications, especially when targeting infrastructure such as energy or transportation networks or when used to confuse the target and undermine command and control decision-making by manipulation (Robinson, 2016).\nAs mentioned previously, attribution is necessary to validate subsequent legal action. In order to do this, states need to identify the source of an attack as well as legitimize its attribution to the satisfaction of other state actors in order to justify whatever recourse or countermeasure follows (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017). In the context of attribution, the same adjustment of law can account for differences in punishment after the attribution of an attack to a state. Different states may interpret mens rea in different ways since states are composed of a multitude of individuals with a variety of mindsets. However, it is possible for states to adjust their standards of scrutiny of the law of attribution based on the burden of proof it requires. The standard of proof as a core element of procedure can be notched higher or lower based on the severity of the chosen remedy. The mens rea requirement is only one means of fine tuning the burden of proof, while the evidentiary standard of proof presents another holistic way to incorporate the seriousness of a penalty into the generalized requirements of a procedural framework.\nA recent Cyber Conflict Project carried out by Yale University's Centre for Global Legal Challenges contributes significantly to the discussion of this matter by proposing the application of an adversarial legal framework, i.e. one primarily characterized by impartial decision makers issuing judgments on disputes based on evidence and arguments presented by parties and legal representatives (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017). The adversarial model is well suited to the context of attribution since attribution frequently relies on technical evidence and concerned parties are in the best position to acquire and present such evidence. The adversarial system for an attribution framework points the way towards a general rule of what a widely accepted law of attribution in respect of cyber infringements might look like. A significant advantage of the adversarial system is that it has an impartial adjudicator and will be driven by the concerned parties in terms of both legal argumentation and the production of facts and evidence. The Centre for Global Legal Challenges argued that the current consensus on a preponderance of the evidence standard fits the goals of attribution as it provides the optimal balance of deterrence and information production since it lowers the barriers to the establishment of attribution (and hence, increases the potential for countermeasures) while still requiring a requisite level of persuasion that would incentivize the production of relevant intelligence and information regarding the cyber-attack. When it is ruled that a state is responsible for launching a cyber-attack as a result of the above-mentioned steps being carried out, the accused state might attempt to defend itself from attribution by placing the blame on a non-state actor. Therefore, the law of attribution comes into play by following the trail to an individual hacker and then attempting to connect that person to a state in terms of legal responsibility. The doctrine of state responsibility has long existed beyond the realm of cyber-attacks and has been addressed frequently in other contexts. International law already possesses a state responsibility doctrine for attributing the malicious behaviour of non-state actors to states.\nInternational Law Commission Draft Articles (2001) sets out ways for international states to be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors. Articles 4 and 8 of the Draft have been recognized as customary international law by the ICJ and are held to set the standard interpretation of the state responsibility doctrine. Both the first and second edition of the Tallinn Manual draw on the ILC's Draft Articles to formulate their conception of the state responsibility doctrine in the context of cyber-attacks. According to the Draft, if a non-state actor is acting as an organ of the state or is acting under the instructions, directions, or control of the state, the wrongful behaviour of the non-state actor is attributable to that state. It also holds actions attributable to a state in cases where the action has been conducted by individuals who may be recognized as organs of the state. It also extends to individuals who may be considered de facto organs of the state (Scharf &amp; Day, 2012). It has been understood that the conditions described in Article 4 and 8 set tests for the notion of control. Such control tests have been employed in rulings by courts such as the ICJ.\nThere is currently a significant debate about the limitations of the existing international law as regards state responsibility. The current framework was criticized by Oona Hathaway, who argued that states can still escape responsibility by handing illegal tasks to non-state actors. She also believes that the control test may actually disincentivize state efforts to control rogue or malicious behaviour, since that test might make it impossible to hold the state responsible for wrongdoing. The control doctrine is also criticized by Peter Margulies, who notes that it requires specific, comprehensive control to be established, and claims that such a standard would exclude very significant examples of states directing non-state actors to conduct cyber-attacks. These comments led to\n505\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nthe proposition of a solution, the \"virtual test\". This test, suggested by Margulies, shifts the burden to states to demonstrate non-responsibility in cases where states funds and equip private entities or parties who engage in cyber-attacks. According to Hathaway, this approach carries risks as the potential attachment of liability to any existing relationship between the government and a non-state actor who has carried out wrongful acts might incentivize governments to relinquish control over non-state actors within its reach. The argument might be made that the \"funding and equipping\" requirement is an indicator of state contribution and must be followed by the control test, will be applied only in cases that states materially supports such entities. Further, the concept of funding and/or equipping a non-state entity is not clearly defined by Margulies. Hathaway further notes that states should have access to an affirmative defence if they can prove that they took reasonable steps to prevent violations of international law.\nThe combined weight of the above arguments could support the proposition that the law of attribution, properly re-interpreted and applied to cyber situations, may potentially be useful in addressing the novel challenges of cyber-attack attribution. The virtual control test along with an affirmative defence of \"reasonable care\" would allow the doctrine of attribution to attribute individuals' cyber-attacks to states, while allowing states sufficient means of protecting themselves from liability by taking good faith measures to prevent wrongdoing (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017).\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe Stuxnet cyber-attack revealed how vulnerable states are to cyber-attack and how important it is for states to protect their national critical infrastructure. The attack indicated that while the threat of cyber-attacks has grown rapidly, response capabilities have not kept pace. The difficulty and uncertainty in tracing cyber-attack and attributing them correctly must lead states to prioritize cyber resilience. Cyber resilience interweaves different temporal strands which reinforce long-term security for protection of critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience abilities can affect opponents' decision-making and deter the deployment of attacks. As such, cyber resilience constitutes a form of cyber defence and enables states to protect national infrastructure which may otherwise be targeted by terrorist organizations. Damage to critical infrastructure can bring states to their knees. Having a comprehensive cyber resilience policy implies the ability to verify where cyber-attacks originate, to establish advance cyber policy and to having the ability to deploy traceback and related forensic tools which can go some way towards establishing attribution. Establishing an attribution policy is the first step in developing an advanced cyber resilience policy.\nThis discussion has shown how important it is for states to establish effective cyber resilience policies to face new and growing threats. This is particularly important for highly developed and connected countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and others, and such states are already taking steps towards such policies. The discussion has also shown how the concept of attribution and its applicability to state actors behind non-state wrongdoers may be used by states to justify counter measures. The doctrine of state responsibility serves as a means to establish responsibility of states for the acts of non-state actors in specific conditions. Although concerns have been raised by scholars such as Hathaway and Margulies, the law of attribution is currently poised to develop in new and fruitful ways in order to address novel challenges. The doctrine of attribution may be used to protect states from liability in appropriate cases which also allowing for the attribution of individuals' cyber-attacks to states.",

National critical infrastructure Critical infrastructure refers to assets which are fundamental to the functioning of a society, that is, infrastructure which provides essential services which underpin the functioning of a society. It constitutes the ‘backbone’ of a nation’s economy, security, and health (\"What Is Critical Infrastructure?\"2017). Critical infrastructure also includes certain functions, sites and organizations which although not critical to the maintenance of essential services need protection due to the potential danger to the public their malfunction may cause, such as nuclear and chemical sites (\"Critical National Infrastructure,\"2018).

Deterrent strategy and attribution\nThe structure and the anonymity of the internet and the difficulty in identifying the person behind the attack rather than the source machine of an attack and are highly salient to the issue of attribution to individuals or states (“The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,” 2017). This concern implies the need to create a legal solution to the problems posed by attribution. The combination of all these pieces of the puzzle makes it difficult to create actual legal or political frameworks for attribution (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Making a successful attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process requiring careful management, training, and leadership. Attribution is a political stakes game and governments must invest in identifying the perpetrators based on the damage level and importance of the target. Individual governments must decide how to approach attribution and when attribution has been established well enough for action. Attribution is important for governments since any response to a specific offence requires first identifying the offender. In many cases, the challenges of establishing attribution allow offenders to stay online and hide their identity behind the attribution problem.\nThe difficulty in detecting malicious threats that affect networks causes many intrusions to go unpunished. Policy makers attempt to utilize deterrence, which has been used throughout history as a useful tool to discourage unwanted behaviour. States use this policy as rational actors who try to make decisions via cost-benefit analyses. Such deterrence can be done by changing the decision-making calculus, punishment and denial (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Deterrence by punishment features prominently in the national security strategy of various countries. During the Cold War it was widely used and played a fundamental role. The most industrialised and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage in this respect. States need to identify the ‘red line’ to distinguish between accepted and unaccepted behaviour for punishment. Threats must also be supported by the ability, resources and intent to follow through by inflicting punishment, and punishment needs to be appropriate and informed by contemporary norms and international law. The deterrent by punishment approach is the most popular defensive approach, partly due to its high profile during the Cold War; other approaches are not as popular due to the difficult nature of their application. The US, the UK and Australia have attempted to achieve deterrence through a combination of punishment and denial in order to pursue their cyber stability by covering all bases and establishing a level of complexity in applying deterrence concepts to cyberspace. It must be borne in mind that deterring cyber actions through threat is not as easy as deterring physical attacks. Establishing a deterrent framework requires a variety of steps which are quite difficult and complicated to carry out in cyber space. Obstacles to effective deterrence include establishing a threshold, communicating threats, detecting intrusions and attributing responsibility.\n\nAs mentioned above, distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is significant since it draws the ‘red line’. It is necessary for the deterrence policy to define clearly the punishable behaviour. According to current definitions, a cyber-attack must cause physical destruction or loss of life. Therefore, other malicious acts such as cybercrime and cyber espionage do not attain the threshold. It is important that this grey zone be defined since it needs to be addressed in national security policy. Appropriate punishments for malicious behaviour must be defined not only to comply with international law but also to draw a direct connection between the behaviour and the punishment to reinforce the deterrence policy. According to the principle of proportionality, the retaliation must reflect the scale and scope of the original act. It is necessary to agree on what constitutes an appropriate response to cyber acts and how to distinguish between them to establish international cyber norms. A framework has been proposed by Tobias Feakin, Australia's inaugural Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to identify proportionate real-world responses to different types of cyber incidents; however, it the framework has not been officially adopted and integrated into international normative behaviour at this time. Another issue regarding deterrence strategies is that in most cases malicious activities remain unpunished as the threats do not cross the chosen threshold. The difficulty in detecting all malicious incidents also affects deterrence strategy and many intrusions go unpunished. Basically, all threats that are lower than the threshold remain unpunished, which undermines deterrent threats. The approach of online actors is to launch numerous low-intensity attacks to remain unnoticed; in case any single act is detected, that act is likely to fall below an adversary’s threshold for retaliation. The assumption is that these actions will probably either not be noticed or will not trigger a response. The ability to avoid retaliation by use of the strategy outlined above causes the credibility of retaliation threats to be undermined.\nThe immediacy of a punishment is also very important as it correlates with its effectiveness in establishing a deterrent. The time lapse between the crossing of a red line and the associated retribution make it difficult to identify the connection between the two. Thus, the challenges of detecting the offender affect a defender’s ability to establish deterrence by punishment in cyber space. Such inconsistency confuses public perception of thresholds and reduces the credibility of the deterrence posture. This disparity between the broad range of potential actions in cyber space, weak detection and unclear response frameworks is yet to be effectively addressed. Notwithstanding the fact that effective attribution offers multiple benefits such as strengthening the existing deterrence framework and improving collective security, the difficulty of accurately attributing responsibility makes it hard to establish a credible deterrent threat (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). The attribution process in cyberspace is challenging, and even if the perpetrator has been identified by the cyber forensic specialist, the process of imposing punishment is often slow, unreliable or impossible. The source of an attack may be masked by a variety of techniques including botnet, proxy servers and onion routing. Identifying an IP address as the source of an attack does not offer conclusive evidence about the identity and intention of the perpetrator. The inherent difficulty of attribution was demonstrated by the hacking of French television channel, TV5 Monde, in April 2015. The sophisticated incident was initially identified as an act of the Islamic State, but was later found more likely to be the handiwork of Russian-based hackers (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Several types of sanctions are available that might be justified by a legal chain of attribution. Available sanctions include economic punishment, denial of participation in future international treaties and agreements, hack-back countermeasures, unilateral and multilateral action and military responses.\n## 5. International rules relating to the responsibilities of states and non-state actors The importance of attribution becomes clear in the discussion of state responsibility since it is essential for states to sanction responsible malicious actors. In addition, attribution assists a state in claiming legitimacy for sanctions or countermeasures. The purpose of the law is to determine the outcome of a conflict while legitimizing that outcome determination to others. Such sanctions are applied in the context of international law and international relations, since in this context states lack an overarching authority to compel compliance via force. Therefore, they need to operate under norms established and legitimized by customary international law (Goldsmith &amp; Posner, 1999).\nCyber capabilities can be used in a range of ways. There are two main types of cyber-attack which are most often applied by non-state actors employed by states. The first is cyber-enabled espionage – at the strategic or operational level – which compromises the confidentiality of information and information systems and has the potential to distribute secrets and sensitive information to adversaries. The second type is cyber-enabled sabotage, which can cause severe physical ramifications, especially when targeting infrastructure such as energy or transportation networks or when used to confuse the target and undermine command and control decision-making by manipulation.\nAs mentioned previously, attribution is necessary to validate subsequent legal action. In order to do this, states need to identify the source of an attack as well as legitimize its attribution to the satisfaction of other state actors in order to justify whatever recourse or countermeasure follows (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017). In the context of attribution, the same adjustment of law can account for differences in punishment after the attribution of an attack to a state. Different states may interpret mens rea in different ways since states are composed of a multitude of individuals with a variety of mindsets. However, it is possible for states to adjust their standards of scrutiny of the law of attribution based on the burden of proof it requires. The standard of proof as a core element of procedure can be notched higher or lower based on the severity of the chosen remedy. The mens rea requirement is only one means of fine tuning the burden of proof, while the evidentiary standard of proof presents another holistic way to incorporate the seriousness of a penalty into the generalized requirements of a procedural framework.\nA recent Cyber Conflict Project carried out by Yale University's Centre for Global Legal Challenges contributes significantly to the discussion of this matter by proposing the application of an adversarial legal framework, i.e. one primarily characterized by impartial decision makers issuing judgments on disputes based on evidence and arguments presented by parties and legal representatives (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017). The adversarial model is well suited to the context of attribution since attribution frequently relies on technical evidence and concerned parties are in the best position to acquire and present such evidence. The adversarial system for an attribution framework points the way towards a general rule of what a widely accepted law of attribution in respect of cyber infringements might look like. A significant advantage of the adversarial system is that it has an impartial adjudicator and will be driven by the concerned parties in terms of both legal argumentation and the production of facts and evidence. The Centre for Global Legal Challenges argued that the current consensus on a preponderance of the evidence standard fits the goals of attribution as it provides the optimal balance of deterrence and information production since it lowers the barriers to the establishment of attribution (and hence, increases the potential for countermeasures) while still requiring a requisite level of persuasion that would incentivize the production of relevant intelligence and information regarding the cyber-attack. When it is ruled that a state is responsible for launching a cyber-attack as a result of the above-mentioned steps being carried out, the accused state might attempt to defend itself from attribution by placing the blame on a non-state actor. Therefore, the law of attribution comes into play by following the trail to an individual hacker and then attempting to connect that person to a state in terms of legal responsibility. The doctrine of state responsibility has long existed beyond the realm of cyber-attacks and has been addressed frequently in other contexts. International law already possesses a state responsibility doctrine for attributing the malicious behaviour of non-state actors to states.\nInternational Law Commission Draft Articles (2001) sets out ways for international states to be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors. Articles 4 and 8 of the Draft have been recognized as customary international law by the ICJ and are held to set the standard interpretation of the state responsibility doctrine. Both the first and second edition of the Tallinn Manual draw on the ILC's Draft Articles to formulate their conception of the state responsibility doctrine in the context of cyber-attacks. According to the Draft, if a non-state actor is acting as an organ of the state or is acting under the instructions, directions, or control of the state, the wrongful behaviour of the non-state actor is attributable to that state. It also holds actions attributable to a state in cases where the action has been conducted by individuals who may be recognized as organs of the state. It also extends to individuals who may be considered de facto organs of the state (Scharf &amp; Day, 2012). It has been understood that the conditions described in Article 4 and 8 set tests for the notion of control. Such control tests have been employed in rulings by courts such as the ICJ.\nThere is currently a significant debate about the limitations of the existing international law as regards state responsibility. The current framework was criticized by Oona Hathaway, who argued that states can still escape responsibility by handing illegal tasks to non-state actors. She also believes that the control test may actually disincentivize state efforts to control rogue or malicious behaviour, since that test might make it impossible to hold the state responsible for wrongdoing. The control doctrine is also criticized by Peter Margulies, who notes that it requires specific, comprehensive control to be established, and claims that such a standard would exclude very significant examples of states directing non-state actors to conduct cyber-attacks. These comments led to the proposition of a solution, the\"virtual test\". This test, suggested by Margulies, shifts the burden to states to demonstrate non-responsibility in cases where states funds and equip private entities or parties who engage in cyber-attacks. According to Hathaway, this approach carries risks as the potential attachment of liability to any existing relationship between the government and a non-state actor who has carried out wrongful acts might incentivize governments to relinquish control over non-state actors within its reach. The argument might be made that the\"funding and equipping\"requirement is an indicator of state contribution and must be followed by the control test, will be applied only in cases that states materially supports such entities. Further, the concept of funding and/or equipping a non-state entity is not clearly defined by Margulies. Hathaway further notes that states should have access to an affirmative defence if they can prove that they took reasonable steps to prevent violations of international law.\nThe combined weight of the above arguments could support the proposition that the law of attribution, properly re-interpreted and applied to cyber situations, may potentially be useful in addressing the novel challenges of cyber-attack attribution. The virtual control test along with an affirmative defence of\"reasonable care\"would allow the doctrine of attribution to attribute individuals' cyber-attacks to states, while allowing states sufficient means of protecting themselves from liability by taking good faith measures to prevent wrongdoing (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017).\n## 6. Conclusion The Stuxnet cyber-attack revealed how vulnerable states are to cyber-attack and how important it is for states to protect their national critical infrastructure. The attack indicated that while the threat of cyber-attacks has grown rapidly, response capabilities have not kept pace. The difficulty and uncertainty in tracing cyber-attack and attributing them correctly must lead states to prioritize cyber resilience. Cyber resilience interweaves different temporal strands which reinforce long-term security for protection of critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience abilities can affect opponents' decision-making and deter the deployment of attacks. As such, cyber resilience constitutes a form of cyber defence and enables states to protect national infrastructure which may otherwise be targeted by terrorist organizations. Damage to critical infrastructure can bring states to their knees. Having a comprehensive cyber resilience policy implies the ability to verify where cyber-attacks originate, to establish advance cyber policy and to having the ability to deploy traceback and related forensic tools which can go some way towards establishing attribution. Establishing an attribution policy is the first step in developing an advanced cyber resilience policy.\nThis discussion has shown how important it is for states to establish effective cyber resilience policies to face new and growing threats. This is particularly important for highly developed and connected countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and others, and such states are already taking steps towards such policies. The discussion has also shown how the concept of attribution and its applicability to state actors behind non-state wrongdoers may be used by states to justify counter measures. The doctrine of state responsibility serves as a means to establish responsibility of states for the acts of non-state actors in specific conditions. Although concerns have been raised by scholars such as Hathaway and Margulies, the law of attribution is currently poised to develop in new and fruitful ways in order to address novel challenges. The doctrine of attribution may be used to protect states from liability in appropriate cases which also allowing for the attribution of individuals' cyber-attacks to states.",

    "## 2. National critical infrastructure Critical infrastructure refers to assets which are fundamental to the functioning of a society, that is, infrastructure which provides essential services which underpin the functioning of a society. It constitutes the ‘backbone’ of a nation’s economy, security, and health (\"What Is Critical Infrastructure?\"2017). Critical infrastructure also includes certain functions, sites and organizations which although not critical to the maintenance of essential services need protection due to the potential danger to the public their malfunction may cause, such as nuclear and chemical sites (\"Critical National Infrastructure,\"2018). A good example of disruption of critical infrastructure, and possibly the most instructive example to date, is the Stuxnet attack of 2010 which caused substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program. Critical infrastructure is defined and viewed differently in different countries due to divergent perspectives on issues such as national interest, security policy and defence development. It is commonly analysed by sectors; the United States has 16 sectors, while the UK has 13. (Lopez, Setola, &amp; Wolthusen, 2012).": "The term ‘critical national infrastructure’ is defined by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) in the UK as: “those facilities, systems and sites necessary for the delivery of the essential services upon which daily life... depends and which ensure the country continues to function socially and economically” (Current and emerging trends in cyber operations: Policy, strategy and practice, 2015). Following an attempted spear-phishing attack, the CPNI released new guidance to educate the public which explained spear-phishing as “a targeted form of email deception that results in exploitation or compromise of individual devices and organizational networks”. It also explained more complex issues such as geo-spatial and multidimensional boundaries and hierarchical control systems such as SCADA systems across the UK. The potential threats posed to national interests have motivated all stakeholders to ensure cyber initiatives are coordinated in line with national risk assessments which were previously established.\nThe situation in the United States is somewhat different from that in the UK. Attempts to protect critical infrastructure commenced under President George W. Bush following the 2007 distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Estonia. His government established the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 which was declassified in March 2010 when President Barak Obama released public information on the CNCI and its main recommendations. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which evolved from concepts introduced in 2008, outlines how government and private sector participants in the critical infrastructure community can work together to manage risks and achieve security and resilience outcomes by 2013. It is updated regularly based on risk, policy, and strategic environments. It attempts to provide a foundation for an integrated approach to achieve\"[a] nation in which physical and cyber critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced, consequences minimized, threats identified and disrupted, and response and recovery hastened.\"\nThe existence of national critical infrastructure enables perpetrators to attack strategic targets without physical intervention for the first time in history. It is widely perceived that the target of cyber-terrorists is critical infrastructure. The recent examples of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure indicate the ongoing vulnerabilities and illustrate the urgent need to replace protection with resilience. A proper level of cyber security cannot be achieved without the necessary effort to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure.",
    "## 3. Cyber resilience strategy": "Resilience in terms of cyber infrastructure is commonly understood as the capability of the critical infrastructure or service to either rapidly “bounce back” following an attack or absorb and frustrate the potential of attacks. Such strategies are complementary to existing prevention and protection policies which are the pillars of current critical infrastructure protection programs. Heath-Kelly defines resilience as “attempts to avoid security failure through retrospective, anticipatory and “decapitalized” operations, rather than actually addressing disaster recovery” .\nThere was no definition before the 1990s for the term ‘critical infrastructure’. . The term appears to have been introduced in recognition of a world which deals with imminent threats which lead to the development in advance of resilience strategies able to confront emergent disasters which must be thought of, prepared for, and dealt with continuously. Scholars have divided resilience into different categories with various typologies. Theoretical resilience scholarship focuses on how resilience is suited to liberal notions of security, while empirical resilience scholarship attempts to put the policy-driven incorporation of resilience into a growing number of social domains. Governmental resilience philosophy depicts resilience as an optimal recovery from an adverse event through security processes (Dunn Cavelty et al., 2015). Technologies also need to be prepared for the actual process of ‘coping’ which makes the resilience discourse “a discourse of futurity” . This discussion has brought scholars to the point that, although there are some contradictions in the existing literature on what resilience is and how different types of resilience work, resilience needs to be studied in many different forms and contexts. It is no longer the only paradigm with security relevance.",

These comments led to the proposition of a solution, the\"virtual test\". This test, suggested by Margulies, shifts the burden to states to demonstrate non-responsibility in cases where states funds and equip private entities or parties who engage in cyber-attacks. According to Hathaway, this approach carries risks as the potential attachment of liability to any existing relationship between the government and a non-state actor who has carried out wrongful acts might incentivize governments to relinquish control over non-state actors within its reach. The argument might be made that the\"funding and equipping\"requirement is an indicator of state contribution and must be followed by the control test, will be applied only in cases that states materially supports such entities. Further, the concept of funding and/or equipping a non-state entity is not clearly defined by Margulies. Hathaway further notes that states should have access to an affirmative defence if they can prove that they took reasonable steps to prevent violations of international law.\nThe combined weight of the above arguments could support the proposition that the law of attribution, properly re-interpreted and applied to cyber situations, may potentially be useful in addressing the novel challenges of cyber-attack attribution. The virtual control test along with an affirmative defence of\"reasonable care\"would allow the doctrine of attribution to attribute individuals' cyber-attacks to states, while allowing states sufficient means of protecting themselves from liability by taking good faith measures to prevent wrongdoing (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017).",
    "## 6. Conclusion The Stuxnet cyber-attack revealed how vulnerable states are to cyber-attack and how important it is for states to protect their national critical infrastructure. The attack indicated that while the threat of cyber-attacks has grown rapidly, response capabilities have not kept pace. The difficulty and uncertainty in tracing cyber-attack and attributing them correctly must lead states to prioritize cyber resilience. Cyber resilience interweaves different temporal strands which reinforce long-term security for protection of critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience abilities can affect opponents' decision-making and deter the deployment of attacks. As such, cyber resilience constitutes a form of cyber defence and enables states to protect national infrastructure which may otherwise be targeted by terrorist organizations. Damage to critical infrastructure can bring states to their knees. Having a comprehensive cyber resilience policy implies the ability to verify where cyber-attacks originate, to establish advance cyber policy and to having the ability to deploy traceback and related forensic tools which can go some way towards establishing attribution. Establishing an attribution policy is the first step in developing an advanced cyber resilience policy.": "This discussion has shown how important it is for states to establish effective cyber resilience policies to face new and growing threats. This is particularly important for highly developed and connected countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and others, and such states are already taking steps towards such policies. The discussion has also shown how the concept of attribution and its applicability to state actors behind non-state wrongdoers may be used by states to justify counter measures. The doctrine of state responsibility serves as a means to establish responsibility of states for the acts of non-state actors in specific conditions. Although concerns have been raised by scholars such as Hathaway and Margulies, the law of attribution is currently poised to develop in new and fruitful ways in order to address novel challenges. The doctrine of attribution may be used to protect states from liability in appropriate cases which also allowing for the attribution of individuals' cyber-attacks to states."

The 'fifth dimension war' portrays 'cyber warfare' as a new battlefield which impels states to protect their critical infrastructure against attacks. Large-scale disruption of critical infrastructure caused by cyber-attacks undermines confidence in the state, emphasizing outdated security policies. It is difficult to accurately attribute the source, purpose or motives of cyber-attacks. The anonymity conferred by encrypting and hiding the sources of attack facilitates the implementation of cyber-attacks by terrorist organizations. It is impossible to prevent all attacks on critical infrastructure, even if protection measures are implemented appropriately. This implies that technology and updated infrastructure alone are not sufficient as a response. Additional measures along with specific procedures to facilitate faster recovery of assets that have suffered cyber-attacks are essential in responding to damage to critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience's key concepts such as prevention, preparedness and response are the new policies of developed regions. This article aims to further illuminate the underlying principles of national critical infrastructure defence in cyber warfare with the objective of providing a cyber resilience strategy. It also attempts to examine the issue of attribution and the applicability of international rules to state and non-state actors for malicious cyber activities in the context of attribution. The examination is conducted via a multilevel legal analysis.\nKeywords: cyber resilience, attribution, cyber terrorism, critical infrastructure, international law # 1. Introduction The nature of cyberspace, which is constantly changing and provides good cover and anonymity, makes the origin of cyber-attacks very difficult to pinpoint. Critical assets and information structures must be better understood, protected and maintained against cyber threats. Technical skills to counter the growing risk of cyber threats are limited. Often the weaknesses found in organizations in post-event analysis include porous controls around intrusion detection, monitoring and incident response. To counter this, organizations must subject their code and their systems to both internal and external examination to ensure robust cyber security configurations able to withstand attack. Critical capabilities include not just prevention and protection strategies but those enabling them to recover quickly following attacks or absorb and frustrate such attacks.\nCyber resilience helps rebalance the cost-benefit calculation in favour of defenders. All nations, particularly those at most risk, should reorient their policies based on this principle. Due to rapid technological advances, it is critical for nations to develop, implement and adhere to recovery plans that enable them to re-establish operational capacity after cyber-attacks.. Cyber capability is considered an integral part of the strategic diplomacy of all countries. However, evidence shows that states also have an interest in employing the cyber capabilities of non-state actors, and that they use either espionage or sabotage to execute attacks that are below the threshold of armed attack to in order to protect themselves from potential punishment.\nStatistical estimates imply that significant cyber vulnerabilities and hazards may leave the critical infrastructure of countries open to attack and even incapacitation. That is, cyber criminals now have the ability to 'crash' critical systems by exploiting cyber weaknesses due to the increasing penetration of the Internet. It is because of this that despite the existence of a broad legal regime to combat cybercrime, it is problematic to legally classify a cyber-attack against infrastructure as a use of force or an armed attack. There are many reasons why it is difficult to apply the rules of international humanitarian law to cyber-attacks. Chief among these is the difficulty of estimating the impact of a given cyber-attack in a proper manner and determining the identity and political motivation of the perpetrator/s. International groups of experts have attempted to address these issues by the creation of the Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the so-called\"Tallinn Manual\") which is the most comprehensive existing guide to the applicability of international law rules to cyber conflict, cyber warfare and cyber-attacks (Pipyros, Mitrou, Gritzalis, &amp; Apostolopoulos, 2016).\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani Despite such progress, there is still confusion regarding the applicability of international law to cyber warfare. State and non-state actors may use cyber-attacks in the context of military operations. In recent events, cyber-attacks have been used as part of hybrid warfare. Cyber hacking by states is not expressly regulated or controlled in the current international regime. There is no specific principle of international law applicable, and specific treaties that expressly regulate the use of cyber-attacks have not yet been developed. While scholars point to the potential application of the law of armed conflict, this law has not been invoked thus far to respond to cyber-attacks.\nThis article explores the term ‘national critical infrastructure’ and considers ways in which such infrastructure can be targeted in cyber-attacks. It then discusses the notion of cyber resilience as an alternative to deterring cyber-attacks. The discussion of cyber resilience is followed by a discussion of the issue of attribution as an element of a resilience strategy, since a possible response to cyber-attack requires identifying the offender and responding accordingly. Finally, the article demonstrates how existing international law can be applied to cyber warfare, how it is deficient and what may be done to improve it.\n## 2. National critical infrastructure Critical infrastructure refers to assets which are fundamental to the functioning of a society, that is, infrastructure which provides essential services which underpin the functioning of a society. It constitutes the ‘backbone’ of a nation’s economy, security, and health (\"What Is Critical Infrastructure?\"2017). Critical infrastructure also includes certain functions, sites and organizations which although not critical to the maintenance of essential services need protection due to the potential danger to the public their malfunction may cause, such as nuclear and chemical sites (\"Critical National Infrastructure,\"2018). A good example of disruption of critical infrastructure, and possibly the most instructive example to date, is the Stuxnet attack of 2010 which caused substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program. Critical infrastructure is defined and viewed differently in different countries due to divergent perspectives on issues such as national interest, security policy and defence development. It is commonly analysed by sectors; the United States has 16 sectors, while the UK has 13. (Lopez, Setola, &amp; Wolthusen, 2012).\nThe term ‘critical national infrastructure’ is defined by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) in the UK as: “those facilities, systems and sites necessary for the delivery of the essential services upon which daily life... depends and which ensure the country continues to function socially and economically” (Current and emerging trends in cyber operations: Policy, strategy and practice, 2015). Following an attempted spear-phishing attack, the CPNI released new guidance to educate the public which explained spear-phishing as “a targeted form of email deception that results in exploitation or compromise of individual devices and organizational networks”. It also explained more complex issues such as geo-spatial and multidimensional boundaries and hierarchical control systems such as SCADA systems across the UK. The potential threats posed to national interests have motivated all stakeholders to ensure cyber initiatives are coordinated in line with national risk assessments which were previously established.\nThe situation in the United States is somewhat different from that in the UK. Attempts to protect critical infrastructure commenced under President George W. Bush following the 2007 distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Estonia. His government established the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 which was declassified in March 2010 when President Barak Obama released public information on the CNCI and its main recommendations. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which evolved from concepts introduced in 2008, outlines how government and private sector participants in the critical infrastructure community can work together to manage risks and achieve security and resilience outcomes by 2013. It is updated regularly based on risk, policy, and strategic environments. It attempts to provide a foundation for an integrated approach to achieve\"[a] nation in which physical and cyber critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced, consequences minimized, threats identified and disrupted, and response and recovery hastened.\"\nThe existence of national critical infrastructure enables perpetrators to attack strategic targets without physical intervention for the first time in history. It is widely perceived that the target of cyber-terrorists is critical infrastructure. The recent examples of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure indicate the ongoing vulnerabilities and illustrate the urgent need to replace protection with resilience. A proper level of cyber security cannot be achieved without the necessary effort to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure.\n\n## 3. Cyber resilience strategy\nResilience in terms of cyber infrastructure is commonly understood as the capability of the critical infrastructure or service to either rapidly “bounce back” following an attack or absorb and frustrate the potential of attacks. Such strategies are complementary to existing prevention and protection policies which are the pillars of current critical infrastructure protection programs. Heath-Kelly defines resilience as “attempts to avoid security failure through retrospective, anticipatory and “decapitalized” operations, rather than actually addressing disaster recovery” .\nThere was no definition before the 1990s for the term ‘critical infrastructure’. . The term appears to have been introduced in recognition of a world which deals with imminent threats which lead to the development in advance of resilience strategies able to confront emergent disasters which must be thought of, prepared for, and dealt with continuously. Scholars have divided resilience into different categories with various typologies. Theoretical resilience scholarship focuses on how resilience is suited to liberal notions of security, while empirical resilience scholarship attempts to put the policy-driven incorporation of resilience into a growing number of social domains. Governmental resilience philosophy depicts resilience as an optimal recovery from an adverse event through security processes (Dunn Cavelty et al., 2015). Technologies also need to be prepared for the actual process of ‘coping’ which makes the resilience discourse “a discourse of futurity” . This discussion has brought scholars to the point that, although there are some contradictions in the existing literature on what resilience is and how different types of resilience work, resilience needs to be studied in many different forms and contexts. It is no longer the only paradigm with security relevance.\n## 4. Deterrent strategy and attribution\nThe structure and the anonymity of the internet and the difficulty in identifying the person behind the attack rather than the source machine of an attack and are highly salient to the issue of attribution to individuals or states (“The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,” 2017). This concern implies the need to create a legal solution to the problems posed by attribution. The combination of all these pieces of the puzzle makes it difficult to create actual legal or political frameworks for attribution (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Making a successful attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process requiring careful management, training, and leadership. Attribution is a political stakes game and governments must invest in identifying the perpetrators based on the damage level and importance of the target. Individual governments must decide how to approach attribution and when attribution has been established well enough for action. Attribution is important for governments since any response to a specific offence requires first identifying the offender. In many cases, the challenges of establishing attribution allow offenders to stay online and hide their identity behind the attribution problem.\nThe difficulty in detecting malicious threats that affect networks causes many intrusions to go unpunished. Policy makers attempt to utilize deterrence, which has been used throughout history as a useful tool to discourage unwanted behaviour. States use this policy as rational actors who try to make decisions via cost-benefit analyses. Such deterrence can be done by changing the decision-making calculus, punishment and denial (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Deterrence by punishment features prominently in the national security strategy of various countries. During the Cold War it was widely used and played a fundamental role. The most industrialised and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage in this respect. States need to identify the ‘red line’ to distinguish between accepted and unaccepted behaviour for punishment. Threats must also be supported by the ability, resources and intent to follow through by inflicting punishment, and punishment needs to be appropriate and informed by contemporary norms and international law. The deterrent by punishment approach is the most popular defensive approach, partly due to its high profile during the Cold War; other approaches are not as popular due to the difficult nature of their application. The US, the UK and Australia have attempted to achieve deterrence through a combination of punishment and denial in order to pursue their cyber stability by covering all bases and establishing a level of complexity in applying deterrence concepts to cyberspace. It must be borne in mind that deterring cyber actions through threat is not as easy as deterring physical attacks. Establishing a deterrent framework requires a variety of steps which are quite difficult and complicated to carry out in cyber space. Obstacles to effective deterrence include establishing a threshold, communicating threats, detecting intrusions and attributing responsibility.\n\nAs mentioned above, distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is significant since it draws the ‘red line’. It is necessary for the deterrence policy to define clearly the punishable behaviour. According to current definitions, a cyber-attack must cause physical destruction or loss of life. Therefore, other malicious acts such as cybercrime and cyber espionage do not attain the threshold. It is important that this grey zone be defined since it needs to be addressed in national security policy. Appropriate punishments for malicious behaviour must be defined not only to comply with international law but also to draw a direct connection between the behaviour and the punishment to reinforce the deterrence policy. According to the principle of proportionality, the retaliation must reflect the scale and scope of the original act. It is necessary to agree on what constitutes an appropriate response to cyber acts and how to distinguish between them to establish international cyber norms. A framework has been proposed by Tobias Feakin, Australia's inaugural Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to identify proportionate real-world responses to different types of cyber incidents; however, it the framework has not been officially adopted and integrated into international normative behaviour at this time. Another issue regarding deterrence strategies is that in most cases malicious activities remain unpunished as the threats do not cross the chosen threshold. The difficulty in detecting all malicious incidents also affects deterrence strategy and many intrusions go unpunished. Basically, all threats that are lower than the threshold remain unpunished, which undermines deterrent threats. The approach of online actors is to launch numerous low-intensity attacks to remain unnoticed; in case any single act is detected, that act is likely to fall below an adversary’s threshold for retaliation. The assumption is that these actions will probably either not be noticed or will not trigger a response. The ability to avoid retaliation by use of the strategy outlined above causes the credibility of retaliation threats to be undermined.\nThe immediacy of a punishment is also very important as it correlates with its effectiveness in establishing a deterrent. The time lapse between the crossing of a red line and the associated retribution make it difficult to identify the connection between the two. Thus, the challenges of detecting the offender affect a defender’s ability to establish deterrence by punishment in cyber space. Such inconsistency confuses public perception of thresholds and reduces the credibility of the deterrence posture. This disparity between the broad range of potential actions in cyber space, weak detection and unclear response frameworks is yet to be effectively addressed. Notwithstanding the fact that effective attribution offers multiple benefits such as strengthening the existing deterrence framework and improving collective security, the difficulty of accurately attributing responsibility makes it hard to establish a credible deterrent threat (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). The attribution process in cyberspace is challenging, and even if the perpetrator has been identified by the cyber forensic specialist, the process of imposing punishment is often slow, unreliable or impossible. The source of an attack may be masked by a variety of techniques including botnet, proxy servers and onion routing. Identifying an IP address as the source of an attack does not offer conclusive evidence about the identity and intention of the perpetrator. The inherent difficulty of attribution was demonstrated by the hacking of French television channel, TV5 Monde, in April 2015. The sophisticated incident was initially identified as an act of the Islamic State, but was later found more likely to be the handiwork of Russian-based hackers (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Several types of sanctions are available that might be justified by a legal chain of attribution. Available sanctions include economic punishment, denial of participation in future international treaties and agreements, hack-back countermeasures, unilateral and multilateral action and military responses.\n## 5. International rules relating to the responsibilities of states and non-state actors The importance of attribution becomes clear in the discussion of state responsibility since it is essential for states to sanction responsible malicious actors. In addition, attribution assists a state in claiming legitimacy for sanctions or countermeasures. The purpose of the law is to determine the outcome of a conflict while legitimizing that outcome determination to others. Such sanctions are applied in the context of international law and international relations, since in this context states lack an overarching authority to compel compliance via force. Therefore, they need to operate under norms established and legitimized by customary international law (Goldsmith &amp; Posner, 1999).\nCyber capabilities can be used in a range of ways. There are two main types of cyber-attack which are most often applied by non-state actors employed by states. The first is cyber-enabled espionage – at the strategic or operational level – which compromises the confidentiality of information and information systems and has the potential to distribute secrets and sensitive information to adversaries. The second type is cyber-enabled sabotage, which can cause severe physical ramifications, especially when targeting infrastructure such as energy or transportation networks or when used to confuse the target and undermine command and control decision-making by manipulation.\nAs mentioned previously, attribution is necessary to validate subsequent legal action. In order to do this, states need to identify the source of an attack as well as legitimize its attribution to the satisfaction of other state actors in order to justify whatever recourse or countermeasure follows (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017). In the context of attribution, the same adjustment of law can account for differences in punishment after the attribution of an attack to a state. Different states may interpret mens rea in different ways since states are composed of a multitude of individuals with a variety of mindsets. However, it is possible for states to adjust their standards of scrutiny of the law of attribution based on the burden of proof it requires. The standard of proof as a core element of procedure can be notched higher or lower based on the severity of the chosen remedy. The mens rea requirement is only one means of fine tuning the burden of proof, while the evidentiary standard of proof presents another holistic way to incorporate the seriousness of a penalty into the generalized requirements of a procedural framework.\nA recent Cyber Conflict Project carried out by Yale University's Centre for Global Legal Challenges contributes significantly to the discussion of this matter by proposing the application of an adversarial legal framework, i.e. one primarily characterized by impartial decision makers issuing judgments on disputes based on evidence and arguments presented by parties and legal representatives (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017). The adversarial model is well suited to the context of attribution since attribution frequently relies on technical evidence and concerned parties are in the best position to acquire and present such evidence. The adversarial system for an attribution framework points the way towards a general rule of what a widely accepted law of attribution in respect of cyber infringements might look like. A significant advantage of the adversarial system is that it has an impartial adjudicator and will be driven by the concerned parties in terms of both legal argumentation and the production of facts and evidence. The Centre for Global Legal Challenges argued that the current consensus on a preponderance of the evidence standard fits the goals of attribution as it provides the optimal balance of deterrence and information production since it lowers the barriers to the establishment of attribution (and hence, increases the potential for countermeasures) while still requiring a requisite level of persuasion that would incentivize the production of relevant intelligence and information regarding the cyber-attack. When it is ruled that a state is responsible for launching a cyber-attack as a result of the above-mentioned steps being carried out, the accused state might attempt to defend itself from attribution by placing the blame on a non-state actor. Therefore, the law of attribution comes into play by following the trail to an individual hacker and then attempting to connect that person to a state in terms of legal responsibility. The doctrine of state responsibility has long existed beyond the realm of cyber-attacks and has been addressed frequently in other contexts. International law already possesses a state responsibility doctrine for attributing the malicious behaviour of non-state actors to states.\nInternational Law Commission Draft Articles (2001) sets out ways for international states to be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors. Articles 4 and 8 of the Draft have been recognized as customary international law by the ICJ and are held to set the standard interpretation of the state responsibility doctrine. Both the first and second edition of the Tallinn Manual draw on the ILC's Draft Articles to formulate their conception of the state responsibility doctrine in the context of cyber-attacks. According to the Draft, if a non-state actor is acting as an organ of the state or is acting under the instructions, directions, or control of the state, the wrongful behaviour of the non-state actor is attributable to that state. It also holds actions attributable to a state in cases where the action has been conducted by individuals who may be recognized as organs of the state. It also extends to individuals who may be considered de facto organs of the state (Scharf &amp; Day, 2012). It has been understood that the conditions described in Article 4 and 8 set tests for the notion of control. Such control tests have been employed in rulings by courts such as the ICJ.\nThere is currently a significant debate about the limitations of the existing international law as regards state responsibility. The current framework was criticized by Oona Hathaway, who argued that states can still escape responsibility by handing illegal tasks to non-state actors. She also believes that the control test may actually disincentivize state efforts to control rogue or malicious behaviour, since that test might make it impossible to hold the state responsible for wrongdoing. The control doctrine is also criticized by Peter Margulies, who notes that it requires specific, comprehensive control to be established, and claims that such a standard would exclude very significant examples of states directing non-state actors to conduct cyber-attacks. These comments led to the proposition of a solution, the\"virtual test\". This test, suggested by Margulies, shifts the burden to states to demonstrate non-responsibility in cases where states funds and equip private entities or parties who engage in cyber-attacks. According to Hathaway, this approach carries risks as the potential attachment of liability to any existing relationship between the government and a non-state actor who has carried out wrongful acts might incentivize governments to relinquish control over non-state actors within its reach. The argument might be made that the\"funding and equipping\"requirement is an indicator of state contribution and must be followed by the control test, will be applied only in cases that states materially supports such entities. Further, the concept of funding and/or equipping a non-state entity is not clearly defined by Margulies. Hathaway further notes that states should have access to an affirmative defence if they can prove that they took reasonable steps to prevent violations of international law.\nThe combined weight of the above arguments could support the proposition that the law of attribution, properly re-interpreted and applied to cyber situations, may potentially be useful in addressing the novel challenges of cyber-attack attribution. The virtual control test along with an affirmative defence of\"reasonable care\"would allow the doctrine of attribution to attribute individuals' cyber-attacks to states, while allowing states sufficient means of protecting themselves from liability by taking good faith measures to prevent wrongdoing (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017).\n## 6. Conclusion The Stuxnet cyber-attack revealed how vulnerable states are to cyber-attack and how important it is for states to protect their national critical infrastructure. The attack indicated that while the threat of cyber-attacks has grown rapidly, response capabilities have not kept pace. The difficulty and uncertainty in tracing cyber-attack and attributing them correctly must lead states to prioritize cyber resilience. Cyber resilience interweaves different temporal strands which reinforce long-term security for protection of critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience abilities can affect opponents' decision-making and deter the deployment of attacks. As such, cyber resilience constitutes a form of cyber defence and enables states to protect national infrastructure which may otherwise be targeted by terrorist organizations. Damage to critical infrastructure can bring states to their knees. Having a comprehensive cyber resilience policy implies the ability to verify where cyber-attacks originate, to establish advance cyber policy and to having the ability to deploy traceback and related forensic tools which can go some way towards establishing attribution. Establishing an attribution policy is the first step in developing an advanced cyber resilience policy.\nThis discussion has shown how important it is for states to establish effective cyber resilience policies to face new and growing threats. This is particularly important for highly developed and connected countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and others, and such states are already taking steps towards such policies. The discussion has also shown how the concept of attribution and its applicability to state actors behind non-state wrongdoers may be used by states to justify counter measures. The doctrine of state responsibility serves as a means to establish responsibility of states for the acts of non-state actors in specific conditions. Although concerns have been raised by scholars such as Hathaway and Margulies, the law of attribution is currently poised to develop in new and fruitful ways in order to address novel challenges. The doctrine of attribution may be used to protect states from liability in appropriate cases which also allowing for the attribution of individuals' cyber-attacks to states.",

The examination is conducted via a multilevel legal analysis.\nKeywords: cyber resilience, attribution, cyber terrorism, critical infrastructure, international law\n# 1. Introduction\nThe nature of cyberspace, which is constantly changing and provides good cover and anonymity, makes the origin of cyber-attacks very difficult to pinpoint. Critical assets and information structures must be better understood, protected and maintained against cyber threats. Technical skills to counter the growing risk of cyber threats are limited. Often the weaknesses found in organizations in post-event analysis include porous controls around intrusion detection, monitoring and incident response. To counter this, organizations must subject their code and their systems to both internal and external examination to ensure robust cyber security configurations able to withstand attack. Critical capabilities include not just prevention and protection strategies but those enabling them to recover quickly following attacks or absorb and frustrate such attacks (Masys, 2015).\nCyber resilience helps rebalance the cost-benefit calculation in favour of defenders. All nations, particularly those at most risk, should reorient their policies based on this principle. Due to rapid technological advances, it is critical for nations to develop, implement and adhere to recovery plans that enable them to re-establish operational capacity after cyber-attacks. (Peter, 2017). Cyber capability is considered an integral part of the strategic diplomacy of all countries. However, evidence shows that states also have an interest in employing the cyber capabilities of non-state actors, and that they use either espionage or sabotage to execute attacks that are below the threshold of armed attack to in order to protect themselves from potential punishment (Robinson, 2016).\nStatistical estimates imply that significant cyber vulnerabilities and hazards may leave the critical infrastructure of countries open to attack and even incapacitation. That is, cyber criminals now have the ability to 'crash' critical systems by exploiting cyber weaknesses due to the increasing penetration of the Internet. It is because of this that despite the existence of a broad legal regime to combat cybercrime, it is problematic to legally classify a cyber-attack against infrastructure as a use of force or an armed attack. There are many reasons why it is difficult to apply the rules of international humanitarian law to cyber-attacks. Chief among these is the difficulty of estimating the impact of a given cyber-attack in a proper manner and determining the identity and political motivation of the perpetrator/s. International groups of experts have attempted to address these issues by the creation of the Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the so-called \"Tallinn Manual\") which is the most comprehensive existing guide to the applicability of international law rules to cyber conflict, cyber warfare and cyber-attacks (Pipyros, Mitrou, Gritzalis, &amp; Apostolopoulos, 2016).\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nDespite such progress, there is still confusion regarding the applicability of international law to cyber warfare. State and non-state actors may use cyber-attacks in the context of military operations. In recent events, cyber-attacks have been used as part of hybrid warfare. Cyber hacking by states is not expressly regulated or controlled in the current international regime. There is no specific principle of international law applicable, and specific treaties that expressly regulate the use of cyber-attacks have not yet been developed. While scholars point to the potential application of the law of armed conflict, this law has not been invoked thus far to respond to cyber-attacks (Hathaway et al., 2012).\nThis article explores the term ‘national critical infrastructure’ and considers ways in which such infrastructure can be targeted in cyber-attacks. It then discusses the notion of cyber resilience as an alternative to deterring cyber-attacks. The discussion of cyber resilience is followed by a discussion of the issue of attribution as an element of a resilience strategy, since a possible response to cyber-attack requires identifying the offender and responding accordingly. Finally, the article demonstrates how existing international law can be applied to cyber warfare, how it is deficient and what may be done to improve it.\n## 2. National critical infrastructure\nCritical infrastructure refers to assets which are fundamental to the functioning of a society, that is, infrastructure which provides essential services which underpin the functioning of a society. It constitutes the ‘backbone’ of a nation’s economy, security, and health (\"What Is Critical Infrastructure?\" 2017). Critical infrastructure also includes certain functions, sites and organizations which although not critical to the maintenance of essential services need protection due to the potential danger to the public their malfunction may cause, such as nuclear and chemical sites (\"Critical National Infrastructure,\" 2018). A good example of disruption of critical infrastructure, and possibly the most instructive example to date, is the Stuxnet attack of 2010 which caused substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program. Critical infrastructure is defined and viewed differently in different countries due to divergent perspectives on issues such as national interest, security policy and defence development. It is commonly analysed by sectors; the United States has 16 sectors, while the UK has 13. (Lopez, Setola, &amp; Wolthusen, 2012).\nThe term ‘critical national infrastructure’ is defined by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) in the UK as: “those facilities, systems and sites necessary for the delivery of the essential services upon which daily life ... depends and which ensure the country continues to function socially and economically” (Current and emerging trends in cyber operations: Policy, strategy and practice, 2015). Following an attempted spear-phishing attack, the CPNI released new guidance to educate the public which explained spear-phishing as “a targeted form of email deception that results in exploitation or compromise of individual devices and organizational networks”. It also explained more complex issues such as geo-spatial and multidimensional boundaries and hierarchical control systems such as SCADA systems across the UK. The potential threats posed to national interests have motivated all stakeholders to ensure cyber initiatives are coordinated in line with national risk assessments which were previously established (Lemieux, 2015).\nThe situation in the United States is somewhat different from that in the UK. Attempts to protect critical infrastructure commenced under President George W. Bush following the 2007 distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Estonia. His government established the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 which was declassified in March 2010 when President Barak Obama released public information on the CNCI and its main recommendations. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which evolved from concepts introduced in 2008, outlines how government and private sector participants in the critical infrastructure community can work together to manage risks and achieve security and resilience outcomes by 2013. It is updated regularly based on risk, policy, and strategic environments. It attempts to provide a foundation for an integrated approach to achieve \"[a] nation in which physical and cyber critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced, consequences minimized, threats identified and disrupted, and response and recovery hastened.\"\nThe existence of national critical infrastructure enables perpetrators to attack strategic targets without physical intervention for the first time in history. It is widely perceived that the target of cyber-terrorists is critical infrastructure. The recent examples of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure indicate the ongoing vulnerabilities and illustrate the urgent need to replace protection with resilience. A proper level of cyber security cannot be achieved without the necessary effort to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure.\n502\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\n## 3. Cyber resilience strategy\nResilience in terms of cyber infrastructure is commonly understood as the capability of the critical infrastructure or service to either rapidly “bounce back” following an attack or absorb and frustrate the potential of attacks. Such strategies are complementary to existing prevention and protection policies which are the pillars of current critical infrastructure protection programs. Heath-Kelly defines resilience as “attempts to avoid security failure through retrospective, anticipatory and “decapitalized” operations, rather than actually addressing disaster recovery” (Heath-Kelly, 2015).\nThere was no definition before the 1990s for the term ‘critical infrastructure’. (Lewis, 2014). The term appears to have been introduced in recognition of a world which deals with imminent threats which lead to the development in advance of resilience strategies able to confront emergent disasters which must be thought of, prepared for, and dealt with continuously. Scholars have divided resilience into different categories with various typologies. Theoretical resilience scholarship focuses on how resilience is suited to liberal notions of security, while empirical resilience scholarship attempts to put the policy-driven incorporation of resilience into a growing number of social domains. Governmental resilience philosophy depicts resilience as an optimal recovery from an adverse event through security processes (Dunn Cavelty et al., 2015). Technologies also need to be prepared for the actual process of ‘coping’ which makes the resilience discourse “a discourse of futurity” (Schott, 2013). This discussion has brought scholars to the point that, although there are some contradictions in the existing literature on what resilience is and how different types of resilience work, resilience needs to be studied in many different forms and contexts. It is no longer the only paradigm with security relevance.\n## 4. Deterrent strategy and attribution\nThe structure and the anonymity of the internet and the difficulty in identifying the person behind the attack rather than the source machine of an attack and are highly salient to the issue of attribution to individuals or states (“The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,” 2017). This concern implies the need to create a legal solution to the problems posed by attribution. The combination of all these pieces of the puzzle makes it difficult to create actual legal or political frameworks for attribution (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Making a successful attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process requiring careful management, training, and leadership. Attribution is a political stakes game and governments must invest in identifying the perpetrators based on the damage level and importance of the target. Individual governments must decide how to approach attribution and when attribution has been established well enough for action. Attribution is important for governments since any response to a specific offence requires first identifying the offender. In many cases, the challenges of establishing attribution allow offenders to stay online and hide their identity behind the attribution problem.\nThe difficulty in detecting malicious threats that affect networks causes many intrusions to go unpunished. Policy makers attempt to utilize deterrence, which has been used throughout history as a useful tool to discourage unwanted behaviour. States use this policy as rational actors who try to make decisions via cost-benefit analyses. Such deterrence can be done by changing the decision-making calculus, punishment and denial (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Deterrence by punishment features prominently in the national security strategy of various countries. During the Cold War it was widely used and played a fundamental role. The most industrialised and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage in this respect. States need to identify the ‘red line’ to distinguish between accepted and unaccepted behaviour for punishment. Threats must also be supported by the ability, resources and intent to follow through by inflicting punishment, and punishment needs to be appropriate and informed by contemporary norms and international law. The deterrent by punishment approach is the most popular defensive approach, partly due to its high profile during the Cold War; other approaches are not as popular due to the difficult nature of their application. The US, the UK and Australia have attempted to achieve deterrence through a combination of punishment and denial in order to pursue their cyber stability by covering all bases and establishing a level of complexity in applying deterrence concepts to cyberspace. It must be borne in mind that deterring cyber actions through threat is not as easy as deterring physical attacks. Establishing a deterrent framework requires a variety of steps which are quite difficult and complicated to carry out in cyber space. Obstacles to effective deterrence include establishing a threshold, communicating threats, detecting intrusions and attributing responsibility.\n503\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nAs mentioned above, distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is significant since it draws the ‘red line’. It is necessary for the deterrence policy to define clearly the punishable behaviour. According to current definitions, a cyber-attack must cause physical destruction or loss of life. Therefore, other malicious acts such as cybercrime and cyber espionage do not attain the threshold. It is important that this grey zone be defined since it needs to be addressed in national security policy. Appropriate punishments for malicious behaviour must be defined not only to comply with international law but also to draw a direct connection between the behaviour and the punishment to reinforce the deterrence policy (Jensen, 2012). According to the principle of proportionality, the retaliation must reflect the scale and scope of the original act. It is necessary to agree on what constitutes an appropriate response to cyber acts and how to distinguish between them to establish international cyber norms. A framework has been proposed by Tobias Feakin, Australia's inaugural Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to identify proportionate real-world responses to different types of cyber incidents; however, it the framework has not been officially adopted and integrated into international normative behaviour at this time. (Feakin, 2015)\nAnother issue regarding deterrence strategies is that in most cases malicious activities remain unpunished as the threats do not cross the chosen threshold. The difficulty in detecting all malicious incidents also affects deterrence strategy and many intrusions go unpunished. Basically, all threats that are lower than the threshold remain unpunished, which undermines deterrent threats. The approach of online actors is to launch numerous low-intensity attacks to remain unnoticed; in case any single act is detected, that act is likely to fall below an adversary’s threshold for retaliation. The assumption is that these actions will probably either not be noticed or will not trigger a response. The ability to avoid retaliation by use of the strategy outlined above causes the credibility of retaliation threats to be undermined.\nThe immediacy of a punishment is also very important as it correlates with its effectiveness in establishing a deterrent. The time lapse between the crossing of a red line and the associated retribution make it difficult to identify the connection between the two. Thus, the challenges of detecting the offender affect a defender’s ability to establish deterrence by punishment in cyber space. Such inconsistency confuses public perception of thresholds and reduces the credibility of the deterrence posture. This disparity between the broad range of potential actions in cyber space, weak detection and unclear response frameworks is yet to be effectively addressed (Goodman, 2010). Notwithstanding the fact that effective attribution offers multiple benefits such as strengthening the existing deterrence framework and improving collective security, the difficulty of accurately attributing responsibility makes it hard to establish a credible deterrent threat (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). The attribution process in cyberspace is challenging, and even if the perpetrator has been identified by the cyber forensic specialist, the process of imposing punishment is often slow, unreliable or impossible. The source of an attack may be masked by a variety of techniques including botnet, proxy servers and onion routing. Identifying an IP address as the source of an attack does not offer conclusive evidence about the identity and intention of the perpetrator (Council, 2010). The inherent difficulty of attribution was demonstrated by the hacking of French television channel, TV5 Monde, in April 2015. The sophisticated incident was initially identified as an act of the Islamic State, but was later found more likely to be the handiwork of Russian-based hackers (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Several types of sanctions are available that might be justified by a legal chain of attribution. Available sanctions include economic punishment, denial of participation in future international treaties and agreements, hack-back countermeasures, unilateral and multilateral action and military responses.\n## 5. International rules relating to the responsibilities of states and non-state actors\nThe importance of attribution becomes clear in the discussion of state responsibility since it is essential for states to sanction responsible malicious actors. In addition, attribution assists a state in claiming legitimacy for sanctions or countermeasures. The purpose of the law is to determine the outcome of a conflict while legitimizing that outcome determination to others. Such sanctions are applied in the context of international law and international relations, since in this context states lack an overarching authority to compel compliance via force. Therefore, they need to operate under norms established and legitimized by customary international law (Goldsmith &amp; Posner, 1999).\nCyber capabilities can be used in a range of ways. There are two main types of cyber-attack which are most often applied by non-state actors employed by states. The first is cyber-enabled espionage – at the strategic or operational level – which compromises the confidentiality of information and information systems and has the potential to distribute secrets and sensitive information to adversaries. The second type is cyber-enabled\n504\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nsabotage, which can cause severe physical ramifications, especially when targeting infrastructure such as energy or transportation networks or when used to confuse the target and undermine command and control decision-making by manipulation (Robinson, 2016).\nAs mentioned previously, attribution is necessary to validate subsequent legal action. In order to do this, states need to identify the source of an attack as well as legitimize its attribution to the satisfaction of other state actors in order to justify whatever recourse or countermeasure follows (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017). In the context of attribution, the same adjustment of law can account for differences in punishment after the attribution of an attack to a state. Different states may interpret mens rea in different ways since states are composed of a multitude of individuals with a variety of mindsets. However, it is possible for states to adjust their standards of scrutiny of the law of attribution based on the burden of proof it requires. The standard of proof as a core element of procedure can be notched higher or lower based on the severity of the chosen remedy. The mens rea requirement is only one means of fine tuning the burden of proof, while the evidentiary standard of proof presents another holistic way to incorporate the seriousness of a penalty into the generalized requirements of a procedural framework.\nA recent Cyber Conflict Project carried out by Yale University's Centre for Global Legal Challenges contributes significantly to the discussion of this matter by proposing the application of an adversarial legal framework, i.e. one primarily characterized by impartial decision makers issuing judgments on disputes based on evidence and arguments presented by parties and legal representatives (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017). The adversarial model is well suited to the context of attribution since attribution frequently relies on technical evidence and concerned parties are in the best position to acquire and present such evidence. The adversarial system for an attribution framework points the way towards a general rule of what a widely accepted law of attribution in respect of cyber infringements might look like. A significant advantage of the adversarial system is that it has an impartial adjudicator and will be driven by the concerned parties in terms of both legal argumentation and the production of facts and evidence. The Centre for Global Legal Challenges argued that the current consensus on a preponderance of the evidence standard fits the goals of attribution as it provides the optimal balance of deterrence and information production since it lowers the barriers to the establishment of attribution (and hence, increases the potential for countermeasures) while still requiring a requisite level of persuasion that would incentivize the production of relevant intelligence and information regarding the cyber-attack. When it is ruled that a state is responsible for launching a cyber-attack as a result of the above-mentioned steps being carried out, the accused state might attempt to defend itself from attribution by placing the blame on a non-state actor. Therefore, the law of attribution comes into play by following the trail to an individual hacker and then attempting to connect that person to a state in terms of legal responsibility. The doctrine of state responsibility has long existed beyond the realm of cyber-attacks and has been addressed frequently in other contexts. International law already possesses a state responsibility doctrine for attributing the malicious behaviour of non-state actors to states.\nInternational Law Commission Draft Articles (2001) sets out ways for international states to be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors. Articles 4 and 8 of the Draft have been recognized as customary international law by the ICJ and are held to set the standard interpretation of the state responsibility doctrine. Both the first and second edition of the Tallinn Manual draw on the ILC's Draft Articles to formulate their conception of the state responsibility doctrine in the context of cyber-attacks. According to the Draft, if a non-state actor is acting as an organ of the state or is acting under the instructions, directions, or control of the state, the wrongful behaviour of the non-state actor is attributable to that state. It also holds actions attributable to a state in cases where the action has been conducted by individuals who may be recognized as organs of the state. It also extends to individuals who may be considered de facto organs of the state (Scharf &amp; Day, 2012). It has been understood that the conditions described in Article 4 and 8 set tests for the notion of control. Such control tests have been employed in rulings by courts such as the ICJ.\nThere is currently a significant debate about the limitations of the existing international law as regards state responsibility. The current framework was criticized by Oona Hathaway, who argued that states can still escape responsibility by handing illegal tasks to non-state actors. She also believes that the control test may actually disincentivize state efforts to control rogue or malicious behaviour, since that test might make it impossible to hold the state responsible for wrongdoing.

Further, the concept of funding and/or equipping a non-state entity is not clearly defined by Margulies. Hathaway further notes that states should have access to an affirmative defence if they can prove that they took reasonable steps to prevent violations of international law.\nThe combined weight of the above arguments could support the proposition that the law of attribution, properly re-interpreted and applied to cyber situations, may potentially be useful in addressing the novel challenges of cyber-attack attribution.

Introduction\nThe nature of cyberspace, which is constantly changing and provides good cover and anonymity, makes the origin of cyber-attacks very difficult to pinpoint. Critical assets and information structures must be better understood, protected and maintained against cyber threats. Technical skills to counter the growing risk of cyber threats are limited. Often the weaknesses found in organizations in post-event analysis include porous controls around intrusion detection, monitoring and incident response. To counter this, organizations must subject their code and their systems to both internal and external examination to ensure robust cyber security configurations able to withstand attack. Critical capabilities include not just prevention and protection strategies but those enabling them to recover quickly following attacks or absorb and frustrate such attacks (Masys, 2015).\nCyber resilience helps rebalance the cost-benefit calculation in favour of defenders. All nations, particularly those at most risk, should reorient their policies based on this principle. Due to rapid technological advances, it is critical for nations to develop, implement and adhere to recovery plans that enable them to re-establish operational capacity after cyber-attacks. (Peter, 2017). Cyber capability is considered an integral part of the strategic diplomacy of all countries. However, evidence shows that states also have an interest in employing the cyber capabilities of non-state actors, and that they use either espionage or sabotage to execute attacks that are below the threshold of armed attack to in order to protect themselves from potential punishment (Robinson, 2016).\nStatistical estimates imply that significant cyber vulnerabilities and hazards may leave the critical infrastructure of countries open to attack and even incapacitation. That is, cyber criminals now have the ability to 'crash' critical systems by exploiting cyber weaknesses due to the increasing penetration of the Internet. It is because of this that despite the existence of a broad legal regime to combat cybercrime, it is problematic to legally classify a cyber-attack against infrastructure as a use of force or an armed attack. There are many reasons why it is difficult to apply the rules of international humanitarian law to cyber-attacks. Chief among these is the difficulty of estimating the impact of a given cyber-attack in a proper manner and determining the identity and political motivation of the perpetrator/s. International groups of experts have attempted to address these issues by the creation of the Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the so-called \"Tallinn Manual\") which is the most comprehensive existing guide to the applicability of international law rules to cyber conflict, cyber warfare and cyber-attacks (Pipyros, Mitrou, Gritzalis, &amp; Apostolopoulos, 2016).\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nDespite such progress, there is still confusion regarding the applicability of international law to cyber warfare. State and non-state actors may use cyber-attacks in the context of military operations. In recent events, cyber-attacks have been used as part of hybrid warfare. Cyber hacking by states is not expressly regulated or controlled in the current international regime. There is no specific principle of international law applicable, and specific treaties that expressly regulate the use of cyber-attacks have not yet been developed. While scholars point to the potential application of the law of armed conflict, this law has not been invoked thus far to respond to cyber-attacks (Hathaway et al., 2012).\nThis article explores the term ‘national critical infrastructure’ and considers ways in which such infrastructure can be targeted in cyber-attacks. It then discusses the notion of cyber resilience as an alternative to deterring cyber-attacks. The discussion of cyber resilience is followed by a discussion of the issue of attribution as an element of a resilience strategy, since a possible response to cyber-attack requires identifying the offender and responding accordingly. Finally, the article demonstrates how existing international law can be applied to cyber warfare, how it is deficient and what may be done to improve it.\n## 2. National critical infrastructure\nCritical infrastructure refers to assets which are fundamental to the functioning of a society, that is, infrastructure which provides essential services which underpin the functioning of a society. It constitutes the ‘backbone’ of a nation’s economy, security, and health (\"What Is Critical Infrastructure?\" 2017). Critical infrastructure also includes certain functions, sites and organizations which although not critical to the maintenance of essential services need protection due to the potential danger to the public their malfunction may cause, such as nuclear and chemical sites (\"Critical National Infrastructure,\" 2018). A good example of disruption of critical infrastructure, and possibly the most instructive example to date, is the Stuxnet attack of 2010 which caused substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program. Critical infrastructure is defined and viewed differently in different countries due to divergent perspectives on issues such as national interest, security policy and defence development. It is commonly analysed by sectors; the United States has 16 sectors, while the UK has 13. (Lopez, Setola, &amp; Wolthusen, 2012).\nThe term ‘critical national infrastructure’ is defined by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) in the UK as: “those facilities, systems and sites necessary for the delivery of the essential services upon which daily life ... depends and which ensure the country continues to function socially and economically” (Current and emerging trends in cyber operations: Policy, strategy and practice, 2015). Following an attempted spear-phishing attack, the CPNI released new guidance to educate the public which explained spear-phishing as “a targeted form of email deception that results in exploitation or compromise of individual devices and organizational networks”. It also explained more complex issues such as geo-spatial and multidimensional boundaries and hierarchical control systems such as SCADA systems across the UK. The potential threats posed to national interests have motivated all stakeholders to ensure cyber initiatives are coordinated in line with national risk assessments which were previously established (Lemieux, 2015).\nThe situation in the United States is somewhat different from that in the UK. Attempts to protect critical infrastructure commenced under President George W. Bush following the 2007 distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Estonia. His government established the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 which was declassified in March 2010 when President Barak Obama released public information on the CNCI and its main recommendations. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which evolved from concepts introduced in 2008, outlines how government and private sector participants in the critical infrastructure community can work together to manage risks and achieve security and resilience outcomes by 2013. It is updated regularly based on risk, policy, and strategic environments. It attempts to provide a foundation for an integrated approach to achieve \"[a] nation in which physical and cyber critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced, consequences minimized, threats identified and disrupted, and response and recovery hastened.\"\nThe existence of national critical infrastructure enables perpetrators to attack strategic targets without physical intervention for the first time in history. It is widely perceived that the target of cyber-terrorists is critical infrastructure. The recent examples of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure indicate the ongoing vulnerabilities and illustrate the urgent need to replace protection with resilience. A proper level of cyber security cannot be achieved without the necessary effort to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure.\n502\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\n## 3. Cyber resilience strategy\nResilience in terms of cyber infrastructure is commonly understood as the capability of the critical infrastructure or service to either rapidly “bounce back” following an attack or absorb and frustrate the potential of attacks. Such strategies are complementary to existing prevention and protection policies which are the pillars of current critical infrastructure protection programs. Heath-Kelly defines resilience as “attempts to avoid security failure through retrospective, anticipatory and “decapitalized” operations, rather than actually addressing disaster recovery” (Heath-Kelly, 2015).\nThere was no definition before the 1990s for the term ‘critical infrastructure’. (Lewis, 2014). The term appears to have been introduced in recognition of a world which deals with imminent threats which lead to the development in advance of resilience strategies able to confront emergent disasters which must be thought of, prepared for, and dealt with continuously. Scholars have divided resilience into different categories with various typologies. Theoretical resilience scholarship focuses on how resilience is suited to liberal notions of security, while empirical resilience scholarship attempts to put the policy-driven incorporation of resilience into a growing number of social domains. Governmental resilience philosophy depicts resilience as an optimal recovery from an adverse event through security processes (Dunn Cavelty et al., 2015). Technologies also need to be prepared for the actual process of ‘coping’ which makes the resilience discourse “a discourse of futurity” (Schott, 2013). This discussion has brought scholars to the point that, although there are some contradictions in the existing literature on what resilience is and how different types of resilience work, resilience needs to be studied in many different forms and contexts. It is no longer the only paradigm with security relevance.\n## 4. Deterrent strategy and attribution\nThe structure and the anonymity of the internet and the difficulty in identifying the person behind the attack rather than the source machine of an attack and are highly salient to the issue of attribution to individuals or states (“The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,” 2017). This concern implies the need to create a legal solution to the problems posed by attribution. The combination of all these pieces of the puzzle makes it difficult to create actual legal or political frameworks for attribution (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Making a successful attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process requiring careful management, training, and leadership. Attribution is a political stakes game and governments must invest in identifying the perpetrators based on the damage level and importance of the target. Individual governments must decide how to approach attribution and when attribution has been established well enough for action. Attribution is important for governments since any response to a specific offence requires first identifying the offender. In many cases, the challenges of establishing attribution allow offenders to stay online and hide their identity behind the attribution problem.\nThe difficulty in detecting malicious threats that affect networks causes many intrusions to go unpunished. Policy makers attempt to utilize deterrence, which has been used throughout history as a useful tool to discourage unwanted behaviour. States use this policy as rational actors who try to make decisions via cost-benefit analyses. Such deterrence can be done by changing the decision-making calculus, punishment and denial (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Deterrence by punishment features prominently in the national security strategy of various countries. During the Cold War it was widely used and played a fundamental role. The most industrialised and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage in this respect. States need to identify the ‘red line’ to distinguish between accepted and unaccepted behaviour for punishment. Threats must also be supported by the ability, resources and intent to follow through by inflicting punishment, and punishment needs to be appropriate and informed by contemporary norms and international law. The deterrent by punishment approach is the most popular defensive approach, partly due to its high profile during the Cold War; other approaches are not as popular due to the difficult nature of their application. The US, the UK and Australia have attempted to achieve deterrence through a combination of punishment and denial in order to pursue their cyber stability by covering all bases and establishing a level of complexity in applying deterrence concepts to cyberspace. It must be borne in mind that deterring cyber actions through threat is not as easy as deterring physical attacks. Establishing a deterrent framework requires a variety of steps which are quite difficult and complicated to carry out in cyber space. Obstacles to effective deterrence include establishing a threshold, communicating threats, detecting intrusions and attributing responsibility.\n503\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nAs mentioned above, distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is significant since it draws the ‘red line’. It is necessary for the deterrence policy to define clearly the punishable behaviour. According to current definitions, a cyber-attack must cause physical destruction or loss of life. Therefore, other malicious acts such as cybercrime and cyber espionage do not attain the threshold. It is important that this grey zone be defined since it needs to be addressed in national security policy. Appropriate punishments for malicious behaviour must be defined not only to comply with international law but also to draw a direct connection between the behaviour and the punishment to reinforce the deterrence policy (Jensen, 2012). According to the principle of proportionality, the retaliation must reflect the scale and scope of the original act. It is necessary to agree on what constitutes an appropriate response to cyber acts and how to distinguish between them to establish international cyber norms. A framework has been proposed by Tobias Feakin, Australia's inaugural Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to identify proportionate real-world responses to different types of cyber incidents; however, it the framework has not been officially adopted and integrated into international normative behaviour at this time. (Feakin, 2015)\nAnother issue regarding deterrence strategies is that in most cases malicious activities remain unpunished as the threats do not cross the chosen threshold. The difficulty in detecting all malicious incidents also affects deterrence strategy and many intrusions go unpunished. Basically, all threats that are lower than the threshold remain unpunished, which undermines deterrent threats. The approach of online actors is to launch numerous low-intensity attacks to remain unnoticed; in case any single act is detected, that act is likely to fall below an adversary’s threshold for retaliation. The assumption is that these actions will probably either not be noticed or will not trigger a response. The ability to avoid retaliation by use of the strategy outlined above causes the credibility of retaliation threats to be undermined.\nThe immediacy of a punishment is also very important as it correlates with its effectiveness in establishing a deterrent. The time lapse between the crossing of a red line and the associated retribution make it difficult to identify the connection between the two. Thus, the challenges of detecting the offender affect a defender’s ability to establish deterrence by punishment in cyber space. Such inconsistency confuses public perception of thresholds and reduces the credibility of the deterrence posture. This disparity between the broad range of potential actions in cyber space, weak detection and unclear response frameworks is yet to be effectively addressed (Goodman, 2010). Notwithstanding the fact that effective attribution offers multiple benefits such as strengthening the existing deterrence framework and improving collective security, the difficulty of accurately attributing responsibility makes it hard to establish a credible deterrent threat (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). The attribution process in cyberspace is challenging, and even if the perpetrator has been identified by the cyber forensic specialist, the process of imposing punishment is often slow, unreliable or impossible. The source of an attack may be masked by a variety of techniques including botnet, proxy servers and onion routing. Identifying an IP address as the source of an attack does not offer conclusive evidence about the identity and intention of the perpetrator (Council, 2010). The inherent difficulty of attribution was demonstrated by the hacking of French television channel, TV5 Monde, in April 2015. The sophisticated incident was initially identified as an act of the Islamic State, but was later found more likely to be the handiwork of Russian-based hackers (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Several types of sanctions are available that might be justified by a legal chain of attribution. Available sanctions include economic punishment, denial of participation in future international treaties and agreements, hack-back countermeasures, unilateral and multilateral action and military responses.\n## 5. International rules relating to the responsibilities of states and non-state actors\nThe importance of attribution becomes clear in the discussion of state responsibility since it is essential for states to sanction responsible malicious actors. In addition, attribution assists a state in claiming legitimacy for sanctions or countermeasures. The purpose of the law is to determine the outcome of a conflict while legitimizing that outcome determination to others. Such sanctions are applied in the context of international law and international relations, since in this context states lack an overarching authority to compel compliance via force. Therefore, they need to operate under norms established and legitimized by customary international law (Goldsmith &amp; Posner, 1999).\nCyber capabilities can be used in a range of ways. There are two main types of cyber-attack which are most often applied by non-state actors employed by states. The first is cyber-enabled espionage – at the strategic or operational level – which compromises the confidentiality of information and information systems and has the potential to distribute secrets and sensitive information to adversaries. The second type is cyber-enabled\n504\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nsabotage, which can cause severe physical ramifications, especially when targeting infrastructure such as energy or transportation networks or when used to confuse the target and undermine command and control decision-making by manipulation (Robinson, 2016).\nAs mentioned previously, attribution is necessary to validate subsequent legal action. In order to do this, states need to identify the source of an attack as well as legitimize its attribution to the satisfaction of other state actors in order to justify whatever recourse or countermeasure follows (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017). In the context of attribution, the same adjustment of law can account for differences in punishment after the attribution of an attack to a state. Different states may interpret mens rea in different ways since states are composed of a multitude of individuals with a variety of mindsets. However, it is possible for states to adjust their standards of scrutiny of the law of attribution based on the burden of proof it requires. The standard of proof as a core element of procedure can be notched higher or lower based on the severity of the chosen remedy. The mens rea requirement is only one means of fine tuning the burden of proof, while the evidentiary standard of proof presents another holistic way to incorporate the seriousness of a penalty into the generalized requirements of a procedural framework.\nA recent Cyber Conflict Project carried out by Yale University's Centre for Global Legal Challenges contributes significantly to the discussion of this matter by proposing the application of an adversarial legal framework, i.e. one primarily characterized by impartial decision makers issuing judgments on disputes based on evidence and arguments presented by parties and legal representatives (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017). The adversarial model is well suited to the context of attribution since attribution frequently relies on technical evidence and concerned parties are in the best position to acquire and present such evidence. The adversarial system for an attribution framework points the way towards a general rule of what a widely accepted law of attribution in respect of cyber infringements might look like. A significant advantage of the adversarial system is that it has an impartial adjudicator and will be driven by the concerned parties in terms of both legal argumentation and the production of facts and evidence. The Centre for Global Legal Challenges argued that the current consensus on a preponderance of the evidence standard fits the goals of attribution as it provides the optimal balance of deterrence and information production since it lowers the barriers to the establishment of attribution (and hence, increases the potential for countermeasures) while still requiring a requisite level of persuasion that would incentivize the production of relevant intelligence and information regarding the cyber-attack. When it is ruled that a state is responsible for launching a cyber-attack as a result of the above-mentioned steps being carried out, the accused state might attempt to defend itself from attribution by placing the blame on a non-state actor. Therefore, the law of attribution comes into play by following the trail to an individual hacker and then attempting to connect that person to a state in terms of legal responsibility. The doctrine of state responsibility has long existed beyond the realm of cyber-attacks and has been addressed frequently in other contexts. International law already possesses a state responsibility doctrine for attributing the malicious behaviour of non-state actors to states.\nInternational Law Commission Draft Articles (2001) sets out ways for international states to be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors. Articles 4 and 8 of the Draft have been recognized as customary international law by the ICJ and are held to set the standard interpretation of the state responsibility doctrine. Both the first and second edition of the Tallinn Manual draw on the ILC's Draft Articles to formulate their conception of the state responsibility doctrine in the context of cyber-attacks. According to the Draft, if a non-state actor is acting as an organ of the state or is acting under the instructions, directions, or control of the state, the wrongful behaviour of the non-state actor is attributable to that state. It also holds actions attributable to a state in cases where the action has been conducted by individuals who may be recognized as organs of the state. It also extends to individuals who may be considered de facto organs of the state (Scharf &amp; Day, 2012). It has been understood that the conditions described in Article 4 and 8 set tests for the notion of control. Such control tests have been employed in rulings by courts such as the ICJ.\nThere is currently a significant debate about the limitations of the existing international law as regards state responsibility. The current framework was criticized by Oona Hathaway, who argued that states can still escape responsibility by handing illegal tasks to non-state actors. She also believes that the control test may actually disincentivize state efforts to control rogue or malicious behaviour, since that test might make it impossible to hold the state responsible for wrongdoing. The control doctrine is also criticized by Peter Margulies, who notes that it requires specific, comprehensive control to be established, and claims that such a standard would exclude very significant examples of states directing non-state actors to conduct cyber-attacks. These comments led to\n505\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nthe proposition of a solution, the \"virtual test\". This test, suggested by Margulies, shifts the burden to states to demonstrate non-responsibility in cases where states funds and equip private entities or parties who engage in cyber-attacks. According to Hathaway, this approach carries risks as the potential attachment of liability to any existing relationship between the government and a non-state actor who has carried out wrongful acts might incentivize governments to relinquish control over non-state actors within its reach. The argument might be made that the \"funding and equipping\" requirement is an indicator of state contribution and must be followed by the control test, will be applied only in cases that states materially supports such entities. Further, the concept of funding and/or equipping a non-state entity is not clearly defined by Margulies. Hathaway further notes that states should have access to an affirmative defence if they can prove that they took reasonable steps to prevent violations of international law.\nThe combined weight of the above arguments could support the proposition that the law of attribution, properly re-interpreted and applied to cyber situations, may potentially be useful in addressing the novel challenges of cyber-attack attribution. The virtual control test along with an affirmative defence of \"reasonable care\" would allow the doctrine of attribution to attribute individuals' cyber-attacks to states, while allowing states sufficient means of protecting themselves from liability by taking good faith measures to prevent wrongdoing (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017).\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe Stuxnet cyber-attack revealed how vulnerable states are to cyber-attack and how important it is for states to protect their national critical infrastructure. The attack indicated that while the threat of cyber-attacks has grown rapidly, response capabilities have not kept pace. The difficulty and uncertainty in tracing cyber-attack and attributing them correctly must lead states to prioritize cyber resilience. Cyber resilience interweaves different temporal strands which reinforce long-term security for protection of critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience abilities can affect opponents' decision-making and deter the deployment of attacks. As such, cyber resilience constitutes a form of cyber defence and enables states to protect national infrastructure which may otherwise be targeted by terrorist organizations. Damage to critical infrastructure can bring states to their knees. Having a comprehensive cyber resilience policy implies the ability to verify where cyber-attacks originate, to establish advance cyber policy and to having the ability to deploy traceback and related forensic tools which can go some way towards establishing attribution. Establishing an attribution policy is the first step in developing an advanced cyber resilience policy.\nThis discussion has shown how important it is for states to establish effective cyber resilience policies to face new and growing threats. This is particularly important for highly developed and connected countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and others, and such states are already taking steps towards such policies. The discussion has also shown how the concept of attribution and its applicability to state actors behind non-state wrongdoers may be used by states to justify counter measures. The doctrine of state responsibility serves as a means to establish responsibility of states for the acts of non-state actors in specific conditions. Although concerns have been raised by scholars such as Hathaway and Margulies, the law of attribution is currently poised to develop in new and fruitful ways in order to address novel challenges. The doctrine of attribution may be used to protect states from liability in appropriate cases which also allowing for the attribution of individuals' cyber-attacks to states."

The 'fifth dimension war' portrays 'cyber warfare' as a new battlefield which impels states to protect their critical infrastructure against attacks. Large-scale disruption of critical infrastructure caused by cyber-attacks undermines confidence in the state, emphasizing outdated security policies. It is difficult to accurately attribute the source, purpose or motives of cyber-attacks. The anonymity conferred by encrypting and hiding the sources of attack facilitates the implementation of cyber-attacks by terrorist organizations. It is impossible to prevent all attacks on critical infrastructure, even if protection measures are implemented appropriately. This implies that technology and updated infrastructure alone are not sufficient as a response. Additional measures along with specific procedures to facilitate faster recovery of assets that have suffered cyber-attacks are essential in responding to damage to critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience's key concepts such as prevention, preparedness and response are the new policies of developed regions. This article aims to further illuminate the underlying principles of national critical infrastructure defence in cyber warfare with the objective of providing a cyber resilience strategy. It also attempts to examine the issue of attribution and the applicability of international rules to state and non-state actors for malicious cyber activities in the context of attribution. The examination is conducted via a multilevel legal analysis.\nKeywords: cyber resilience, attribution, cyber terrorism, critical infrastructure, international law # 1. Introduction The nature of cyberspace, which is constantly changing and provides good cover and anonymity, makes the origin of cyber-attacks very difficult to pinpoint. Critical assets and information structures must be better understood, protected and maintained against cyber threats. Technical skills to counter the growing risk of cyber threats are limited. Often the weaknesses found in organizations in post-event analysis include porous controls around intrusion detection, monitoring and incident response. To counter this, organizations must subject their code and their systems to both internal and external examination to ensure robust cyber security configurations able to withstand attack. Critical capabilities include not just prevention and protection strategies but those enabling them to recover quickly following attacks or absorb and frustrate such attacks.\nCyber resilience helps rebalance the cost-benefit calculation in favour of defenders. All nations, particularly those at most risk, should reorient their policies based on this principle. Due to rapid technological advances, it is critical for nations to develop, implement and adhere to recovery plans that enable them to re-establish operational capacity after cyber-attacks.. Cyber capability is considered an integral part of the strategic diplomacy of all countries. However, evidence shows that states also have an interest in employing the cyber capabilities of non-state actors, and that they use either espionage or sabotage to execute attacks that are below the threshold of armed attack to in order to protect themselves from potential punishment.\nStatistical estimates imply that significant cyber vulnerabilities and hazards may leave the critical infrastructure of countries open to attack and even incapacitation. That is, cyber criminals now have the ability to 'crash' critical systems by exploiting cyber weaknesses due to the increasing penetration of the Internet. It is because of this that despite the existence of a broad legal regime to combat cybercrime, it is problematic to legally classify a cyber-attack against infrastructure as a use of force or an armed attack. There are many reasons why it is difficult to apply the rules of international humanitarian law to cyber-attacks. Chief among these is the difficulty of estimating the impact of a given cyber-attack in a proper manner and determining the identity and political motivation of the perpetrator/s. International groups of experts have attempted to address these issues by the creation of the Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the so-called\"Tallinn Manual\") which is the most comprehensive existing guide to the applicability of international law rules to cyber conflict, cyber warfare and cyber-attacks (Pipyros, Mitrou, Gritzalis, &amp; Apostolopoulos, 2016).\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani Despite such progress, there is still confusion regarding the applicability of international law to cyber warfare. State and non-state actors may use cyber-attacks in the context of military operations. In recent events, cyber-attacks have been used as part of hybrid warfare. Cyber hacking by states is not expressly regulated or controlled in the current international regime. There is no specific principle of international law applicable, and specific treaties that expressly regulate the use of cyber-attacks have not yet been developed. While scholars point to the potential application of the law of armed conflict, this law has not been invoked thus far to respond to cyber-attacks.\nThis article explores the term ‘national critical infrastructure’ and considers ways in which such infrastructure can be targeted in cyber-attacks. It then discusses the notion of cyber resilience as an alternative to deterring cyber-attacks. The discussion of cyber resilience is followed by a discussion of the issue of attribution as an element of a resilience strategy, since a possible response to cyber-attack requires identifying the offender and responding accordingly. Finally, the article demonstrates how existing international law can be applied to cyber warfare, how it is deficient and what may be done to improve it.\n## 2. National critical infrastructure Critical infrastructure refers to assets which are fundamental to the functioning of a society, that is, infrastructure which provides essential services which underpin the functioning of a society. It constitutes the ‘backbone’ of a nation’s economy, security, and health (\"What Is Critical Infrastructure?\"2017). Critical infrastructure also includes certain functions, sites and organizations which although not critical to the maintenance of essential services need protection due to the potential danger to the public their malfunction may cause, such as nuclear and chemical sites (\"Critical National Infrastructure,\"2018). A good example of disruption of critical infrastructure, and possibly the most instructive example to date, is the Stuxnet attack of 2010 which caused substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program. Critical infrastructure is defined and viewed differently in different countries due to divergent perspectives on issues such as national interest, security policy and defence development. It is commonly analysed by sectors; the United States has 16 sectors, while the UK has 13. (Lopez, Setola, &amp; Wolthusen, 2012).\nThe term ‘critical national infrastructure’ is defined by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) in the UK as: “those facilities, systems and sites necessary for the delivery of the essential services upon which daily life... depends and which ensure the country continues to function socially and economically” (Current and emerging trends in cyber operations: Policy, strategy and practice, 2015). Following an attempted spear-phishing attack, the CPNI released new guidance to educate the public which explained spear-phishing as “a targeted form of email deception that results in exploitation or compromise of individual devices and organizational networks”. It also explained more complex issues such as geo-spatial and multidimensional boundaries and hierarchical control systems such as SCADA systems across the UK. The potential threats posed to national interests have motivated all stakeholders to ensure cyber initiatives are coordinated in line with national risk assessments which were previously established.\nThe situation in the United States is somewhat different from that in the UK. Attempts to protect critical infrastructure commenced under President George W. Bush following the 2007 distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Estonia. His government established the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 which was declassified in March 2010 when President Barak Obama released public information on the CNCI and its main recommendations. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which evolved from concepts introduced in 2008, outlines how government and private sector participants in the critical infrastructure community can work together to manage risks and achieve security and resilience outcomes by 2013. It is updated regularly based on risk, policy, and strategic environments. It attempts to provide a foundation for an integrated approach to achieve\"[a] nation in which physical and cyber critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced, consequences minimized, threats identified and disrupted, and response and recovery hastened.\"\nThe existence of national critical infrastructure enables perpetrators to attack strategic targets without physical intervention for the first time in history. It is widely perceived that the target of cyber-terrorists is critical infrastructure. The recent examples of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure indicate the ongoing vulnerabilities and illustrate the urgent need to replace protection with resilience. A proper level of cyber security cannot be achieved without the necessary effort to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure.\n\n## 3. Cyber resilience strategy\nResilience in terms of cyber infrastructure is commonly understood as the capability of the critical infrastructure or service to either rapidly “bounce back” following an attack or absorb and frustrate the potential of attacks. Such strategies are complementary to existing prevention and protection policies which are the pillars of current critical infrastructure protection programs. Heath-Kelly defines resilience as “attempts to avoid security failure through retrospective, anticipatory and “decapitalized” operations, rather than actually addressing disaster recovery” .\nThere was no definition before the 1990s for the term ‘critical infrastructure’. . The term appears to have been introduced in recognition of a world which deals with imminent threats which lead to the development in advance of resilience strategies able to confront emergent disasters which must be thought of, prepared for, and dealt with continuously. Scholars have divided resilience into different categories with various typologies. Theoretical resilience scholarship focuses on how resilience is suited to liberal notions of security, while empirical resilience scholarship attempts to put the policy-driven incorporation of resilience into a growing number of social domains. Governmental resilience philosophy depicts resilience as an optimal recovery from an adverse event through security processes (Dunn Cavelty et al., 2015). Technologies also need to be prepared for the actual process of ‘coping’ which makes the resilience discourse “a discourse of futurity” . This discussion has brought scholars to the point that, although there are some contradictions in the existing literature on what resilience is and how different types of resilience work, resilience needs to be studied in many different forms and contexts. It is no longer the only paradigm with security relevance.\n## 4. Deterrent strategy and attribution\nThe structure and the anonymity of the internet and the difficulty in identifying the person behind the attack rather than the source machine of an attack and are highly salient to the issue of attribution to individuals or states (“The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,” 2017). This concern implies the need to create a legal solution to the problems posed by attribution. The combination of all these pieces of the puzzle makes it difficult to create actual legal or political frameworks for attribution (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Making a successful attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process requiring careful management, training, and leadership. Attribution is a political stakes game and governments must invest in identifying the perpetrators based on the damage level and importance of the target. Individual governments must decide how to approach attribution and when attribution has been established well enough for action. Attribution is important for governments since any response to a specific offence requires first identifying the offender. In many cases, the challenges of establishing attribution allow offenders to stay online and hide their identity behind the attribution problem.\nThe difficulty in detecting malicious threats that affect networks causes many intrusions to go unpunished. Policy makers attempt to utilize deterrence, which has been used throughout history as a useful tool to discourage unwanted behaviour. States use this policy as rational actors who try to make decisions via cost-benefit analyses. Such deterrence can be done by changing the decision-making calculus, punishment and denial (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Deterrence by punishment features prominently in the national security strategy of various countries. During the Cold War it was widely used and played a fundamental role. The most industrialised and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage in this respect. States need to identify the ‘red line’ to distinguish between accepted and unaccepted behaviour for punishment. Threats must also be supported by the ability, resources and intent to follow through by inflicting punishment, and punishment needs to be appropriate and informed by contemporary norms and international law. The deterrent by punishment approach is the most popular defensive approach, partly due to its high profile during the Cold War; other approaches are not as popular due to the difficult nature of their application. The US, the UK and Australia have attempted to achieve deterrence through a combination of punishment and denial in order to pursue their cyber stability by covering all bases and establishing a level of complexity in applying deterrence concepts to cyberspace. It must be borne in mind that deterring cyber actions through threat is not as easy as deterring physical attacks. Establishing a deterrent framework requires a variety of steps which are quite difficult and complicated to carry out in cyber space. Obstacles to effective deterrence include establishing a threshold, communicating threats, detecting intrusions and attributing responsibility.\n\nAs mentioned above, distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is significant since it draws the ‘red line’. It is necessary for the deterrence policy to define clearly the punishable behaviour. According to current definitions, a cyber-attack must cause physical destruction or loss of life. Therefore, other malicious acts such as cybercrime and cyber espionage do not attain the threshold. It is important that this grey zone be defined since it needs to be addressed in national security policy. Appropriate punishments for malicious behaviour must be defined not only to comply with international law but also to draw a direct connection between the behaviour and the punishment to reinforce the deterrence policy. According to the principle of proportionality, the retaliation must reflect the scale and scope of the original act. It is necessary to agree on what constitutes an appropriate response to cyber acts and how to distinguish between them to establish international cyber norms. A framework has been proposed by Tobias Feakin, Australia's inaugural Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to identify proportionate real-world responses to different types of cyber incidents; however, it the framework has not been officially adopted and integrated into international normative behaviour at this time. Another issue regarding deterrence strategies is that in most cases malicious activities remain unpunished as the threats do not cross the chosen threshold. The difficulty in detecting all malicious incidents also affects deterrence strategy and many intrusions go unpunished. Basically, all threats that are lower than the threshold remain unpunished, which undermines deterrent threats. The approach of online actors is to launch numerous low-intensity attacks to remain unnoticed; in case any single act is detected, that act is likely to fall below an adversary’s threshold for retaliation. The assumption is that these actions will probably either not be noticed or will not trigger a response. The ability to avoid retaliation by use of the strategy outlined above causes the credibility of retaliation threats to be undermined.\nThe immediacy of a punishment is also very important as it correlates with its effectiveness in establishing a deterrent. The time lapse between the crossing of a red line and the associated retribution make it difficult to identify the connection between the two. Thus, the challenges of detecting the offender affect a defender’s ability to establish deterrence by punishment in cyber space. Such inconsistency confuses public perception of thresholds and reduces the credibility of the deterrence posture. This disparity between the broad range of potential actions in cyber space, weak detection and unclear response frameworks is yet to be effectively addressed. Notwithstanding the fact that effective attribution offers multiple benefits such as strengthening the existing deterrence framework and improving collective security, the difficulty of accurately attributing responsibility makes it hard to establish a credible deterrent threat (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). The attribution process in cyberspace is challenging, and even if the perpetrator has been identified by the cyber forensic specialist, the process of imposing punishment is often slow, unreliable or impossible. The source of an attack may be masked by a variety of techniques including botnet, proxy servers and onion routing. Identifying an IP address as the source of an attack does not offer conclusive evidence about the identity and intention of the perpetrator. The inherent difficulty of attribution was demonstrated by the hacking of French television channel, TV5 Monde, in April 2015. The sophisticated incident was initially identified as an act of the Islamic State, but was later found more likely to be the handiwork of Russian-based hackers (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Several types of sanctions are available that might be justified by a legal chain of attribution. Available sanctions include economic punishment, denial of participation in future international treaties and agreements, hack-back countermeasures, unilateral and multilateral action and military responses.\n## 5. International rules relating to the responsibilities of states and non-state actors The importance of attribution becomes clear in the discussion of state responsibility since it is essential for states to sanction responsible malicious actors. In addition, attribution assists a state in claiming legitimacy for sanctions or countermeasures. The purpose of the law is to determine the outcome of a conflict while legitimizing that outcome determination to others. Such sanctions are applied in the context of international law and international relations, since in this context states lack an overarching authority to compel compliance via force. Therefore, they need to operate under norms established and legitimized by customary international law (Goldsmith &amp; Posner, 1999).\nCyber capabilities can be used in a range of ways. There are two main types of cyber-attack which are most often applied by non-state actors employed by states. The first is cyber-enabled espionage – at the strategic or operational level – which compromises the confidentiality of information and information systems and has the potential to distribute secrets and sensitive information to adversaries. The second type is cyber-enabled sabotage, which can cause severe physical ramifications, especially when targeting infrastructure such as energy or transportation networks or when used to confuse the target and undermine command and control decision-making by manipulation.\nAs mentioned previously, attribution is necessary to validate subsequent legal action. In order to do this, states need to identify the source of an attack as well as legitimize its attribution to the satisfaction of other state actors in order to justify whatever recourse or countermeasure follows (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017). In the context of attribution, the same adjustment of law can account for differences in punishment after the attribution of an attack to a state. Different states may interpret mens rea in different ways since states are composed of a multitude of individuals with a variety of mindsets. However, it is possible for states to adjust their standards of scrutiny of the law of attribution based on the burden of proof it requires. The standard of proof as a core element of procedure can be notched higher or lower based on the severity of the chosen remedy. The mens rea requirement is only one means of fine tuning the burden of proof, while the evidentiary standard of proof presents another holistic way to incorporate the seriousness of a penalty into the generalized requirements of a procedural framework.\nA recent Cyber Conflict Project carried out by Yale University's Centre for Global Legal Challenges contributes significantly to the discussion of this matter by proposing the application of an adversarial legal framework, i.e. one primarily characterized by impartial decision makers issuing judgments on disputes based on evidence and arguments presented by parties and legal representatives (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017). The adversarial model is well suited to the context of attribution since attribution frequently relies on technical evidence and concerned parties are in the best position to acquire and present such evidence. The adversarial system for an attribution framework points the way towards a general rule of what a widely accepted law of attribution in respect of cyber infringements might look like. A significant advantage of the adversarial system is that it has an impartial adjudicator and will be driven by the concerned parties in terms of both legal argumentation and the production of facts and evidence. The Centre for Global Legal Challenges argued that the current consensus on a preponderance of the evidence standard fits the goals of attribution as it provides the optimal balance of deterrence and information production since it lowers the barriers to the establishment of attribution (and hence, increases the potential for countermeasures) while still requiring a requisite level of persuasion that would incentivize the production of relevant intelligence and information regarding the cyber-attack. When it is ruled that a state is responsible for launching a cyber-attack as a result of the above-mentioned steps being carried out, the accused state might attempt to defend itself from attribution by placing the blame on a non-state actor. Therefore, the law of attribution comes into play by following the trail to an individual hacker and then attempting to connect that person to a state in terms of legal responsibility. The doctrine of state responsibility has long existed beyond the realm of cyber-attacks and has been addressed frequently in other contexts. International law already possesses a state responsibility doctrine for attributing the malicious behaviour of non-state actors to states.\nInternational Law Commission Draft Articles (2001) sets out ways for international states to be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors. Articles 4 and 8 of the Draft have been recognized as customary international law by the ICJ and are held to set the standard interpretation of the state responsibility doctrine. Both the first and second edition of the Tallinn Manual draw on the ILC's Draft Articles to formulate their conception of the state responsibility doctrine in the context of cyber-attacks. According to the Draft, if a non-state actor is acting as an organ of the state or is acting under the instructions, directions, or control of the state, the wrongful behaviour of the non-state actor is attributable to that state. It also holds actions attributable to a state in cases where the action has been conducted by individuals who may be recognized as organs of the state. It also extends to individuals who may be considered de facto organs of the state (Scharf &amp; Day, 2012). It has been understood that the conditions described in Article 4 and 8 set tests for the notion of control. Such control tests have been employed in rulings by courts such as the ICJ.\nThere is currently a significant debate about the limitations of the existing international law as regards state responsibility. The current framework was criticized by Oona Hathaway, who argued that states can still escape responsibility by handing illegal tasks to non-state actors. She also believes that the control test may actually disincentivize state efforts to control rogue or malicious behaviour, since that test might make it impossible to hold the state responsible for wrongdoing. The control doctrine is also criticized by Peter Margulies, who notes that it requires specific, comprehensive control to be established, and claims that such a standard would exclude very significant examples of states directing non-state actors to conduct cyber-attacks. These comments led to the proposition of a solution, the\"virtual test\". This test, suggested by Margulies, shifts the burden to states to demonstrate non-responsibility in cases where states funds and equip private entities or parties who engage in cyber-attacks. According to Hathaway, this approach carries risks as the potential attachment of liability to any existing relationship between the government and a non-state actor who has carried out wrongful acts might incentivize governments to relinquish control over non-state actors within its reach. The argument might be made that the\"funding and equipping\"requirement is an indicator of state contribution and must be followed by the control test, will be applied only in cases that states materially supports such entities. Further, the concept of funding and/or equipping a non-state entity is not clearly defined by Margulies. Hathaway further notes that states should have access to an affirmative defence if they can prove that they took reasonable steps to prevent violations of international law.\nThe combined weight of the above arguments could support the proposition that the law of attribution, properly re-interpreted and applied to cyber situations, may potentially be useful in addressing the novel challenges of cyber-attack attribution. The virtual control test along with an affirmative defence of\"reasonable care\"would allow the doctrine of attribution to attribute individuals' cyber-attacks to states, while allowing states sufficient means of protecting themselves from liability by taking good faith measures to prevent wrongdoing (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\"2017).\n## 6. Conclusion The Stuxnet cyber-attack revealed how vulnerable states are to cyber-attack and how important it is for states to protect their national critical infrastructure. The attack indicated that while the threat of cyber-attacks has grown rapidly, response capabilities have not kept pace. The difficulty and uncertainty in tracing cyber-attack and attributing them correctly must lead states to prioritize cyber resilience. Cyber resilience interweaves different temporal strands which reinforce long-term security for protection of critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience abilities can affect opponents' decision-making and deter the deployment of attacks. As such, cyber resilience constitutes a form of cyber defence and enables states to protect national infrastructure which may otherwise be targeted by terrorist organizations. Damage to critical infrastructure can bring states to their knees. Having a comprehensive cyber resilience policy implies the ability to verify where cyber-attacks originate, to establish advance cyber policy and to having the ability to deploy traceback and related forensic tools which can go some way towards establishing attribution. Establishing an attribution policy is the first step in developing an advanced cyber resilience policy.\nThis discussion has shown how important it is for states to establish effective cyber resilience policies to face new and growing threats. This is particularly important for highly developed and connected countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and others, and such states are already taking steps towards such policies. The discussion has also shown how the concept of attribution and its applicability to state actors behind non-state wrongdoers may be used by states to justify counter measures. The doctrine of state responsibility serves as a means to establish responsibility of states for the acts of non-state actors in specific conditions. Although concerns have been raised by scholars such as Hathaway and Margulies, the law of attribution is currently poised to develop in new and fruitful ways in order to address novel challenges. The doctrine of attribution may be used to protect states from liability in appropriate cases which also allowing for the attribution of individuals' cyber-attacks to states."

    "501\n\n# Cyber Resilience Strategy and Attribution in the Context of International law\n\nPardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\nFaculty of Law, University of Malaya, Malaysia\npardismoslemzadeh@um.edu.my\n\nAbstract: Recent cyber-attacks around the globe, which are largely due to the emergence of the internet of things (IOT), indicate that what was until recently a futuristic threat has now become a reality. The 'fifth dimension war' portrays 'cyber warfare' as a new battlefield which impels states to protect their critical infrastructure against attacks. Large-scale disruption of critical infrastructure caused by cyber-attacks undermines confidence in the state, emphasizing outdated security policies. It is difficult to accurately attribute the source, purpose or motives of cyber-attacks. The anonymity conferred by encrypting and hiding the sources of attack facilitates the implementation of cyber-attacks by terrorist organizations. It is impossible to prevent all attacks on critical infrastructure, even if protection measures are implemented appropriately. This implies that technology and updated infrastructure alone are not sufficient as a response. Additional measures along with specific procedures to facilitate faster recovery of assets that have suffered cyber-attacks are essential in responding to damage to critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience's key concepts such as prevention, preparedness and response are the new policies of developed regions. This article aims to further illuminate the underlying principles of national critical infrastructure defence in cyber warfare with the objective of providing a cyber resilience strategy. It also attempts to examine the issue of attribution and the applicability of international rules to state and non-state actors for malicious cyber activities in the context of attribution. The examination is conducted via a multilevel legal analysis.\n\nKeywords: cyber resilience, attribution, cyber terrorism, critical infrastructure, international law\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThe nature of cyberspace, which is constantly changing and provides good cover and anonymity, makes the origin of cyber-attacks very difficult to pinpoint. Critical assets and information structures must be better understood, protected and maintained against cyber threats. Technical skills to counter the growing risk of cyber threats are limited. Often the weaknesses found in organizations in post-event analysis include porous controls around intrusion detection, monitoring and incident response. To counter this, organizations must subject their code and their systems to both internal and external examination to ensure robust cyber security configurations able to withstand attack. Critical capabilities include not just prevention and protection strategies but those enabling them to recover quickly following attacks or absorb and frustrate such attacks (Masys, 2015).\n\nCyber resilience helps rebalance the cost-benefit calculation in favour of defenders. All nations, particularly those at most risk, should reorient their policies based on this principle. Due to rapid technological advances, it is critical for nations to develop, implement and adhere to recovery plans that enable them to re-establish operational capacity after cyber-attacks. (Peter, 2017). Cyber capability is considered an integral part of the strategic diplomacy of all countries. However, evidence shows that states also have an interest in employing the cyber capabilities of non-state actors, and that they use either espionage or sabotage to execute attacks that are below the threshold of armed attack to in order to protect themselves from potential punishment (Robinson, 2016).\n\nStatistical estimates imply that significant cyber vulnerabilities and hazards may leave the critical infrastructure of countries open to attack and even incapacitation. That is, cyber criminals now have the ability to 'crash' critical systems by exploiting cyber weaknesses due to the increasing penetration of the Internet. It is because of this that despite the existence of a broad legal regime to combat cybercrime, it is problematic to legally classify a cyber-attack against infrastructure as a use of force or an armed attack. There are many reasons why it is difficult to apply the rules of international humanitarian law to cyber-attacks. Chief among these is the difficulty of estimating the impact of a given cyber-attack in a proper manner and determining the identity and political motivation of the perpetrator/s. International groups of experts have attempted to address these issues by the creation of the Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the so-called \"Tallinn Manual\") which is the most comprehensive existing guide to the applicability of international law rules to cyber conflict, cyber warfare and cyber-attacks (Pipyros, Mitrou, Gritzalis, &amp; Apostolopoulos, 2016).",
    "Pardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\n\nDespite such progress, there is still confusion regarding the applicability of international law to cyber warfare. State and non-state actors may use cyber-attacks in the context of military operations. In recent events, cyber-attacks have been used as part of hybrid warfare. Cyber hacking by states is not expressly regulated or controlled in the current international regime. There is no specific principle of international law applicable, and specific treaties that expressly regulate the use of cyber-attacks have not yet been developed. While scholars point to the potential application of the law of armed conflict, this law has not been invoked thus far to respond to cyber-attacks (Hathaway et al., 2012).\n\nThis article explores the term ‘national critical infrastructure’ and considers ways in which such infrastructure can be targeted in cyber-attacks. It then discusses the notion of cyber resilience as an alternative to deterring cyber-attacks. The discussion of cyber resilience is followed by a discussion of the issue of attribution as an element of a resilience strategy, since a possible response to cyber-attack requires identifying the offender and responding accordingly. Finally, the article demonstrates how existing international law can be applied to cyber warfare, how it is deficient and what may be done to improve it.\n\n## 2. National critical infrastructure\n\nCritical infrastructure refers to assets which are fundamental to the functioning of a society, that is, infrastructure which provides essential services which underpin the functioning of a society. It constitutes the ‘backbone’ of a nation’s economy, security, and health (\"What Is Critical Infrastructure?\" 2017). Critical infrastructure also includes certain functions, sites and organizations which although not critical to the maintenance of essential services need protection due to the potential danger to the public their malfunction may cause, such as nuclear and chemical sites (\"Critical National Infrastructure,\" 2018). A good example of disruption of critical infrastructure, and possibly the most instructive example to date, is the Stuxnet attack of 2010 which caused substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program. Critical infrastructure is defined and viewed differently in different countries due to divergent perspectives on issues such as national interest, security policy and defence development. It is commonly analysed by sectors; the United States has 16 sectors, while the UK has 13. (Lopez, Setola, &amp; Wolthusen, 2012).\n\nThe term ‘critical national infrastructure’ is defined by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) in the UK as: “those facilities, systems and sites necessary for the delivery of the essential services upon which daily life ... depends and which ensure the country continues to function socially and economically” (Current and emerging trends in cyber operations: Policy, strategy and practice, 2015). Following an attempted spear-phishing attack, the CPNI released new guidance to educate the public which explained spear-phishing as “a targeted form of email deception that results in exploitation or compromise of individual devices and organizational networks”. It also explained more complex issues such as geo-spatial and multidimensional boundaries and hierarchical control systems such as SCADA systems across the UK. The potential threats posed to national interests have motivated all stakeholders to ensure cyber initiatives are coordinated in line with national risk assessments which were previously established (Lemieux, 2015).\n\nThe situation in the United States is somewhat different from that in the UK. Attempts to protect critical infrastructure commenced under President George W. Bush following the 2007 distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Estonia. His government established the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 which was declassified in March 2010 when President Barak Obama released public information on the CNCI and its main recommendations. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which evolved from concepts introduced in 2008, outlines how government and private sector participants in the critical infrastructure community can work together to manage risks and achieve security and resilience outcomes by 2013. It is updated regularly based on risk, policy, and strategic environments. It attempts to provide a foundation for an integrated approach to achieve \"[a] nation in which physical and cyber critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced, consequences minimized, threats identified and disrupted, and response and recovery hastened.\"\n\nThe existence of national critical infrastructure enables perpetrators to attack strategic targets without physical intervention for the first time in history. It is widely perceived that the target of cyber-terrorists is critical infrastructure. The recent examples of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure indicate the ongoing vulnerabilities and illustrate the urgent need to replace protection with resilience. A proper level of cyber security cannot be achieved without the necessary effort to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure.\n\n502",
    "Pardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\n\n## 3. Cyber resilience strategy\n\nResilience in terms of cyber infrastructure is commonly understood as the capability of the critical infrastructure or service to either rapidly “bounce back” following an attack or absorb and frustrate the potential of attacks. Such strategies are complementary to existing prevention and protection policies which are the pillars of current critical infrastructure protection programs. Heath-Kelly defines resilience as “attempts to avoid security failure through retrospective, anticipatory and “decapitalized” operations, rather than actually addressing disaster recovery” (Heath-Kelly, 2015).\n\nThere was no definition before the 1990s for the term ‘critical infrastructure’. (Lewis, 2014). The term appears to have been introduced in recognition of a world which deals with imminent threats which lead to the development in advance of resilience strategies able to confront emergent disasters which must be thought of, prepared for, and dealt with continuously. Scholars have divided resilience into different categories with various typologies. Theoretical resilience scholarship focuses on how resilience is suited to liberal notions of security, while empirical resilience scholarship attempts to put the policy-driven incorporation of resilience into a growing number of social domains. Governmental resilience philosophy depicts resilience as an optimal recovery from an adverse event through security processes (Dunn Cavelty et al., 2015). Technologies also need to be prepared for the actual process of ‘coping’ which makes the resilience discourse “a discourse of futurity” (Schott, 2013). This discussion has brought scholars to the point that, although there are some contradictions in the existing literature on what resilience is and how different types of resilience work, resilience needs to be studied in many different forms and contexts. It is no longer the only paradigm with security relevance.\n\n## 4. Deterrent strategy and attribution\n\nThe structure and the anonymity of the internet and the difficulty in identifying the person behind the attack rather than the source machine of an attack and are highly salient to the issue of attribution to individuals or states (“The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,” 2017). This concern implies the need to create a legal solution to the problems posed by attribution. The combination of all these pieces of the puzzle makes it difficult to create actual legal or political frameworks for attribution (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Making a successful attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process requiring careful management, training, and leadership. Attribution is a political stakes game and governments must invest in identifying the perpetrators based on the damage level and importance of the target. Individual governments must decide how to approach attribution and when attribution has been established well enough for action. Attribution is important for governments since any response to a specific offence requires first identifying the offender. In many cases, the challenges of establishing attribution allow offenders to stay online and hide their identity behind the attribution problem.\n\nThe difficulty in detecting malicious threats that affect networks causes many intrusions to go unpunished. Policy makers attempt to utilize deterrence, which has been used throughout history as a useful tool to discourage unwanted behaviour. States use this policy as rational actors who try to make decisions via cost-benefit analyses. Such deterrence can be done by changing the decision-making calculus, punishment and denial (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Deterrence by punishment features prominently in the national security strategy of various countries. During the Cold War it was widely used and played a fundamental role. The most industrialised and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage in this respect. States need to identify the ‘red line’ to distinguish between accepted and unaccepted behaviour for punishment. Threats must also be supported by the ability, resources and intent to follow through by inflicting punishment, and punishment needs to be appropriate and informed by contemporary norms and international law. The deterrent by punishment approach is the most popular defensive approach, partly due to its high profile during the Cold War; other approaches are not as popular due to the difficult nature of their application. The US, the UK and Australia have attempted to achieve deterrence through a combination of punishment and denial in order to pursue their cyber stability by covering all bases and establishing a level of complexity in applying deterrence concepts to cyberspace. It must be borne in mind that deterring cyber actions through threat is not as easy as deterring physical attacks. Establishing a deterrent framework requires a variety of steps which are quite difficult and complicated to carry out in cyber space. Obstacles to effective deterrence include establishing a threshold, communicating threats, detecting intrusions and attributing responsibility.\n\n503",
    "Pardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\n\nAs mentioned above, distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is significant since it draws the ‘red line’. It is necessary for the deterrence policy to define clearly the punishable behaviour. According to current definitions, a cyber-attack must cause physical destruction or loss of life. Therefore, other malicious acts such as cybercrime and cyber espionage do not attain the threshold. It is important that this grey zone be defined since it needs to be addressed in national security policy. Appropriate punishments for malicious behaviour must be defined not only to comply with international law but also to draw a direct connection between the behaviour and the punishment to reinforce the deterrence policy (Jensen, 2012). According to the principle of proportionality, the retaliation must reflect the scale and scope of the original act. It is necessary to agree on what constitutes an appropriate response to cyber acts and how to distinguish between them to establish international cyber norms. A framework has been proposed by Tobias Feakin, Australia's inaugural Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to identify proportionate real-world responses to different types of cyber incidents; however, it the framework has not been officially adopted and integrated into international normative behaviour at this time. (Feakin, 2015)\n\nAnother issue regarding deterrence strategies is that in most cases malicious activities remain unpunished as the threats do not cross the chosen threshold. The difficulty in detecting all malicious incidents also affects deterrence strategy and many intrusions go unpunished. Basically, all threats that are lower than the threshold remain unpunished, which undermines deterrent threats. The approach of online actors is to launch numerous low-intensity attacks to remain unnoticed; in case any single act is detected, that act is likely to fall below an adversary’s threshold for retaliation. The assumption is that these actions will probably either not be noticed or will not trigger a response. The ability to avoid retaliation by use of the strategy outlined above causes the credibility of retaliation threats to be undermined.\n\nThe immediacy of a punishment is also very important as it correlates with its effectiveness in establishing a deterrent. The time lapse between the crossing of a red line and the associated retribution make it difficult to identify the connection between the two. Thus, the challenges of detecting the offender affect a defender’s ability to establish deterrence by punishment in cyber space. Such inconsistency confuses public perception of thresholds and reduces the credibility of the deterrence posture. This disparity between the broad range of potential actions in cyber space, weak detection and unclear response frameworks is yet to be effectively addressed (Goodman, 2010). Notwithstanding the fact that effective attribution offers multiple benefits such as strengthening the existing deterrence framework and improving collective security, the difficulty of accurately attributing responsibility makes it hard to establish a credible deterrent threat (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). The attribution process in cyberspace is challenging, and even if the perpetrator has been identified by the cyber forensic specialist, the process of imposing punishment is often slow, unreliable or impossible. The source of an attack may be masked by a variety of techniques including botnet, proxy servers and onion routing. Identifying an IP address as the source of an attack does not offer conclusive evidence about the identity and intention of the perpetrator (Council, 2010). The inherent difficulty of attribution was demonstrated by the hacking of French television channel, TV5 Monde, in April 2015. The sophisticated incident was initially identified as an act of the Islamic State, but was later found more likely to be the handiwork of Russian-based hackers (Nevill &amp; Hawkins, 2016). Several types of sanctions are available that might be justified by a legal chain of attribution. Available sanctions include economic punishment, denial of participation in future international treaties and agreements, hack-back countermeasures, unilateral and multilateral action and military responses.\n\n## 5. International rules relating to the responsibilities of states and non-state actors\n\nThe importance of attribution becomes clear in the discussion of state responsibility since it is essential for states to sanction responsible malicious actors. In addition, attribution assists a state in claiming legitimacy for sanctions or countermeasures. The purpose of the law is to determine the outcome of a conflict while legitimizing that outcome determination to others. Such sanctions are applied in the context of international law and international relations, since in this context states lack an overarching authority to compel compliance via force. Therefore, they need to operate under norms established and legitimized by customary international law (Goldsmith &amp; Posner, 1999).\n\nCyber capabilities can be used in a range of ways. There are two main types of cyber-attack which are most often applied by non-state actors employed by states. The first is cyber-enabled espionage – at the strategic or operational level – which compromises the confidentiality of information and information systems and has the potential to distribute secrets and sensitive information to adversaries. The second type is cyber-enabled\n\n504",
    "Pardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\n\nsabotage, which can cause severe physical ramifications, especially when targeting infrastructure such as energy or transportation networks or when used to confuse the target and undermine command and control decision-making by manipulation (Robinson, 2016).\n\nAs mentioned previously, attribution is necessary to validate subsequent legal action. In order to do this, states need to identify the source of an attack as well as legitimize its attribution to the satisfaction of other state actors in order to justify whatever recourse or countermeasure follows (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017). In the context of attribution, the same adjustment of law can account for differences in punishment after the attribution of an attack to a state. Different states may interpret mens rea in different ways since states are composed of a multitude of individuals with a variety of mindsets. However, it is possible for states to adjust their standards of scrutiny of the law of attribution based on the burden of proof it requires. The standard of proof as a core element of procedure can be notched higher or lower based on the severity of the chosen remedy. The mens rea requirement is only one means of fine tuning the burden of proof, while the evidentiary standard of proof presents another holistic way to incorporate the seriousness of a penalty into the generalized requirements of a procedural framework.\n\nA recent Cyber Conflict Project carried out by Yale University's Centre for Global Legal Challenges contributes significantly to the discussion of this matter by proposing the application of an adversarial legal framework, i.e. one primarily characterized by impartial decision makers issuing judgments on disputes based on evidence and arguments presented by parties and legal representatives (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017). The adversarial model is well suited to the context of attribution since attribution frequently relies on technical evidence and concerned parties are in the best position to acquire and present such evidence. The adversarial system for an attribution framework points the way towards a general rule of what a widely accepted law of attribution in respect of cyber infringements might look like. A significant advantage of the adversarial system is that it has an impartial adjudicator and will be driven by the concerned parties in terms of both legal argumentation and the production of facts and evidence. The Centre for Global Legal Challenges argued that the current consensus on a preponderance of the evidence standard fits the goals of attribution as it provides the optimal balance of deterrence and information production since it lowers the barriers to the establishment of attribution (and hence, increases the potential for countermeasures) while still requiring a requisite level of persuasion that would incentivize the production of relevant intelligence and information regarding the cyber-attack. When it is ruled that a state is responsible for launching a cyber-attack as a result of the above-mentioned steps being carried out, the accused state might attempt to defend itself from attribution by placing the blame on a non-state actor. Therefore, the law of attribution comes into play by following the trail to an individual hacker and then attempting to connect that person to a state in terms of legal responsibility. The doctrine of state responsibility has long existed beyond the realm of cyber-attacks and has been addressed frequently in other contexts. International law already possesses a state responsibility doctrine for attributing the malicious behaviour of non-state actors to states.\n\nInternational Law Commission Draft Articles (2001) sets out ways for international states to be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors. Articles 4 and 8 of the Draft have been recognized as customary international law by the ICJ and are held to set the standard interpretation of the state responsibility doctrine. Both the first and second edition of the Tallinn Manual draw on the ILC's Draft Articles to formulate their conception of the state responsibility doctrine in the context of cyber-attacks. According to the Draft, if a non-state actor is acting as an organ of the state or is acting under the instructions, directions, or control of the state, the wrongful behaviour of the non-state actor is attributable to that state. It also holds actions attributable to a state in cases where the action has been conducted by individuals who may be recognized as organs of the state. It also extends to individuals who may be considered de facto organs of the state (Scharf &amp; Day, 2012). It has been understood that the conditions described in Article 4 and 8 set tests for the notion of control. Such control tests have been employed in rulings by courts such as the ICJ.\n\nThere is currently a significant debate about the limitations of the existing international law as regards state responsibility. The current framework was criticized by Oona Hathaway, who argued that states can still escape responsibility by handing illegal tasks to non-state actors. She also believes that the control test may actually disincentivize state efforts to control rogue or malicious behaviour, since that test might make it impossible to hold the state responsible for wrongdoing. The control doctrine is also criticized by Peter Margulies, who notes that it requires specific, comprehensive control to be established, and claims that such a standard would exclude very significant examples of states directing non-state actors to conduct cyber-attacks. These comments led to\n\n505",
    "Pardis Moslemzadeh Tehrani\n\nthe proposition of a solution, the \"virtual test\". This test, suggested by Margulies, shifts the burden to states to demonstrate non-responsibility in cases where states funds and equip private entities or parties who engage in cyber-attacks. According to Hathaway, this approach carries risks as the potential attachment of liability to any existing relationship between the government and a non-state actor who has carried out wrongful acts might incentivize governments to relinquish control over non-state actors within its reach. The argument might be made that the \"funding and equipping\" requirement is an indicator of state contribution and must be followed by the control test, will be applied only in cases that states materially supports such entities. Further, the concept of funding and/or equipping a non-state entity is not clearly defined by Margulies. Hathaway further notes that states should have access to an affirmative defence if they can prove that they took reasonable steps to prevent violations of international law.\n\nThe combined weight of the above arguments could support the proposition that the law of attribution, properly re-interpreted and applied to cyber situations, may potentially be useful in addressing the novel challenges of cyber-attack attribution. The virtual control test along with an affirmative defence of \"reasonable care\" would allow the doctrine of attribution to attribute individuals' cyber-attacks to states, while allowing states sufficient means of protecting themselves from liability by taking good faith measures to prevent wrongdoing (\"The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack,\" 2017).\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nThe Stuxnet cyber-attack revealed how vulnerable states are to cyber-attack and how important it is for states to protect their national critical infrastructure. The attack indicated that while the threat of cyber-attacks has grown rapidly, response capabilities have not kept pace. The difficulty and uncertainty in tracing cyber-attack and attributing them correctly must lead states to prioritize cyber resilience. Cyber resilience interweaves different temporal strands which reinforce long-term security for protection of critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience abilities can affect opponents' decision-making and deter the deployment of attacks. As such, cyber resilience constitutes a form of cyber defence and enables states to protect national infrastructure which may otherwise be targeted by terrorist organizations. Damage to critical infrastructure can bring states to their knees. Having a comprehensive cyber resilience policy implies the ability to verify where cyber-attacks originate, to establish advance cyber policy and to having the ability to deploy traceback and related forensic tools which can go some way towards establishing attribution. Establishing an attribution policy is the first step in developing an advanced cyber resilience policy.\n\nThis discussion has shown how important it is for states to establish effective cyber resilience policies to face new and growing threats. This is particularly important for highly developed and connected countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and others, and such states are already taking steps towards such policies. The discussion has also shown how the concept of attribution and its applicability to state actors behind non-state wrongdoers may be used by states to justify counter measures. The doctrine of state responsibility serves as a means to establish responsibility of states for the acts of non-state actors in specific conditions. Although concerns have been raised by scholars such as Hathaway and Margulies, the law of attribution is currently poised to develop in new and fruitful ways in order to address novel challenges. The doctrine of attribution may be used to protect states from liability in appropriate cases which also allowing for the attribution of individuals' cyber-attacks to states.\n\n## References\n\nCouncil, N.

    "abstract": "Recent cyber-attacks around the globe, which are largely due to the emergence of the internet of things (IOT), indicate that what was until recently a futuristic threat has now become a reality. The 'fifth dimension war' portrays 'cyber warfare' as a new battlefield which impels states to protect their critical infrastructure against attacks. Large-scale disruption of critical infrastructure caused by cyber-attacks undermines confidence in the state, emphasizing outdated security policies. It is difficult to accurately attribute the source, purpose or motives of cyber-attacks. The anonymity conferred by encrypting and hiding the sources of attack facilitates the implementation of cyber-attacks by terrorist organizations. It is impossible to prevent all attacks on critical infrastructure, even if protection measures are implemented appropriately. This implies that technology and updated infrastructure alone are not sufficient as a response. Additional measures along with specific procedures to facilitate faster recovery of assets that have suffered cyber-attacks are essential in responding to damage to critical infrastructure. Cyber resilience's key concepts such as prevention, preparedness and response are the new policies of developed regions. This article aims to further illuminate the underlying principles of national critical infrastructure defence in cyber warfare with the objective of providing a cyber resilience strategy. It also attempts to examine the issue of attribution and the applicability of international rules to state and non-state actors for malicious cyber activities in the context of attribution. The examination is conducted via a multilevel legal analysis.",
