Such jurisdiction is based on territoriality, passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace that spans the land, sea, air and outer space domains. In order to hold a State responsible for a cyber activity, that activity must be attributed to the State in accordance with international rules on attribution for the purpose of responsibility, including the applicable standard of proof. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the controversy surrounding alleged foreign interference by cyber means in the 2016 US Presidential election show the difficult challenges for the application of these rules. International organizations can be held accountable for cyber activities attributable to them, too.\nKeywords Jurisdiction in cyberspace • Attribution in cyberspace • State responsibility for cyber activities • 2014 Sony Pictures hacks and international law • Attribution for the 2016 US Presidential election hacks\n## 2.1 Jurisdiction¹\nWhile no State may claim sovereignty over cyberspace as such, States may exercise sovereign prerogatives over any cyber infrastructure situated on their territory as well as activities associated with that cyber infrastructure.² Such prerogatives\n¹ See, generally, Secretariat of the International Law Commission, *Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of the Fifty-eighth Session* (2006), UN Gen.

Jurisdiction to prescribe is the State's authority to legislate or prescribe law and regulations. Jurisdiction to enforce is the State's authority to enforce the law and regulations legislated or prescribed by it. There is also an adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts of the State to interpret its law and regulations.³\nJurisdiction is primarily territorial. A State may exercise jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure and over the intangible based on territoriality, including “subjective territorial jurisdiction” over an incident originating in a State’s territory but consummated elsewhere, and “objective territorial jurisdiction” over individuals where an incident has effects on the State’s territory although the act was initiated elsewhere.⁴ This territorial jurisdiction extends to the airspace superjacent to the land territory and territorial waters under the State’s sovereignty.⁵ For example, a State has jurisdiction over civilian aircraft with airborne cyber infrastructure to hack into Wi-Fi networks or eavesdrop on cell phone calls and text messages and to exfiltrate or otherwise interfere with data in the State’s territory being overflown and may order the aircraft to land to submit to the jurisdiction of the territorial State for violation of its law.⁶ In case of State aircraft, they must get prior authorization from the territorial State over which they intend to overfly, and the authorization may comprise conditions,⁷ violation of which entitles the territorial State to demand that the aircraft in question cease the violation and depart its airspace without delay, and, if the aircraft refuses, to take necessary and proportional measures against that aircraft.⁸\npersons coordinated by Prof. M. N. Schmitt, Chairman of the International Law Department at the United States Naval War College, at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The second part of the Tallinn Manual entitled Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017) was written by another group of experts including the present author of this book in 2015–2016 and will be hereinafter referred to as Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n“Cyber infrastructure” is defined as “the communication, storage, and computing resources upon which information systems operate” (Tallinn Manual, 15).\n³ Marko Milanovic, *Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 23–25.

Several States have also asserted jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender’s victim is a national of that State – this is based on the passive personality principle of jurisdiction. Three judges of the ICJ noted in February 2002 that passive personality jurisdiction, which was previously regarded as controversial, is now reflected in the legislation of various States including the US and France “and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so far as a particular category of offences is concerned”.¹⁰ The more serious the offences, the less likely that opposition to the exercise of passive personality jurisdiction will face. Passive personality jurisdiction is an option in, for example, the 1970 Hague Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 1985 Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture; the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance; the 1997 Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; the 1999 Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; the 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the 2006 Enforced Disappearance Convention; and the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism.\nA State may, based on the protective principle, exercise jurisdiction over the offender whose conduct abroad threatens that State’s security or interferes with the operation of its government functions.¹¹\nThe most controversial base of jurisdiction is universal jurisdiction, whereby a State asserts jurisdiction over a crime which has no connection (nexus) with that State at all. In other words, the crime is committed outside its territory, does not have any effect therein, and neither the perpetrator nor the victim is its national. It has long been accepted that every State may exercise universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of piracy. Apart from that, it is still controversial whether a State may exercise universal jurisdiction absent treaty obligations binding on the States concerned – as in the case of the obligation to prosecute or extradite commonly found\n⁹See further, Henrik Spang-Hanssen, Cyberspace &amp; International Law on Jurisdiction (Copenhagen: DJØF Publishing, 2004), chaps. 31, 32; Tallinn Manual, 18.\n¹⁰Para. 47 of the Joint Separate Opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal, Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Dem.

Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State. The development of the national organization of States during the last few centuries and, as a corollary, the development of international law, have established this principle of the exclusive competence of the State in regard to its own territory in such a way as to make it the point of departure in settling most questions that concern international relations.* (*Island of Palmas Case* (*Netherlands/United States of America*), Award of 4 April 1928, *UNRIAA*, vol.

The processing in cloud computing may occur in several States simultaneously. It is submitted that in this type of situation more than one State have concurrent jurisdiction over a crime committed via cloud computing, pursuant to any one of jurisdictional bases mentioned above insofar as it is applicable to the facts in question.\nCurrently, fibre-optic cables buried in the seabed are the main conduits of the Internet since satellites have limited capacity compared to cables and are, thus, much more expensive and their use is confined mainly to broadcasting as well as for Internet usage by communities in very remote regions.²¹\nA State has sovereignty over communication cables lying within its land territory, internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It can adopt laws and regulations to protect submarine cables in its territorial sea, for example.²² To accommodate the interest of existing submarine cables, the law of the sea as codified in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS) requires an archipelagic State, which is recognized pursuant to UNCLOS, to respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. In addition, an archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them.²³ In the maritime area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea called the “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State is measured, all States generally enjoy the freedom of the laying of submarine cables, with due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS and other rules of international law insofar as they are not incompatible therewith.²⁴ This freedom is permissible as it is not an exercise of sovereign rights over the natural resources which is reserved exclusively for the coastal State in whose EEZ the laying of submarine cables takes place.²⁵\n¹⁹ Nancy J.

All States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the continental shelf of another State. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables. The coastal State may set conditions for cables entering its land territory, internal waters or territorial sea. The coastal State also has jurisdiction over cables constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. When laying submarine cables, States are required to have due regard to cables already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables shall not be prejudiced.\nInternational law is silent as to whether and to what extent such cables are subject to the jurisdiction of the States that own them or whose nationals have laid and operate them. In particular, it is doubtful whether these States may take the measures necessary to protect their cables against malicious interference. Marine cables protection zones are permitted in the territorial sea, by virtue of Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS, but not in maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the case of submarine cables lying beyond the territorial sea, Article 113 of UNCLOS requires every State to criminalize their breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications. The provision predated the age of the Internet. Nevertheless, as fibre-optic cables are used in telecommunication that includes telephonic communications, the cables are covered under this UNCLOS provision. This provision applies also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, but it does not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury. Article 114 of UNCLOS requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable, cause a break in or injury to another cable, they shall bear the cost of the repairs. Article 115 requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.\nBesides UNCLOS, the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, in force since 1 May 1888, regulates interference with telegraph cables outside territorial waters of its Parties. It accords the competent jurisdiction to the court of the State in which the vessel in question is registered (“flag State”) and the State of nationality of the offender, in that order. The Convention makes it a punishable offence to break or injure a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages. This provision does not apply to cases where those who break or injure a cable do so with the lawful object of saving their lives or their ship, after they have taken every necessary precaution to avoid so breaking or injuring the cable. There are merely 41 States Parties to the 1884 Convention, though.\nWith regard to unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, Article 109 of UNCLOS requires all States to cooperate in its suppression. “Unauthorized broadcasting” is defined as “the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls”. This provision predated the era of the Internet, and one may question whether it covers transmission by cyber means. It is hereby submitted that if there is some cyber involvement in transmitting sound radio or television broadcast such as using cyber-facilitated means to stream radio and television via the Internet or to disseminate information, especially through social media platforms such as Twitter, vk.com, Facebook, this definition of broadcasting can be interpreted to cover transmission via the Internet. This present author agrees with the position of the majority of the experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the object and purpose of proscribing unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas are primarily the prevention of interference with broadcasting that is not in compliance with international regulations, such as the regulation of broadcasting frequencies, and produces negative effects on maritime or air communications. The posting of online material, including online propaganda, from the high seas poses no such risks and is not covered by this prohibition -- there is no difference whether online material is posted from a vessel in the high seas or on land. The following provisions on unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas must be understood in this context.\nArticle 109 of UNCLOS provides that any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas may be prosecuted before the court of: (a) the flag State of the ship from which the broadcast is made; (b) the State of registry of the installation from which the broadcast is made; (c) the State of which the person is a national; (d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or (e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference. The State having the said jurisdiction may, in conformity with Article 110 of UNCLOS, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus. Article 110 stipulates that, except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign\nship, other than a warship or a ship owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service, may board it if there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the foreign ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109; the foreign ship is without nationality; or though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship. Article 110 applies mutatis mutandis to military aircraft as well as to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service which encounter the suspected ship.\nUNCLOS is supplemented by other international instruments in this matter. For example, the 1965 European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations Outside National Territories regulates broadcasting stations which are installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other floating or airborne objects and which, outside national territories, transmit broadcasts intended for reception or capable of being received, wholly or in part, within the territory of any Contracting Party, or which cause harmful interference to any radio-communication service operating under the authority of a Contracting Party in accordance with the Radio Regulations. Each Contracting Party undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of the said broadcasting, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, apply the provisions of this Agreement in regard to its nationals who have committed any of the aforesaid offences on its territory, ships, or aircraft, or outside national territories on any ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne object; and non-nationals who, on its territory, ships or aircraft, or on board any floating or airborne object under its jurisdiction have committed any of such acts. The Agreement implements the said Radio Regulations, annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, which prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories. The Regulations define broadcasting stations as those in the “broadcasting service”, which is itself defined as a radio-communication service of transmissions to be received directly by the general public, including transmissions of sounds or transmissions by television, facsimile or other means. The term “other means” is broad enough to cover the Internet and other cyber-facilitated means of broadcasting.\nWith regard to the right of visit in the high seas, Article 110 of UNCLOS authorizes warships or other duly authorized vessels or aircraft to board a foreign vessel encountered on the high seas which is not a foreign warship or vessel owned or operated by a foreign State and used only on government non-commercial service when there is a “reasonable ground for suspecting” it is engaged in piracy, slave trading or unauthorized broadcasting, appears to be without nationality, or is of the nationality of the visiting vessel but appears to be disguising its nationality. However, the International Group of Experts writing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were split as to\n2.1 Jurisdiction\nwhether the right of visit includes the right of “virtual visit”, for example, by using cyber means to verify the nationality of the vessel concerned by monitoring its communications, and inspect its cyber infrastructure remotely when suspicion remains that the vessel is engaged in any of the aforesaid proscribed activities.²⁹ This present author submits that it does so include.\nIn a near future, global Internet access from satellites, akin to rebuilding the Internet in space, may become a real possibility.³⁰ The draftsmen of the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime considered it unnecessary to establish jurisdiction over offences involving satellites registered in the name of a State, because unlawful communications by satellites originated from and/or was received on earth, and the satellites were mere mediums of transmission.³¹ This perception may need to be reconsidered in light of the report that nation-State hackers have, since 2007, used a Digital Video Broadband satellite provider covering the Middle East and Africa to hide the actual location and activities of advanced persistent threat (APT) from the “Turla” malware attack. Latching onto unencrypted connections between active IP addresses and satellites to route the traffic to an unused port disguised as the legitimate IP of the user makes the APTs almost impossible to shut down because the cyber infrastructure hosting the cyberattack is not traceable. Although satellite communications usually provide slow and frequently unstable speeds, this cyberattack method is relatively inexpensive to implement, at the cost of initial investment of less than US$1000 and regular maintenance of less than US$1000 per year.³² Google, an important Internet Service Provider (ISP), has “Project Loon” which launches balloons into the stratospheres, at least 20 km (12 miles) above the earth surface, to beam Internet access to users beneath the balloons’ path.³³ Internet connectivity on board an aircraft is now made possible via an antenna on the aircraft’s fuselage which exchanges signals to and from the ground through the nearest satellite in a chain of geostationary satellites situated around the equator approximately 36,000 km above the earth.³⁴ Space law, thus, becomes relevant to the use of cyberspace.\nArticle VIII of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial\n²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, chap. 8 Law of the sea.\n³⁰ “SpaceX chief Musk eyes Internet satellites: report,” China Post, 12 Nov. 2014, 6; Melody Peterson, “Google may invest in SpaceX to back Elon Musk’s satellite project,” Los Angeles Times, 19 Jan. 2015; “SpaceX aims to launch internet from space”, BBC, 17 Nov. 2016.\n³¹ Explanatory Report of 8 Nov. 2001 to the convention adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, para. 234, cited in Spang-Hanssen, Public International Computer Network Law Issues, 318.\n³² Dan Worth, “Turla APT malware threat uses satellites to avoid detection,” Security, 9 Sept. 2015, reporting on the finding of Kaspersky Lab.

Of course, this is subject to other permissible bases of jurisdiction exercisable by other States as explained above. Article III of the Treaty stipulates that space activities are to be carried out “in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding”. They must also be for peaceful purposes,³⁶ but this does not preclude the right to exercise self-defence in outer space or by employing space-based assets to defend against armed attacks launched from outer space against targets on earth.³⁷\n## 2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nActors in cyberspace are States, individuals, other non-State actors, and their proxies.³⁸ There are problems in attributing a cyber activity to any specific person or entity, especially in light of the anonymity of the author of that activity whose identification depends on the ability of the interested party to verify, or back trace, that author.\nSuch anonymity may be achieved in several ways. Virtual private networking (VPN) tunnels the entire network traffic which is encrypted between the start (“client”) and the endpoint (“server”) located elsewhere before data is transmitted to the resource that the user is actually trying to access. Another method is using proxy servers which allow users to hide their IP address by tunnelling all specific types of traffic through another server, and the accessed host need not be a web server. Yet another method is the use of anonymous networks with the “onion routing” technique, utilizing multiple public or private proxy servers to relay encrypted data across many randomly chosen nodes on the anonymity network with multiple layers of encryption applied to the transmitted data, and each relay node decrypting the following layer until the original data is revealed and sent to the intended recipient. Another method involves infecting the computer of another person with malware so that the person planting the malware can control that computer in order to undertake\n³⁵ United Kingdom Treaty Ser.

Finally, users may conceal their personal information or identities to remain anonymous online.³⁹\nIt may be possible to validate the origin of data and verify the sender’s digital signature through a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) which validates a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication, but this is not popularly used.⁴⁰\nFor the purpose of attribution in cyberspace, one must identify the originating source of communication by going over the route by which the communication has come, the person/entity behind it, and whether that person/entity is directed or controlled by another person/entity or a State.\nBack-tracing or back-tracking is the most common method to identify the afore-said point of departure. This includes locating the IP address or addresses, determining the point of contact, and luring the hacker into revealing more details about his/its identity. The more proficient the hacker is, the less successful the back-tracing becomes.⁴¹ However, some types of data that can be collected are relatively difficult to hide and the patterns of how a person browses and clicks through a website may lead to his/its identity.⁴²\nEven where a cyberattack has no international connection, law enforcement authorities not infrequently run into difficulties in apprehending the right perpetrator. In Japan, for example, in 2012 a hacker named Yusuke Katayama (a.k.a. Demon Killer) infected computers belonging to strangers with a Trojan Horse virus and then sent death threats from these computers. Several persons who owned the computers remotely controlled by Katayama were wrongly arrested and subsequently exonerated. Only after Katayama had made an error by sending a riddle containing information that could only have been known by the real perpetrator of the death threats were the police able to identify and arrest him. The police were told by a message to look for a cat at a specific location. The cat was wearing a collar on which was a memory card with details of the code and malicious programme Katayama had used to gain remote control of his victims’ computers. The cat was seen with Katayama on CCTV footage, leading to his arrest in February 2013.⁴³\nThe hackers of the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system in November and December 2014 did not connect directly to Sony’s network, but attacked it by connecting through one or more relay computers at different locations (or using the “stepping stone” systems) in order to hide their actual location. The first evidence of the hack was reported to have been traced to a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, and then New York, Poland, Italy, Bolivia, Singapore, and Cyprus.

The hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace (GoP) made threats against cinemas intending to show the film *The Interview*, a comedy produced by Sony about the assassination of North Korea’s Head of State, and their audiences. On 1 December 2014, the FBI issued a five-page confidential warning to US businesses in general that cyber hackers had used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US, making it impossible to recover any lost data. It gave some technical details about the malware and the advice on how to deal with such an attack.⁴⁵\nSubsequently, the FBI attributed the Sony hack to North Korea on the grounds that: (a) the malware used in the hack had “clear links” to malware developed by North Korea which had been used in a cyberattack in March 2014 against South Korean banks and media outlets, and had been traced to an IP address in Pyongyang, North Korea; (b) the tools used in the said Sony attack had “similarities” to the ones developed by North Korea in specific lines of computer code, encryption algorithms, and data deletion methods; and (c) the statements and threats in connection with the Sony attacks were similar in terms of behaviour to other known attacks by the North Koreans.⁴⁶ The North Korean Government itself initially refused to deny that it was behind the Sony hack,⁴⁷ but subsequently denied it outright and challenged the US to provide evidence to substantiate any allegation that North Korea was the culprit.⁴⁸\nThe FBI’s attribution was not free from criticisms. Skeptics contended that the FBI was very careful not to allege that the attack was controlled from within North Korea. It was also doubted whether a nation State like North Korea could have acted alone without assistance from outside. The FBI insisted that it had “undisclosed intelligence” to confirm the attribution of the Sony attack to North Korea, but doubts about the veracity of such intelligence were raised, drawing a comparison between it and the undisclosed – and subsequently proven to be false – intelligence on\n⁴⁴ “Sony hack puts spotlight on Pyongyang ISP,” *Bangkok Post*, 20 Dec. 2014; Lev Grossman, “What Sony’s Hackers Know”, *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 20.\n⁴⁵ “FBI warns firms of destructive malware use by hackers,” BBC, 2 Dec. 2014.\n⁴⁶ “Obama vows response to ‘N Korea cyber attack’”, *Al Jazeera*, 19 Dec. 2014; “Sony hack: Obama vows response as FBI blames North Korea,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; “FBI director gives new clues tying North Korea to Sony hack,” *Associated Press*, 7 Jan. 2015; Alex Altman and Sam Frizell, “Hollywood Hacked: Why no company is immune,” *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 19.\n⁴⁷ “North Korea refuses to deny Sony Pictures cyber-attack”, *BBC*, 1 Dec. 2014. When asked about its possible involvement in the hack, a spokesman at North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the UN in New York replied: “The hostile forces are relating everything to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I kindly advise you to just wait and see.”\n⁴⁸ Madison Park and Dana Ford, “North Korea to U.S.: Show evidence we hacked Sony,” *CNN*, 14 Jan. 2015, reporting on the press briefing on 13 Jan. 2015 by North Korea’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, New York.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nSaddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction”.⁴⁹ Adding to the confusion was a claim by the group named Lizard Squad which had repeatedly hacked Sony’s network in 2014. An alleged member of the Lizard Squad gave an interview claiming that the group had shared some login data stolen from Sony’s employees with the Guardians of Peace, thereby throwing some doubt on the theory that the North Korean Government was behind the Sony hack at all. There was also a possibility that the hack could have been contracted out by the North Korean Government to private hackers.⁵⁰\nOne of the lessons from this Sony hack episode, according to two experts on cybersecurity, is that attribution of cyberattacks is hard, “mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion”, not the court of law.⁵¹ The same could be said of: (a) the conclusion in 2013 by US cybersecurity firm Mandiant that the Chinese Government was behind one of the world’s prolific group of computer hackers since these hackers could be traced to a location near Shanghai in China which is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a signals intelligence division of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA); and (b) the report in September 2015 by ThreatConnect and Defense Group Inc.⁵² The latter based its attribution of the spyware and “phishing” attacks studied to a hacker collectively known as “Nikon” at a military intelligence unit of the PLA in Kunming, southern China. A member of the Chinese military was identified as the operator of a domain called “GreenSky27” from which the spyware and attacks originated, based on his profile, online activities, and academic publications.\nIndeed, no one has ever come up with conclusive, as opposed to circumstantial evidence, as to who hacked the White House in October 2014, JPMorgan, Nasdaq, and so forth. The 20 March 2013 cyberattack, known as “Dark Seoul”, paralyzed approximately 48,000 computers at several major banks and broadcasters in South Korea, disrupting network systems and deleting files in their hard disks. The cyber hack occurred not long after, owing to the growing tensions between the two Koreas, the North Korean Government had announced it would terminate the armistice agreement which had ended the Korean War in July 1953. On 23 December 2014, computers at South Korea’s nuclear operator were breached, with the hackers trying to steal data, including plant blueprints and personnel information, therefrom. South Korean investigators were reported to have said that they had proof that the hacking\n⁴⁹ Dave Lee, “What is FBI evidence for North Korea hack attack?,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; Brian Todd and Ben Brumfield, “Experts doubt North Korea was behind the Sony hack”, CNN, 27 Dec. 2014.

According to the newspaper, it was the evidence gathered by the malware planted by the NSA to track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by North Korea’s hackers that convinced the US authorities that North Korea had been behind the Sony hack.⁵⁴\nSince 19 October 2015, Facebook notifies its users whenever it believes that their accounts have been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working for a nation State, so that the users can take security measures to secure their online accounts. This is when the attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others and when detailed analyses by Facebook’s own technical experts, taking into account victims’ reports, show strong indication of the involvement of States or State-sponsored entities or persons. Facebook thus follows Google which has taken a similar step since mid-2012.⁵⁵ Microsoft has taken the same measure since 30 December 2015.⁵⁶\n## 2.2.1 ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility\nGuidance on attribution for the purpose of international law of State responsibility is to be sought from the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (2001), which has been relied extensively by the International Court of Justice to interpret international law in this matter.⁵⁷ The Tallinn Manual also follows the ILC’s Draft Articles very closely when it posits: “[u]nder international law, States may be responsible for\n⁵³ K.J.

The actions of non-State actors may also sometimes be attributable to States.”58\nChapter II of the ILC’s Draft Articles, entitled “Attribution of conduct to a State”, explains the rules as follows.\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails that State’s international responsibility.59 The State is treated as a unity, consistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. Therefore, the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. In this connection, a State organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.60 The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority is considered an act attributed to the State under international law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.61 If an organ is placed at the disposal of a State by another State, the conduct of such organ is considered an act of the former State under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the State at whose disposal it is placed.62 The conduct of such an organ of a State or a person or entity is considered an act attributed to the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.63\nBesides, the conduct of a person or group of persons is considered an act attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of that State in carrying out the conduct.64 A general situation of dependence on or support from a State is insufficient for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of the person or group of persons to the State – the State must be able to assert “effective control” over the\n58 Tallinn Manual, 15. See also Rule 6 (Legal responsibility of States) of the Tallinn Manual at 29–34.\nRule 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States” (ibid., 26). However, there is no consensus as to whether this Rule also applies if the State has only constructive (“should have known”) knowledge or whether this Rule applies to States through which cyber operations are routed (ibid., p. 28). See also ibid., 34–36.\n59 Art. 1 Responsibility of a State for its internationally wrongful acts.\n60 Art. 4 Conduct of organs of a State.\n61 Art. 5 Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of government authority.\n62 Art. 6 Conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State.\n63 Art. 7 Excess of authority or contravention of instructions.\n64 Art. 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State.\n2 Jurisdiction and Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace\nconduct in question in the sense of the State’s actual participation of and directions given to the conduct.⁶⁵ The International Court of Justice has affirmed that:\nState’s responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons — neither State organs nor to be equated with such organs — only if, assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful, they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in Article 8 [of the ILC’s Draft Articles mentioned above]. This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed...⁶⁶\nThis means the “effective control” must be exercised, or that the State’s instructions are given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.⁶⁷ The ICJ rejects the “overall control” test as “stretch[ing] too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”.⁶⁸\nThe US position regarding “proxy actors” in cyberspace is in line with the test just mentioned. According to the US,\nStates are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors”, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it. ...⁶⁹\nThe ILC’s Draft Articles also cover exceptional cases, such as during revolution, armed conflict or foreign occupation, where the regular authorities dissolve, are disintegrating, have been suppressed or are for the time being inoperative, as well as cases where lawful authority is being gradually restored, e.g., after foreign occupation. In these circumstances, the conduct of a person or group of persons is\n⁶⁵ Para. (4), ILC Commentary to Art. 8 and para.

USA), ICJ Rep. 1986, paras. 65, 109, 115.\n⁶⁶ Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

However, where the movement achieves its aims and either installs itself as the new Government of the State or forms a new State in part of the territory of the pre-existing State or in a territory under its administration, its conduct is considered to be attributable to that State under international law, and the predecessor State will not be responsible for that conduct except in exceptional cases where the predecessor State was in a position to adopt measures of vigilance, prevention or punishment in respect of the movement’s conduct but improperly failed to do so and this has resulted in an injury or damage to another State.72\nWhere a State acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own, that conduct is considered an act of that State under international to the extent acknowledged and adopted as such by the State.73\nFinally, State A is internationally responsible for aiding or assisting State B in the commission of an international wrongful act by State B if State A does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and if the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by State A itself.74 This requires a close connection between the act of aiding or assisting and the eventual wrongful act of State B. The support must have a substantial effect in the sense of making it materially easier to commit the wrongful act which State A is obligated not to commit itself.75\nIn addition to responsibility for cyber activities attributed to a State, general international law imposes on every State the due diligence duty “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This rule has been laid down by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.76 The territorial State must exercise its due diligence duty as it can be reasonably expected to do so. Thus, a transit State where the Internet is routed through its territory or a developing State from where a cyber activity is launched can only be expected to take any action\n70 Art. 9 Conduct carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities.\n71 Para. 3 of the Commentary to Draft Art. 9, citing the ruling of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in Kenneth P.

In case of State responsibility, however, the accuser must prove that an unlawful cyber activity is “attributable” or “attributed” to a State using the applicable international legal standard explained in Sect. 2.2.1.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s Rule 7 (Cyber operations launched from governmental infrastructure) reads: “The mere fact that a cyber operation has been launched or otherwise originates from governmental cyber infrastructure is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State but is an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation”. Its Rule 8 (Cyber operations routed through a State) provides: “The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State.” The rules are sound, bearing in mind that the origin of the massive cyberattack on Estonia, of which Tallinn is its capital city, in April and May 2007 was traced back to 177 other States around the world!⁷⁹\n“Clear and compelling” information or evidence was cited by the US and NATO in support of their conclusion that Al-Qaeda was behind the 11 September 2001\n⁷⁷ Michael N.

USA)* uses the terms “direct evidence”, which is not merely “suggestive”, and “conclusive” evidence. It is the State making the assertion which bears the burden of proof.⁸² In other cases, the ICJ refers to the need for “conclusive evidence”,⁸³ “a degree of certainty”,⁸⁴ “inferences of fact …[which] leave no room for reasonable doubt”,⁸⁵ “degree of certainty … supported by convincing evidence”,⁸⁶ “clear evidence”,⁸⁷ “[relevant facts] convincingly established by the evidence”,⁸⁸ “evidence [that is] weighty and convincing”,⁸⁹ and “evidence that is fully conclusive”.⁹⁰\nOne veteran cyber threat analyst suggests some set of rules of thumb to prove attribution. Firstly, identify the architects of the malware by looking at a particular, identifying style of the malware. Secondly, consider the timing of the attack which may show the context in which the attack occurs. Thirdly, look at the victims to find out who would benefit from the attack. The analyst concludes, however, that in the end it comes down to a matter of speculation.⁹¹ Even when low-level, unsophisticated hacking against a group of persons opposed to the terrorist group operating under the name of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was discovered, it could not be confirmed that the hacking came from ISIL.⁹² Ironically, North Korea’s Internet was suddenly shut down for 9 h and 31 min on 22–23 December 2014 with no one claiming responsibility at that time, and it could not be proven then whether this was a counterattack by the US Government or by hacktivist groups like Anonymous which had targeted North\n⁸⁰ Letter dated 7 Oct. 2001 from the Permanent Rep. of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N.

States are, thus, expected to act as reasonable States objectively would in same or similar circumstances, taking into due consideration such cumulative factors as the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the evidence when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.⁹⁵\nOne learned author argues that the test of proving attribution for the purpose of State responsibility as explained above is out of touch with cyber reality. According to this view, “attribution asymmetry” in cyberspace makes it more difficult for the victim State to trace cyberattacks from non-State actors who are assisted by a State, while making it easier for the State behind the cyberattacks to control such attacks. This, arguably, provides an incentive for the victim State to resort to using non-State actors to counterattack the State it suspects to be behind an initial attack. A test focusing on “virtual control” is proposed instead, with the burden shifting to a State to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyberattack when that State funds and equips a non-State actor who subsequently launch a cyberattack – this is because the funding/equipping State has greater access to the relevant information concerning possible attribution of responsibility than the victim State does.⁹⁶ It would also establish a rebuttable presumption that when State infrastructure is used for a cyberattack, the State owning the infrastructure is responsible. The new test would also help ensure that the State exercise due diligence not to allow its territory, infrastructure, equipment, or funding to be used for a cyberattack against another State – and if it fails to be duly diligent this would entail State responsibility. The new test would draw upon the ICJ’s reasoning in Nicaragua v. USA where the ICJ noted that the contras continued to fight in Nicaragua even after the US Government had ended its funding to the group on 1 October 1984; hence, a rebuttable presumption that, subject to evidence to the contrary, the US was no longer in control of the contras.⁹⁷ Disassociation from non-State actors suspected of launching a cyberattack\n⁹³ Jo Biddle, “N.

In the meantime, all the factors cited in support of the proposed new test can be taken into consideration in determining whether a cyber activity is attributable to a State pursuant to the existing international law of State responsibility.\nPresently, we may sometimes see the different positions/standards on attribution adopted by intelligence agencies, on the one hand, and law enforcement agencies, on the other hand. The former assess information and evidence, including circumstantial evidence and undisclosed human intelligence, to substantiate their suspicion that an entity or person is behind a cyberattack. The latter usually needs evidence that can stand up in courts of law before they can conclude who is the perpetrator of a cyberattack. This should explain the position taken by the US intelligence agencies and the initial one taken by the FBI, a US national law enforcement agency, in the aftermath of the allegations that a foreign State was behind cyber activities to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016.⁹⁹\nIn international relations, it is diplomatically wise and legally permissible to respond to an offensive act by another State commensurate with the level of certainty that the other State is behind the act: the more certain the evidence is, the more severe the response can be, provided that the response does not exceed the permissible bounds of international law. This will be explained in Sect. 4.7 below.\n## 2.2.3 Attribution and International Organizations, Such As NATO\nIn 2011, the ILC finished its work on the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (DARIOs),¹⁰⁰ which closely follow the ILC’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n⁹⁸ Libicki, Crisis, 22–23.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, for example, is an organization where “the fundamental internal rule governing the functioning of the organization – that of consensus decision-making – is to be found neither in the treaties establishing NATO nor in any formal rules and is, rather, the result of the practice of the organization”.¹⁰¹\nIn Behrami and Saramati, the European Court of Human Rights rules that as the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) led by NATO acted on the authorization of the UN Security Council, the acts complained against UNMIK and KFOR were attributable to the United Nations.¹⁰² However, the Grand Chamber of the same Court rules in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom that the UN Security Council “had neither effective control nor ultimate authority and control over the acts and omissions of foreign troops within the Multi-National Force [in Iraq] and that the applicant’s detention was not, therefore, attributable to the United Nations”; hence, the detention complained of in that case had to be attributed to the State detaining the complainant.¹⁰³\nAttributing to an international organization ultra vires acts taken by its organ takes is supported by international jurisprudence and practice of international organizations as well as policy considerations that “denying attribution of conduct may deprive third parties of all redresses, unless conduct could be attributable to a State or another organization”.¹⁰⁴ Draft Article 9 of DARIOs also makes it clear that conduct which is not otherwise attributable to an international organization shall nevertheless be considered an act of that organization under international law if and to the extent that the organization acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\nthe 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 26 Oct. 2011 (Doc.

Such jurisdiction is based on territoriality, passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace that spans the land, sea, air and outer space domains. In order to hold a State responsible for a cyber activity, that activity must be attributed to the State in accordance with international rules on attribution for the purpose of responsibility, including the applicable standard of proof. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the controversy surrounding alleged foreign interference by cyber means in the 2016 US Presidential election show the difficult challenges for the application of these rules. International organizations can be held accountable for cyber activities attributable to them, too.\nKeywords Jurisdiction in cyberspace • Attribution in cyberspace • State responsibility for cyber activities • 2014 Sony Pictures hacks and international law • Attribution for the 2016 US Presidential election hacks\n## 2.1 Jurisdiction\nWhile no State may claim sovereignty over cyberspace as such, States may exercise sovereign prerogatives over any cyber infrastructure situated on their territory as well as activities associated with that cyber infrastructure.

Jurisdiction to prescribe is the State's authority to legislate or prescribe law and regulations. Jurisdiction to enforce is the State's authority to enforce the law and regulations legislated or prescribed by it. There is also an adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts of the State to interpret its law and regulations.\nJurisdiction is primarily territorial. A State may exercise jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure and over the intangible based on territoriality, including “subjective territorial jurisdiction” over an incident originating in a State’s territory but consummated elsewhere, and “objective territorial jurisdiction” over individuals where an incident has effects on the State’s territory although the act was initiated elsewhere. This territorial jurisdiction extends to the airspace superjacent to the land territory and territorial waters under the State’s sovereignty. For example, a State has jurisdiction over civilian aircraft with airborne cyber infrastructure to hack into Wi-Fi networks or eavesdrop on cell phone calls and text messages and to exfiltrate or otherwise interfere with data in the State’s territory being overflown and may order the aircraft to land to submit to the jurisdiction of the territorial State for violation of its law. In case of State aircraft, they must get prior authorization from the territorial State over which they intend to overfly, and the authorization may comprise conditions, violation of which entitles the territorial State to demand that the aircraft in question cease the violation and depart its airspace without delay, and, if the aircraft refuses, to take necessary and proportional measures against that aircraft.\npersons coordinated by Prof. M. N. Schmitt, Chairman of the International Law Department at the United States Naval War College, at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The second part of the Tallinn Manual entitled Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017) was written by another group of experts including the present author of this book in 2015–2016 and will be hereinafter referred to as Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n“Cyber infrastructure” is defined as “the communication, storage, and computing resources upon which information systems operate” (Tallinn Manual, 15).\n Marko Milanovic, *Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 23–25.

Several States have also asserted jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender’s victim is a national of that State – this is based on the passive personality principle of jurisdiction. Three judges of the ICJ noted in February 2002 that passive personality jurisdiction, which was previously regarded as controversial, is now reflected in the legislation of various States including the US and France “and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so far as a particular category of offences is concerned”. The more serious the offences, the less likely that opposition to the exercise of passive personality jurisdiction will face. Passive personality jurisdiction is an option in, for example, the 1970 Hague Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 1985 Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture; the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance; the 1997 Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; the 1999 Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; the 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the 2006 Enforced Disappearance Convention; and the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism.\nA State may, based on the protective principle, exercise jurisdiction over the offender whose conduct abroad threatens that State’s security or interferes with the operation of its government functions.\nThe most controversial base of jurisdiction is universal jurisdiction, whereby a State asserts jurisdiction over a crime which has no connection (nexus) with that State at all. In other words, the crime is committed outside its territory, does not have any effect therein, and neither the perpetrator nor the victim is its national. It has long been accepted that every State may exercise universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of piracy. Apart from that, it is still controversial whether a State may exercise universal jurisdiction absent treaty obligations binding on the States concerned – as in the case of the obligation to prosecute or extradite commonly found\nSee further, Henrik Spang-Hanssen, Cyberspace &amp; International Law on Jurisdiction (Copenhagen: DJØF Publishing, 2004), chaps. 31, 32; Tallinn Manual, 18.\nPara. 47 of the Joint Separate Opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal, Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Dem.

DPP [1946] AC 34.\n\nin many multilateral conventions on suppression of serious crimes of international concern like international terrorism.\nWith regard to the jurisdiction to enforce, as early as 1928, the Permanent Court of Arbitration enunciated the principle that a State “cannot take measures on the territory of another state by way of enforcement of national laws without the consent of the latter”. This principle was also affirmed by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Lotus case, adding that: “In these circumstances, all that can be required of a State is that it should not overstep the limits which international law places upon its jurisdiction; within these limits, its title to exercise jurisdiction rests in its sovereignty”.\nTherefore, a State may not enforce its criminal law, that is, investigate crimes or arrest suspects, in the territory of another State without that other State’s consent. In this regard, it should be noted that the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (or the Budapest Convention), which is the only multilateral agreement in force on cybercrime, utilizes territorial jurisdiction and jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender as the bases for exercise of jurisdiction over cyber criminal offences.\nAccording to a study by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in general, “forms of territoriality-based and nationality-based jurisdiction are almost always able to ensure a sufficient connection between cybercrime acts and at least one State”. The territoriality-based jurisdiction “can be made with reference to elements or effects of [a cybercrime], or the location of computer systems or data utilized for the offence”.\nUtilization of cloud services poses new challenges for law enforcement. Cloud computing, or Internet-based computing, delivers information services and information over the Internet, without the need for certain hardware or software at the\n Cf.

The development of the national organization of States during the last few centuries and, as a corollary, the development of international law, have established this principle of the exclusive competence of the State in regard to its own territory in such a way as to make it the point of departure in settling most questions that concern international relations.* (*Island of Palmas Case* (*Netherlands/United States of America*), Award of 4 April 1928, *UNRIAA*, vol.

The extraterritoriality issue takes a new dimension as applied to cloud computing because of the lack of any physically located hardware and a data location may cross national borders and may not be known to users, thus questioning any State’s jurisdiction in the first place. The processing in cloud computing may occur in several States simultaneously. It is submitted that in this type of situation more than one State have concurrent jurisdiction over a crime committed via cloud computing, pursuant to any one of jurisdictional bases mentioned above insofar as it is applicable to the facts in question.\nCurrently, fibre-optic cables buried in the seabed are the main conduits of the Internet since satellites have limited capacity compared to cables and are, thus, much more expensive and their use is confined mainly to broadcasting as well as for Internet usage by communities in very remote regions.\nA State has sovereignty over communication cables lying within its land territory, internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It can adopt laws and regulations to protect submarine cables in its territorial sea, for example. To accommodate the interest of existing submarine cables, the law of the sea as codified in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS) requires an archipelagic State, which is recognized pursuant to UNCLOS, to respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. In addition, an archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them. In the maritime area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea called the “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State is measured, all States generally enjoy the freedom of the laying of submarine cables, with due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS and other rules of international law insofar as they are not incompatible therewith. This freedom is permissible as it is not an exercise of sovereign rights over the natural resources which is reserved exclusively for the coastal State in whose EEZ the laying of submarine cables takes place.\n Nancy J.

All States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the continental shelf of another State. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables. The coastal State may set conditions for cables entering its land territory, internal waters or territorial sea. The coastal State also has jurisdiction over cables constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. When laying submarine cables, States are required to have due regard to cables already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables shall not be prejudiced.\nInternational law is silent as to whether and to what extent such cables are subject to the jurisdiction of the States that own them or whose nationals have laid and operate them. In particular, it is doubtful whether these States may take the measures necessary to protect their cables against malicious interference. Marine cables protection zones are permitted in the territorial sea, by virtue of Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS, but not in maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the case of submarine cables lying beyond the territorial sea, Article 113 of UNCLOS requires every State to criminalize their breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications. The provision predated the age of the Internet. Nevertheless, as fibre-optic cables are used in telecommunication that includes telephonic communications, the cables are covered under this UNCLOS provision. This provision applies also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, but it does not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury. Article 114 of UNCLOS requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable, cause a break in or injury to another cable, they shall bear the cost of the repairs. Article 115 requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.\nBesides UNCLOS, the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, in force since 1 May 1888, regulates interference with telegraph cables outside territorial waters of its Parties. It accords the competent jurisdiction to the court of the State in which the vessel in question is registered (“flag State”) and the State of nationality of the offender, in that order. The Convention makes it a punishable offence to break or injure a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages. This provision does not apply to cases where those who break or injure a cable do so with the lawful object of saving their lives or their ship, after they have taken every necessary precaution to avoid so breaking or injuring the cable. There are merely 41 States Parties to the 1884 Convention, though.\nWith regard to unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, Article 109 of UNCLOS requires all States to cooperate in its suppression. “Unauthorized broadcasting” is defined as “the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls”. This provision predated the era of the Internet, and one may question whether it covers transmission by cyber means. It is hereby submitted that if there is some cyber involvement in transmitting sound radio or television broadcast such as using cyber-facilitated means to stream radio and television via the Internet or to disseminate information, especially through social media platforms such as Twitter, vk.com, Facebook, this definition of broadcasting can be interpreted to cover transmission via the Internet. This present author agrees with the position of the majority of the experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the object and purpose of proscribing unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas are primarily the prevention of interference with broadcasting that is not in compliance with international regulations, such as the regulation of broadcasting frequencies, and produces negative effects on maritime or air communications. The posting of online material, including online propaganda, from the high seas poses no such risks and is not covered by this prohibition -- there is no difference whether online material is posted from a vessel in the high seas or on land. The following provisions on unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas must be understood in this context.\nArticle 109 of UNCLOS provides that any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas may be prosecuted before the court of: (a) the flag State of the ship from which the broadcast is made; (b) the State of registry of the installation from which the broadcast is made; (c) the State of which the person is a national; (d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or (e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference. The State having the said jurisdiction may, in conformity with Article 110 of UNCLOS, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus. Article 110 stipulates that, except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign\nship, other than a warship or a ship owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service, may board it if there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the foreign ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109; the foreign ship is without nationality; or though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship. Article 110 applies mutatis mutandis to military aircraft as well as to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service which encounter the suspected ship.\nUNCLOS is supplemented by other international instruments in this matter. For example, the 1965 European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations Outside National Territories regulates broadcasting stations which are installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other floating or airborne objects and which, outside national territories, transmit broadcasts intended for reception or capable of being received, wholly or in part, within the territory of any Contracting Party, or which cause harmful interference to any radio-communication service operating under the authority of a Contracting Party in accordance with the Radio Regulations. Each Contracting Party undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of the said broadcasting, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, apply the provisions of this Agreement in regard to its nationals who have committed any of the aforesaid offences on its territory, ships, or aircraft, or outside national territories on any ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne object; and non-nationals who, on its territory, ships or aircraft, or on board any floating or airborne object under its jurisdiction have committed any of such acts. The Agreement implements the said Radio Regulations, annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, which prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories. The Regulations define broadcasting stations as those in the “broadcasting service”, which is itself defined as a radio-communication service of transmissions to be received directly by the general public, including transmissions of sounds or transmissions by television, facsimile or other means. The term “other means” is broad enough to cover the Internet and other cyber-facilitated means of broadcasting.\nWith regard to the right of visit in the high seas, Article 110 of UNCLOS authorizes warships or other duly authorized vessels or aircraft to board a foreign vessel encountered on the high seas which is not a foreign warship or vessel owned or operated by a foreign State and used only on government non-commercial service when there is a “reasonable ground for suspecting” it is engaged in piracy, slave trading or unauthorized broadcasting, appears to be without nationality, or is of the nationality of the visiting vessel but appears to be disguising its nationality. However, the International Group of Experts writing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were split as to\n2.1 Jurisdiction\nwhether the right of visit includes the right of “virtual visit”, for example, by using cyber means to verify the nationality of the vessel concerned by monitoring its communications, and inspect its cyber infrastructure remotely when suspicion remains that the vessel is engaged in any of the aforesaid proscribed activities. This present author submits that it does so include.\nIn a near future, global Internet access from satellites, akin to rebuilding the Internet in space, may become a real possibility. The draftsmen of the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime considered it unnecessary to establish jurisdiction over offences involving satellites registered in the name of a State, because unlawful communications by satellites originated from and/or was received on earth, and the satellites were mere mediums of transmission. This perception may need to be reconsidered in light of the report that nation-State hackers have, since 2007, used a Digital Video Broadband satellite provider covering the Middle East and Africa to hide the actual location and activities of advanced persistent threat (APT) from the “Turla” malware attack. Latching onto unencrypted connections between active IP addresses and satellites to route the traffic to an unused port disguised as the legitimate IP of the user makes the APTs almost impossible to shut down because the cyber infrastructure hosting the cyberattack is not traceable. Although satellite communications usually provide slow and frequently unstable speeds, this cyberattack method is relatively inexpensive to implement, at the cost of initial investment of less than US$1000 and regular maintenance of less than US$1000 per year. Google, an important Internet Service Provider (ISP), has “Project Loon” which launches balloons into the stratospheres, at least 20 km (12 miles) above the earth surface, to beam Internet access to users beneath the balloons’ path. Internet connectivity on board an aircraft is now made possible via an antenna on the aircraft’s fuselage which exchanges signals to and from the ground through the nearest satellite in a chain of geostationary satellites situated around the equator approximately 36,000 km above the earth. Space law, thus, becomes relevant to the use of cyberspace.\nArticle VIII of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, chap. 8 Law of the sea.\n “SpaceX chief Musk eyes Internet satellites: report,” China Post, 12 Nov. 2014, 6; Melody Peterson, “Google may invest in SpaceX to back Elon Musk’s satellite project,” Los Angeles Times, 19 Jan. 2015; “SpaceX aims to launch internet from space”, BBC, 17 Nov. 2016.\n Explanatory Report of 8 Nov. 2001 to the convention adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, para. 234, cited in Spang-Hanssen, Public International Computer Network Law Issues, 318.\n Dan Worth, “Turla APT malware threat uses satellites to avoid detection,” Security, 9 Sept. 2015, reporting on the finding of Kaspersky Lab.

Of course, this is subject to other permissible bases of jurisdiction exercisable by other States as explained above. Article III of the Treaty stipulates that space activities are to be carried out “in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding”. They must also be for peaceful purposes, but this does not preclude the right to exercise self-defence in outer space or by employing space-based assets to defend against armed attacks launched from outer space against targets on earth.\n## 2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nActors in cyberspace are States, individuals, other non-State actors, and their proxies. There are problems in attributing a cyber activity to any specific person or entity, especially in light of the anonymity of the author of that activity whose identification depends on the ability of the interested party to verify, or back trace, that author.\nSuch anonymity may be achieved in several ways. Virtual private networking (VPN) tunnels the entire network traffic which is encrypted between the start (“client”) and the endpoint (“server”) located elsewhere before data is transmitted to the resource that the user is actually trying to access. Another method is using proxy servers which allow users to hide their IP address by tunnelling all specific types of traffic through another server, and the accessed host need not be a web server. Yet another method is the use of anonymous networks with the “onion routing” technique, utilizing multiple public or private proxy servers to relay encrypted data across many randomly chosen nodes on the anonymity network with multiple layers of encryption applied to the transmitted data, and each relay node decrypting the following layer until the original data is revealed and sent to the intended recipient. Another method involves infecting the computer of another person with malware so that the person planting the malware can control that computer in order to undertake\n United Kingdom Treaty Ser.

Finally, users may conceal their personal information or identities to remain anonymous online.\nIt may be possible to validate the origin of data and verify the sender’s digital signature through a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) which validates a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication, but this is not popularly used.\nFor the purpose of attribution in cyberspace, one must identify the originating source of communication by going over the route by which the communication has come, the person/entity behind it, and whether that person/entity is directed or controlled by another person/entity or a State.\nBack-tracing or back-tracking is the most common method to identify the afore-said point of departure. This includes locating the IP address or addresses, determining the point of contact, and luring the hacker into revealing more details about his/its identity. The more proficient the hacker is, the less successful the back-tracing becomes. However, some types of data that can be collected are relatively difficult to hide and the patterns of how a person browses and clicks through a website may lead to his/its identity.\nEven where a cyberattack has no international connection, law enforcement authorities not infrequently run into difficulties in apprehending the right perpetrator. In Japan, for example, in 2012 a hacker named Yusuke Katayama (a.k.a. Demon Killer) infected computers belonging to strangers with a Trojan Horse virus and then sent death threats from these computers. Several persons who owned the computers remotely controlled by Katayama were wrongly arrested and subsequently exonerated. Only after Katayama had made an error by sending a riddle containing information that could only have been known by the real perpetrator of the death threats were the police able to identify and arrest him. The police were told by a message to look for a cat at a specific location. The cat was wearing a collar on which was a memory card with details of the code and malicious programme Katayama had used to gain remote control of his victims’ computers. The cat was seen with Katayama on CCTV footage, leading to his arrest in February 2013.\nThe hackers of the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system in November and December 2014 did not connect directly to Sony’s network, but attacked it by connecting through one or more relay computers at different locations (or using the “stepping stone” systems) in order to hide their actual location. The first evidence of the hack was reported to have been traced to a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, and then New York, Poland, Italy, Bolivia, Singapore, and Cyprus.

The attack caused thousands of Sony’s computers inoperable, stole proprietary information and employees’ personal identifiable information and confidential communications. The hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace (GoP) made threats against cinemas intending to show the film *The Interview*, a comedy produced by Sony about the assassination of North Korea’s Head of State, and their audiences. On 1 December 2014, the FBI issued a five-page confidential warning to US businesses in general that cyber hackers had used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US, making it impossible to recover any lost data. It gave some technical details about the malware and the advice on how to deal with such an attack.\nSubsequently, the FBI attributed the Sony hack to North Korea on the grounds that: (a) the malware used in the hack had “clear links” to malware developed by North Korea which had been used in a cyberattack in March 2014 against South Korean banks and media outlets, and had been traced to an IP address in Pyongyang, North Korea; (b) the tools used in the said Sony attack had “similarities” to the ones developed by North Korea in specific lines of computer code, encryption algorithms, and data deletion methods; and (c) the statements and threats in connection with the Sony attacks were similar in terms of behaviour to other known attacks by the North Koreans. The North Korean Government itself initially refused to deny that it was behind the Sony hack, but subsequently denied it outright and challenged the US to provide evidence to substantiate any allegation that North Korea was the culprit.\nThe FBI’s attribution was not free from criticisms. Skeptics contended that the FBI was very careful not to allege that the attack was controlled from within North Korea. It was also doubted whether a nation State like North Korea could have acted alone without assistance from outside. The FBI insisted that it had “undisclosed intelligence” to confirm the attribution of the Sony attack to North Korea, but doubts about the veracity of such intelligence were raised, drawing a comparison between it and the undisclosed – and subsequently proven to be false – intelligence on\n “Sony hack puts spotlight on Pyongyang ISP,” *Bangkok Post*, 20 Dec. 2014; Lev Grossman, “What Sony’s Hackers Know”, *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 20.\n “FBI warns firms of destructive malware use by hackers,” BBC, 2 Dec. 2014.\n “Obama vows response to ‘N Korea cyber attack’”, *Al Jazeera*, 19 Dec. 2014; “Sony hack: Obama vows response as FBI blames North Korea,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; “FBI director gives new clues tying North Korea to Sony hack,” *Associated Press*, 7 Jan. 2015; Alex Altman and Sam Frizell, “Hollywood Hacked: Why no company is immune,” *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 19.\n “North Korea refuses to deny Sony Pictures cyber-attack”, *BBC*, 1 Dec. 2014. When asked about its possible involvement in the hack, a spokesman at North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the UN in New York replied: “The hostile forces are relating everything to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I kindly advise you to just wait and see.”\n Madison Park and Dana Ford, “North Korea to U.S.: Show evidence we hacked Sony,” *CNN*, 14 Jan. 2015, reporting on the press briefing on 13 Jan. 2015 by North Korea’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, New York.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nSaddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction”. Adding to the confusion was a claim by the group named Lizard Squad which had repeatedly hacked Sony’s network in 2014. An alleged member of the Lizard Squad gave an interview claiming that the group had shared some login data stolen from Sony’s employees with the Guardians of Peace, thereby throwing some doubt on the theory that the North Korean Government was behind the Sony hack at all. There was also a possibility that the hack could have been contracted out by the North Korean Government to private hackers.\nOne of the lessons from this Sony hack episode, according to two experts on cybersecurity, is that attribution of cyberattacks is hard, “mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion”, not the court of law. The same could be said of: (a) the conclusion in 2013 by US cybersecurity firm Mandiant that the Chinese Government was behind one of the world’s prolific group of computer hackers since these hackers could be traced to a location near Shanghai in China which is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a signals intelligence division of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA); and (b) the report in September 2015 by ThreatConnect and Defense Group Inc. The latter based its attribution of the spyware and “phishing” attacks studied to a hacker collectively known as “Nikon” at a military intelligence unit of the PLA in Kunming, southern China. A member of the Chinese military was identified as the operator of a domain called “GreenSky27” from which the spyware and attacks originated, based on his profile, online activities, and academic publications.\nIndeed, no one has ever come up with conclusive, as opposed to circumstantial evidence, as to who hacked the White House in October 2014, JPMorgan, Nasdaq, and so forth. The 20 March 2013 cyberattack, known as “Dark Seoul”, paralyzed approximately 48,000 computers at several major banks and broadcasters in South Korea, disrupting network systems and deleting files in their hard disks. The cyber hack occurred not long after, owing to the growing tensions between the two Koreas, the North Korean Government had announced it would terminate the armistice agreement which had ended the Korean War in July 1953. On 23 December 2014, computers at South Korea’s nuclear operator were breached, with the hackers trying to steal data, including plant blueprints and personnel information, therefrom. South Korean investigators were reported to have said that they had proof that the hacking\n Dave Lee, “What is FBI evidence for North Korea hack attack?,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; Brian Todd and Ben Brumfield, “Experts doubt North Korea was behind the Sony hack”, CNN, 27 Dec. 2014. A security expert who was part of the South Korean Government’s investigation into the March 2013 cyberattacks attributed to North Korea was reported to have opined that, unlike the March 2013 attack, the Sony attack in December 2014 could not be linked to IP addresses in North Korea (“Security experts doubt North Korea hacked Sony,” Taiwan News, 4 Dec. 2014, 6).\n “Sony hackers ‘shared’ stolen employee login data,” BBC, 30 Dec. 2014.\n Peter W.

In the case of the Sony hack, The New York Times alleged in January 2015 that in 2010 the NSA had “drilled into the Chinese networks that connect North Korea to the outside world, picked through connections in Malaysia favored by North Korean hackers and penetrated directly into the North with the help of South Korea and other American allies, according to former United States and foreign officials, computer experts later briefed on the operations and a newly disclosed NSA document … [and managed to] place malware that could track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by the North’s hackers”. According to the newspaper, it was the evidence gathered by the malware planted by the NSA to track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by North Korea’s hackers that convinced the US authorities that North Korea had been behind the Sony hack.\nSince 19 October 2015, Facebook notifies its users whenever it believes that their accounts have been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working for a nation State, so that the users can take security measures to secure their online accounts. This is when the attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others and when detailed analyses by Facebook’s own technical experts, taking into account victims’ reports, show strong indication of the involvement of States or State-sponsored entities or persons. Facebook thus follows Google which has taken a similar step since mid-2012. Microsoft has taken the same measure since 30 December 2015.\n## 2.2.1 ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility\nGuidance on attribution for the purpose of international law of State responsibility is to be sought from the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (2001), which has been relied extensively by the International Court of Justice to interpret international law in this matter.

The actions of non-State actors may also sometimes be attributable to States.”58\nChapter II of the ILC’s Draft Articles, entitled “Attribution of conduct to a State”, explains the rules as follows.\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails that State’s international responsibility.59 The State is treated as a unity, consistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. Therefore, the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. In this connection, a State organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.60 The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority is considered an act attributed to the State under international law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.61 If an organ is placed at the disposal of a State by another State, the conduct of such organ is considered an act of the former State under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the State at whose disposal it is placed.62 The conduct of such an organ of a State or a person or entity is considered an act attributed to the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.63\nBesides, the conduct of a person or group of persons is considered an act attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of that State in carrying out the conduct.64 A general situation of dependence on or support from a State is insufficient for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of the person or group of persons to the State – the State must be able to assert “effective control” over the\n\nRule 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States” (ibid., 26). However, there is no consensus as to whether this Rule also applies if the State has only constructive (“should have known”) knowledge or whether this Rule applies to States through which cyber operations are routed (ibid., p. 28). See also ibid., 34–36.\n\nconduct in question in the sense of the State’s actual participation of and directions given to the conduct. The International Court of Justice has affirmed that:\nState’s responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons — neither State organs nor to be equated with such organs — only if, assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful, they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in Article 8 [of the ILC’s Draft Articles mentioned above]. This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed...\nThis means the “effective control” must be exercised, or that the State’s instructions are given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations. The ICJ rejects the “overall control” test as “stretch[ing] too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”.\nThe US position regarding “proxy actors” in cyberspace is in line with the test just mentioned. According to the US,\nStates are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors”, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it. ...\nThe ILC’s Draft Articles also cover exceptional cases, such as during revolution, armed conflict or foreign occupation, where the regular authorities dissolve, are disintegrating, have been suppressed or are for the time being inoperative, as well as cases where lawful authority is being gradually restored, e.g., after foreign occupation. In these circumstances, the conduct of a person or group of persons is\n Para. (4), ILC Commentary to Art. 8 and para. (2), ILC Commentary to Art. 10 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (ILC Yearbook 2001, vol. II, Part Two, 47–48, 50).

USA), ICJ Rep. 1986, paras. 65, 109, 115.\n Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

However, where the movement achieves its aims and either installs itself as the new Government of the State or forms a new State in part of the territory of the pre-existing State or in a territory under its administration, its conduct is considered to be attributable to that State under international law, and the predecessor State will not be responsible for that conduct except in exceptional cases where the predecessor State was in a position to adopt measures of vigilance, prevention or punishment in respect of the movement’s conduct but improperly failed to do so and this has resulted in an injury or damage to another State.72\nWhere a State acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own, that conduct is considered an act of that State under international to the extent acknowledged and adopted as such by the State.73\nFinally, State A is internationally responsible for aiding or assisting State B in the commission of an international wrongful act by State B if State A does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and if the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by State A itself.74 This requires a close connection between the act of aiding or assisting and the eventual wrongful act of State B. The support must have a substantial effect in the sense of making it materially easier to commit the wrongful act which State A is obligated not to commit itself.75\nIn addition to responsibility for cyber activities attributed to a State, general international law imposes on every State the due diligence duty “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This rule has been laid down by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.76 The territorial State must exercise its due diligence duty as it can be reasonably expected to do so. Thus, a transit State where the Internet is routed through its territory or a developing State from where a cyber activity is launched can only be expected to take any action\n\nexpected of it when it becomes aware of the activity and only in accordance with its technological capability.\nAlthough the International Group of Experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual could not agree whether constructive knowledge sufficed to entail the due diligence duty, this present author believes that a State must, according to either its actual or constructive knowledge and in light of its technological capability, take measures as may be reasonably expected of it to prevent or stop its territory from being used by a cyberattacker to injure another State. However, it will take time for State practice to settle on what such reasonable measures actually are.\n## 2.2.2 Standard(s) of Proof\nIn apprehending cyber criminals, law enforcement authorities arrest suspects on the basis of evidence which must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt in a criminal court of law. In case of State responsibility, however, the accuser must prove that an unlawful cyber activity is “attributable” or “attributed” to a State using the applicable international legal standard explained in Sect. 2.2.1.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s Rule 7 (Cyber operations launched from governmental infrastructure) reads: “The mere fact that a cyber operation has been launched or otherwise originates from governmental cyber infrastructure is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State but is an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation”. Its Rule 8 (Cyber operations routed through a State) provides: “The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State.” The rules are sound, bearing in mind that the origin of the massive cyberattack on Estonia, of which Tallinn is its capital city, in April and May 2007 was traced back to 177 other States around the world!\n“Clear and compelling” information or evidence was cited by the US and NATO in support of their conclusion that Al-Qaeda was behind the 11 September 2001\n Michael N.

Venezuela)*, 10 *Reports of International Arbitral Awards* 499 (1903), 509–510, where the Italy-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission accepted the contention that a State was only obligated to accord protection to a foreign interest insofar as permitted by the means at that State’s disposal and according to the circumstances as they might be verified.\n The present author, therefore, concurs with Karine Bannelier-Christakis, “Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?,” *Baltic YBIL* 14 (2014): 23, 28–39.

Schmitt, “Cyber operations and the jus ad bellum revisited,” *Villanova L. Rev.* 56 (2011): 569, 569–570. On “proxy cyberattacks”, see Libicki, *Crisis*, 84–89.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nattacks on US soil. This standard is higher than that of “preponderance of the evidence” (i.e., “more likely than not”) in certain civil and administrative proceedings but lower than that of “beyond a reasonable doubt” in criminal law. The ICJ in *Oil Platform (Islamic Republic of Iran v. USA)* uses the terms “direct evidence”, which is not merely “suggestive”, and “conclusive” evidence. It is the State making the assertion which bears the burden of proof. In other cases, the ICJ refers to the need for “conclusive evidence”, “a degree of certainty”, “inferences of fact …[which] leave no room for reasonable doubt”, “degree of certainty … supported by convincing evidence”, “clear evidence”, “[relevant facts] convincingly established by the evidence”, “evidence [that is] weighty and convincing”, and “evidence that is fully conclusive”.\nOne veteran cyber threat analyst suggests some set of rules of thumb to prove attribution. Firstly, identify the architects of the malware by looking at a particular, identifying style of the malware. Secondly, consider the timing of the attack which may show the context in which the attack occurs. Thirdly, look at the victims to find out who would benefit from the attack. The analyst concludes, however, that in the end it comes down to a matter of speculation. Even when low-level, unsophisticated hacking against a group of persons opposed to the terrorist group operating under the name of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was discovered, it could not be confirmed that the hacking came from ISIL. Ironically, North Korea’s Internet was suddenly shut down for 9 h and 31 min on 22–23 December 2014 with no one claiming responsibility at that time, and it could not be proven then whether this was a counterattack by the US Government or by hacktivist groups like Anonymous which had targeted North\n Letter dated 7 Oct. 2001 from the Permanent Rep. of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N.

Only in July 2015 did the Director of the NSA and Commander of the US Cyber Command disclose to the public that he had advised the US President to retaliate against North Korea for the Sony hack.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that in the context of measures of unilateral self-help, the reality is that States must make unilateral ex ante determinations with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State before responding and that such determinations may be subject to post factum review of the applicable burden of proof. States are, thus, expected to act as reasonable States objectively would in same or similar circumstances, taking into due consideration such cumulative factors as the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the evidence when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.\nOne learned author argues that the test of proving attribution for the purpose of State responsibility as explained above is out of touch with cyber reality. According to this view, “attribution asymmetry” in cyberspace makes it more difficult for the victim State to trace cyberattacks from non-State actors who are assisted by a State, while making it easier for the State behind the cyberattacks to control such attacks. This, arguably, provides an incentive for the victim State to resort to using non-State actors to counterattack the State it suspects to be behind an initial attack. A test focusing on “virtual control” is proposed instead, with the burden shifting to a State to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyberattack when that State funds and equips a non-State actor who subsequently launch a cyberattack – this is because the funding/equipping State has greater access to the relevant information concerning possible attribution of responsibility than the victim State does. It would also establish a rebuttable presumption that when State infrastructure is used for a cyberattack, the State owning the infrastructure is responsible. The new test would also help ensure that the State exercise due diligence not to allow its territory, infrastructure, equipment, or funding to be used for a cyberattack against another State – and if it fails to be duly diligent this would entail State responsibility. The new test would draw upon the ICJ’s reasoning in Nicaragua v. USA where the ICJ noted that the contras continued to fight in Nicaragua even after the US Government had ended its funding to the group on 1 October 1984; hence, a rebuttable presumption that, subject to evidence to the contrary, the US was no longer in control of the contras. Disassociation from non-State actors suspected of launching a cyberattack\n Jo Biddle, “N.

It could take years to see if this proposed new test will be endorsed by State practice in relation to cyberspace. In the meantime, all the factors cited in support of the proposed new test can be taken into consideration in determining whether a cyber activity is attributable to a State pursuant to the existing international law of State responsibility.\nPresently, we may sometimes see the different positions/standards on attribution adopted by intelligence agencies, on the one hand, and law enforcement agencies, on the other hand. The former assess information and evidence, including circumstantial evidence and undisclosed human intelligence, to substantiate their suspicion that an entity or person is behind a cyberattack. The latter usually needs evidence that can stand up in courts of law before they can conclude who is the perpetrator of a cyberattack. This should explain the position taken by the US intelligence agencies and the initial one taken by the FBI, a US national law enforcement agency, in the aftermath of the allegations that a foreign State was behind cyber activities to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016.\nIn international relations, it is diplomatically wise and legally permissible to respond to an offensive act by another State commensurate with the level of certainty that the other State is behind the act: the more certain the evidence is, the more severe the response can be, provided that the response does not exceed the permissible bounds of international law. This will be explained in Sect. 4.7 below.\n## 2.2.3 Attribution and International Organizations, Such As NATO\nIn 2011, the ILC finished its work on the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (DARIOs), which closely follow the ILC’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n Libicki, Crisis, 22–23.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, for example, is an organization where “the fundamental internal rule governing the functioning of the organization – that of consensus decision-making – is to be found neither in the treaties establishing NATO nor in any formal rules and is, rather, the result of the practice of the organization”.\nIn Behrami and Saramati, the European Court of Human Rights rules that as the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) led by NATO acted on the authorization of the UN Security Council, the acts complained against UNMIK and KFOR were attributable to the United Nations. However, the Grand Chamber of the same Court rules in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom that the UN Security Council “had neither effective control nor ultimate authority and control over the acts and omissions of foreign troops within the Multi-National Force [in Iraq] and that the applicant’s detention was not, therefore, attributable to the United Nations”; hence, the detention complained of in that case had to be attributed to the State detaining the complainant.\nAttributing to an international organization ultra vires acts taken by its organ takes is supported by international jurisprudence and practice of international organizations as well as policy considerations that “denying attribution of conduct may deprive third parties of all redresses, unless conduct could be attributable to a State or another organization”. Draft Article 9 of DARIOs also makes it clear that conduct which is not otherwise attributable to an international organization shall nevertheless be considered an act of that organization under international law if and to the extent that the organization acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\nthe 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 26 Oct. 2011 (Doc.

    "## Jurisdiction and Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace": "Abstract While no State may claim sovereignty over cyberspace, States may exercise jurisdiction, which is the authority of the State to regulate conduct of natural persons or legal entities by its own domestic law, over cyber activities insofar as permissible under international law, including jurisdiction to prescribe law and regulations and jurisdiction to enforce them. Such jurisdiction is based on territoriality, passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace that spans the land, sea, air and outer space domains. In order to hold a State responsible for a cyber activity, that activity must be attributed to the State in accordance with international rules on attribution for the purpose of responsibility, including the applicable standard of proof. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the controversy surrounding alleged foreign interference by cyber means in the 2016 US Presidential election show the difficult challenges for the application of these rules. International organizations can be held accountable for cyber activities attributable to them, too.\nKeywords Jurisdiction in cyberspace • Attribution in cyberspace • State responsibility for cyber activities • 2014 Sony Pictures hacks and international law • Attribution for the 2016 US Presidential election hacks",

Jurisdiction to prescribe is the State's authority to legislate or prescribe law and regulations. Jurisdiction to enforce is the State's authority to enforce the law and regulations legislated or prescribed by it. There is also an adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts of the State to interpret its law and regulations.³ Jurisdiction is primarily territorial. A State may exercise jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure and over the intangible based on territoriality, including “subjective territorial jurisdiction” over an incident originating in a State’s territory but consummated elsewhere, and “objective territorial jurisdiction” over individuals where an incident has effects on the State’s territory although the act was initiated elsewhere.⁴ This territorial jurisdiction extends to the airspace superjacent to the land territory and territorial waters under the State’s sovereignty.⁵ For example, a State has jurisdiction over civilian aircraft with airborne cyber infrastructure to hack into Wi-Fi networks or eavesdrop on cell phone calls and text messages and to exfiltrate or otherwise interfere with data in the State’s territory being overflown and may order the aircraft to land to submit to the jurisdiction of the territorial State for violation of its law.⁶ In case of State aircraft, they must get prior authorization from the territorial State over which they intend to overfly, and the authorization may comprise conditions,⁷ violation of which entitles the territorial State to demand that the aircraft in question cease the violation and depart its airspace without delay, and, if the aircraft refuses, to take necessary and proportional measures against that aircraft.⁸ persons coordinated by Prof. M. N. Schmitt, Chairman of the International Law Department at the United States Naval War College, at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The second part of the Tallinn Manual entitled Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017) was written by another group of experts including the present author of this book in 2015–2016 and will be hereinafter referred to as Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n“Cyber infrastructure” is defined as “the communication, storage, and computing resources upon which information systems operate” (Tallinn Manual, 15).\n³ Marko Milanovic, *Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 23–25.

Several States have also asserted jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender’s victim is a national of that State – this is based on the passive personality principle of jurisdiction. Three judges of the ICJ noted in February 2002 that passive personality jurisdiction, which was previously regarded as controversial, is now reflected in the legislation of various States including the US and France “and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so far as a particular category of offences is concerned”.¹⁰ The more serious the offences, the less likely that opposition to the exercise of passive personality jurisdiction will face. Passive personality jurisdiction is an option in, for example, the 1970 Hague Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 1985 Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture; the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance; the 1997 Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; the 1999 Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; the 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the 2006 Enforced Disappearance Convention; and the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism.\nA State may, based on the protective principle, exercise jurisdiction over the offender whose conduct abroad threatens that State’s security or interferes with the operation of its government functions.¹¹ The most controversial base of jurisdiction is universal jurisdiction, whereby a State asserts jurisdiction over a crime which has no connection (nexus) with that State at all. In other words, the crime is committed outside its territory, does not have any effect therein, and neither the perpetrator nor the victim is its national. It has long been accepted that every State may exercise universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of piracy. Apart from that, it is still controversial whether a State may exercise universal jurisdiction absent treaty obligations binding on the States concerned – as in the case of the obligation to prosecute or extradite commonly found ⁹See further, Henrik Spang-Hanssen, Cyberspace &amp; International Law on Jurisdiction (Copenhagen: DJØF Publishing, 2004), chaps. 31, 32; Tallinn Manual, 18.\n¹⁰Para. 47 of the Joint Separate Opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal, Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Dem.

DPP [1946] AC 34.\nin many multilateral conventions on suppression of serious crimes of international concern like international terrorism.¹² With regard to the jurisdiction to enforce, as early as 1928, the Permanent Court of Arbitration enunciated the principle that a State “cannot take measures on the territory of another state by way of enforcement of national laws without the consent of the latter”.¹³ This principle was also affirmed by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Lotus case, adding that: “In these circumstances, all that can be required of a State is that it should not overstep the limits which international law places upon its jurisdiction; within these limits, its title to exercise jurisdiction rests in its sovereignty”.¹⁴ Therefore, a State may not enforce its criminal law, that is, investigate crimes or arrest suspects, in the territory of another State without that other State’s consent.¹⁵ In this regard, it should be noted that the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (or the Budapest Convention), which is the only multilateral agreement in force on cybercrime, utilizes territorial jurisdiction and jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender as the bases for exercise of jurisdiction over cyber criminal offences.¹⁶ According to a study by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in general, “forms of territoriality-based and nationality-based jurisdiction are almost always able to ensure a sufficient connection between cybercrime acts and at least one State”.¹⁷ The territoriality-based jurisdiction “can be made with reference to elements or effects of [a cybercrime], or the location of computer systems or data utilized for the offence”.¹⁸ Utilization of cloud services poses new challenges for law enforcement.

The processing in cloud computing may occur in several States simultaneously. It is submitted that in this type of situation more than one State have concurrent jurisdiction over a crime committed via cloud computing, pursuant to any one of jurisdictional bases mentioned above insofar as it is applicable to the facts in question.\nCurrently, fibre-optic cables buried in the seabed are the main conduits of the Internet since satellites have limited capacity compared to cables and are, thus, much more expensive and their use is confined mainly to broadcasting as well as for Internet usage by communities in very remote regions.²¹ A State has sovereignty over communication cables lying within its land territory, internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It can adopt laws and regulations to protect submarine cables in its territorial sea, for example.²² To accommodate the interest of existing submarine cables, the law of the sea as codified in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS) requires an archipelagic State, which is recognized pursuant to UNCLOS, to respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. In addition, an archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them.²³ In the maritime area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea called the “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State is measured, all States generally enjoy the freedom of the laying of submarine cables, with due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS and other rules of international law insofar as they are not incompatible therewith.²⁴ This freedom is permissible as it is not an exercise of sovereign rights over the natural resources which is reserved exclusively for the coastal State in whose EEZ the laying of submarine cables takes place.²⁵ ¹⁹ Nancy J.

All States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the continental shelf of another State. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables. The coastal State may set conditions for cables entering its land territory, internal waters or territorial sea. The coastal State also has jurisdiction over cables constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. When laying submarine cables, States are required to have due regard to cables already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables shall not be prejudiced.\nInternational law is silent as to whether and to what extent such cables are subject to the jurisdiction of the States that own them or whose nationals have laid and operate them. In particular, it is doubtful whether these States may take the measures necessary to protect their cables against malicious interference. Marine cables protection zones are permitted in the territorial sea, by virtue of Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS, but not in maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the case of submarine cables lying beyond the territorial sea, Article 113 of UNCLOS requires every State to criminalize their breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications. The provision predated the age of the Internet. Nevertheless, as fibre-optic cables are used in telecommunication that includes telephonic communications, the cables are covered under this UNCLOS provision. This provision applies also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, but it does not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury. Article 114 of UNCLOS requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable, cause a break in or injury to another cable, they shall bear the cost of the repairs. Article 115 requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.\nBesides UNCLOS, the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, in force since 1 May 1888, regulates interference with telegraph cables outside territorial waters of its Parties. It accords the competent jurisdiction to the court of the State in which the vessel in question is registered (“flag State”) and the State of nationality of the offender, in that order. The Convention makes it a punishable offence to break or injure a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages. This provision does not apply to cases where those who break or injure a cable do so with the lawful object of saving their lives or their ship, after they have taken every necessary precaution to avoid so breaking or injuring the cable. There are merely 41 States Parties to the 1884 Convention, though.\nWith regard to unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, Article 109 of UNCLOS requires all States to cooperate in its suppression. “Unauthorized broadcasting” is defined as “the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls”. This provision predated the era of the Internet, and one may question whether it covers transmission by cyber means. It is hereby submitted that if there is some cyber involvement in transmitting sound radio or television broadcast such as using cyber-facilitated means to stream radio and television via the Internet or to disseminate information, especially through social media platforms such as Twitter, vk.com, Facebook, this definition of broadcasting can be interpreted to cover transmission via the Internet. This present author agrees with the position of the majority of the experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the object and purpose of proscribing unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas are primarily the prevention of interference with broadcasting that is not in compliance with international regulations, such as the regulation of broadcasting frequencies, and produces negative effects on maritime or air communications. The posting of online material, including online propaganda, from the high seas poses no such risks and is not covered by this prohibition -- there is no difference whether online material is posted from a vessel in the high seas or on land. The following provisions on unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas must be understood in this context.\nArticle 109 of UNCLOS provides that any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas may be prosecuted before the court of: (a) the flag State of the ship from which the broadcast is made; (b) the State of registry of the installation from which the broadcast is made; (c) the State of which the person is a national; (d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or (e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference. The State having the said jurisdiction may, in conformity with Article 110 of UNCLOS, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus. Article 110 stipulates that, except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign ship, other than a warship or a ship owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service, may board it if there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the foreign ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109; the foreign ship is without nationality; or though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship. Article 110 applies mutatis mutandis to military aircraft as well as to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service which encounter the suspected ship.\nUNCLOS is supplemented by other international instruments in this matter. For example, the 1965 European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations Outside National Territories regulates broadcasting stations which are installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other floating or airborne objects and which, outside national territories, transmit broadcasts intended for reception or capable of being received, wholly or in part, within the territory of any Contracting Party, or which cause harmful interference to any radio-communication service operating under the authority of a Contracting Party in accordance with the Radio Regulations. Each Contracting Party undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of the said broadcasting, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, apply the provisions of this Agreement in regard to its nationals who have committed any of the aforesaid offences on its territory, ships, or aircraft, or outside national territories on any ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne object; and non-nationals who, on its territory, ships or aircraft, or on board any floating or airborne object under its jurisdiction have committed any of such acts. The Agreement implements the said Radio Regulations, annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, which prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories. The Regulations define broadcasting stations as those in the “broadcasting service”, which is itself defined as a radio-communication service of transmissions to be received directly by the general public, including transmissions of sounds or transmissions by television, facsimile or other means. The term “other means” is broad enough to cover the Internet and other cyber-facilitated means of broadcasting.\nWith regard to the right of visit in the high seas, Article 110 of UNCLOS authorizes warships or other duly authorized vessels or aircraft to board a foreign vessel encountered on the high seas which is not a foreign warship or vessel owned or operated by a foreign State and used only on government non-commercial service when there is a “reasonable ground for suspecting” it is engaged in piracy, slave trading or unauthorized broadcasting, appears to be without nationality, or is of the nationality of the visiting vessel but appears to be disguising its nationality. However, the International Group of Experts writing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were split as to 2.1 Jurisdiction whether the right of visit includes the right of “virtual visit”, for example, by using cyber means to verify the nationality of the vessel concerned by monitoring its communications, and inspect its cyber infrastructure remotely when suspicion remains that the vessel is engaged in any of the aforesaid proscribed activities.²⁹ This present author submits that it does so include.\nIn a near future, global Internet access from satellites, akin to rebuilding the Internet in space, may become a real possibility.³⁰ The draftsmen of the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime considered it unnecessary to establish jurisdiction over offences involving satellites registered in the name of a State, because unlawful communications by satellites originated from and/or was received on earth, and the satellites were mere mediums of transmission.³¹ This perception may need to be reconsidered in light of the report that nation-State hackers have, since 2007, used a Digital Video Broadband satellite provider covering the Middle East and Africa to hide the actual location and activities of advanced persistent threat (APT) from the “Turla” malware attack. Latching onto unencrypted connections between active IP addresses and satellites to route the traffic to an unused port disguised as the legitimate IP of the user makes the APTs almost impossible to shut down because the cyber infrastructure hosting the cyberattack is not traceable. Although satellite communications usually provide slow and frequently unstable speeds, this cyberattack method is relatively inexpensive to implement, at the cost of initial investment of less than US$1000 and regular maintenance of less than US$1000 per year.³² Google, an important Internet Service Provider (ISP), has “Project Loon” which launches balloons into the stratospheres, at least 20 km (12 miles) above the earth surface, to beam Internet access to users beneath the balloons’ path.³³ Internet connectivity on board an aircraft is now made possible via an antenna on the aircraft’s fuselage which exchanges signals to and from the ground through the nearest satellite in a chain of geostationary satellites situated around the equator approximately 36,000 km above the earth.³⁴ Space law, thus, becomes relevant to the use of cyberspace.\nArticle VIII of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial ²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, chap. 8 Law of the sea.\n³⁰ “SpaceX chief Musk eyes Internet satellites: report,” China Post, 12 Nov. 2014, 6; Melody Peterson, “Google may invest in SpaceX to back Elon Musk’s satellite project,” Los Angeles Times, 19 Jan. 2015; “SpaceX aims to launch internet from space”, BBC, 17 Nov. 2016.\n³¹ Explanatory Report of 8 Nov. 2001 to the convention adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, para. 234, cited in Spang-Hanssen, Public International Computer Network Law Issues, 318.\n³² Dan Worth, “Turla APT malware threat uses satellites to avoid detection,” Security, 9 Sept. 2015, reporting on the finding of Kaspersky Lab.

Of course, this is subject to other permissible bases of jurisdiction exercisable by other States as explained above. Article III of the Treaty stipulates that space activities are to be carried out “in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding”. They must also be for peaceful purposes,³⁶ but this does not preclude the right to exercise self-defence in outer space or by employing space-based assets to defend against armed attacks launched from outer space against targets on earth.³⁷ ## 2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility Actors in cyberspace are States, individuals, other non-State actors, and their proxies.³⁸ There are problems in attributing a cyber activity to any specific person or entity, especially in light of the anonymity of the author of that activity whose identification depends on the ability of the interested party to verify, or back trace, that author.\nSuch anonymity may be achieved in several ways. Virtual private networking (VPN) tunnels the entire network traffic which is encrypted between the start (“client”) and the endpoint (“server”) located elsewhere before data is transmitted to the resource that the user is actually trying to access. Another method is using proxy servers which allow users to hide their IP address by tunnelling all specific types of traffic through another server, and the accessed host need not be a web server. Yet another method is the use of anonymous networks with the “onion routing” technique, utilizing multiple public or private proxy servers to relay encrypted data across many randomly chosen nodes on the anonymity network with multiple layers of encryption applied to the transmitted data, and each relay node decrypting the following layer until the original data is revealed and sent to the intended recipient. Another method involves infecting the computer of another person with malware so that the person planting the malware can control that computer in order to undertake ³⁵ United Kingdom Treaty Ser.

Finally, users may conceal their personal information or identities to remain anonymous online.³⁹ It may be possible to validate the origin of data and verify the sender’s digital signature through a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) which validates a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication, but this is not popularly used.⁴⁰ For the purpose of attribution in cyberspace, one must identify the originating source of communication by going over the route by which the communication has come, the person/entity behind it, and whether that person/entity is directed or controlled by another person/entity or a State.\nBack-tracing or back-tracking is the most common method to identify the afore-said point of departure. This includes locating the IP address or addresses, determining the point of contact, and luring the hacker into revealing more details about his/its identity. The more proficient the hacker is, the less successful the back-tracing becomes.⁴¹ However, some types of data that can be collected are relatively difficult to hide and the patterns of how a person browses and clicks through a website may lead to his/its identity.⁴² Even where a cyberattack has no international connection, law enforcement authorities not infrequently run into difficulties in apprehending the right perpetrator. In Japan, for example, in 2012 a hacker named Yusuke Katayama (a.k.a. Demon Killer) infected computers belonging to strangers with a Trojan Horse virus and then sent death threats from these computers. Several persons who owned the computers remotely controlled by Katayama were wrongly arrested and subsequently exonerated. Only after Katayama had made an error by sending a riddle containing information that could only have been known by the real perpetrator of the death threats were the police able to identify and arrest him. The police were told by a message to look for a cat at a specific location. The cat was wearing a collar on which was a memory card with details of the code and malicious programme Katayama had used to gain remote control of his victims’ computers. The cat was seen with Katayama on CCTV footage, leading to his arrest in February 2013.⁴³ The hackers of the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system in November and December 2014 did not connect directly to Sony’s network, but attacked it by connecting through one or more relay computers at different locations (or using the “stepping stone” systems) in order to hide their actual location. The first evidence of the hack was reported to have been traced to a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, and then New York, Poland, Italy, Bolivia, Singapore, and Cyprus.

The hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace (GoP) made threats against cinemas intending to show the film *The Interview*, a comedy produced by Sony about the assassination of North Korea’s Head of State, and their audiences. On 1 December 2014, the FBI issued a five-page confidential warning to US businesses in general that cyber hackers had used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US, making it impossible to recover any lost data. It gave some technical details about the malware and the advice on how to deal with such an attack.⁴⁵ Subsequently, the FBI attributed the Sony hack to North Korea on the grounds that: (a) the malware used in the hack had “clear links” to malware developed by North Korea which had been used in a cyberattack in March 2014 against South Korean banks and media outlets, and had been traced to an IP address in Pyongyang, North Korea; (b) the tools used in the said Sony attack had “similarities” to the ones developed by North Korea in specific lines of computer code, encryption algorithms, and data deletion methods; and (c) the statements and threats in connection with the Sony attacks were similar in terms of behaviour to other known attacks by the North Koreans.⁴⁶ The North Korean Government itself initially refused to deny that it was behind the Sony hack,⁴⁷ but subsequently denied it outright and challenged the US to provide evidence to substantiate any allegation that North Korea was the culprit.⁴⁸ The FBI’s attribution was not free from criticisms. Skeptics contended that the FBI was very careful not to allege that the attack was controlled from within North Korea. It was also doubted whether a nation State like North Korea could have acted alone without assistance from outside. The FBI insisted that it had “undisclosed intelligence” to confirm the attribution of the Sony attack to North Korea, but doubts about the veracity of such intelligence were raised, drawing a comparison between it and the undisclosed – and subsequently proven to be false – intelligence on ⁴⁴ “Sony hack puts spotlight on Pyongyang ISP,” *Bangkok Post*, 20 Dec. 2014; Lev Grossman, “What Sony’s Hackers Know”, *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 20.\n⁴⁵ “FBI warns firms of destructive malware use by hackers,” BBC, 2 Dec. 2014.\n⁴⁶ “Obama vows response to ‘N Korea cyber attack’”, *Al Jazeera*, 19 Dec. 2014; “Sony hack: Obama vows response as FBI blames North Korea,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; “FBI director gives new clues tying North Korea to Sony hack,” *Associated Press*, 7 Jan. 2015; Alex Altman and Sam Frizell, “Hollywood Hacked: Why no company is immune,” *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 19.\n⁴⁷ “North Korea refuses to deny Sony Pictures cyber-attack”, *BBC*, 1 Dec. 2014. When asked about its possible involvement in the hack, a spokesman at North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the UN in New York replied: “The hostile forces are relating everything to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I kindly advise you to just wait and see.”\n⁴⁸ Madison Park and Dana Ford, “North Korea to U.S.: Show evidence we hacked Sony,” *CNN*, 14 Jan. 2015, reporting on the press briefing on 13 Jan. 2015 by North Korea’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, New York.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility Saddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction”.⁴⁹ Adding to the confusion was a claim by the group named Lizard Squad which had repeatedly hacked Sony’s network in 2014. An alleged member of the Lizard Squad gave an interview claiming that the group had shared some login data stolen from Sony’s employees with the Guardians of Peace, thereby throwing some doubt on the theory that the North Korean Government was behind the Sony hack at all. There was also a possibility that the hack could have been contracted out by the North Korean Government to private hackers.⁵⁰ One of the lessons from this Sony hack episode, according to two experts on cybersecurity, is that attribution of cyberattacks is hard, “mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion”, not the court of law.⁵¹ The same could be said of: (a) the conclusion in 2013 by US cybersecurity firm Mandiant that the Chinese Government was behind one of the world’s prolific group of computer hackers since these hackers could be traced to a location near Shanghai in China which is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a signals intelligence division of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA); and (b) the report in September 2015 by ThreatConnect and Defense Group Inc.⁵² The latter based its attribution of the spyware and “phishing” attacks studied to a hacker collectively known as “Nikon” at a military intelligence unit of the PLA in Kunming, southern China. A member of the Chinese military was identified as the operator of a domain called “GreenSky27” from which the spyware and attacks originated, based on his profile, online activities, and academic publications.\nIndeed, no one has ever come up with conclusive, as opposed to circumstantial evidence, as to who hacked the White House in October 2014, JPMorgan, Nasdaq, and so forth. The 20 March 2013 cyberattack, known as “Dark Seoul”, paralyzed approximately 48,000 computers at several major banks and broadcasters in South Korea, disrupting network systems and deleting files in their hard disks. The cyber hack occurred not long after, owing to the growing tensions between the two Koreas, the North Korean Government had announced it would terminate the armistice agreement which had ended the Korean War in July 1953. On 23 December 2014, computers at South Korea’s nuclear operator were breached, with the hackers trying to steal data, including plant blueprints and personnel information, therefrom. South Korean investigators were reported to have said that they had proof that the hacking ⁴⁹ Dave Lee, “What is FBI evidence for North Korea hack attack?,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; Brian Todd and Ben Brumfield, “Experts doubt North Korea was behind the Sony hack”, CNN, 27 Dec. 2014. A security expert who was part of the South Korean Government’s investigation into the March 2013 cyberattacks attributed to North Korea was reported to have opined that, unlike the March 2013 attack, the Sony attack in December 2014 could not be linked to IP addresses in North Korea (“Security experts doubt North Korea hacked Sony,” Taiwan News, 4 Dec. 2014, 6).\n⁵⁰ “Sony hackers ‘shared’ stolen employee login data,” BBC, 30 Dec. 2014.\n⁵¹ Peter W. Singer and Allan Friedman, “5 lessons from the Sony hack,” CNN, 17 Dec. 2014. Both are the authors of Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), which explains the difficulties of attribution at 72–76.\n⁵² Sophia Yan, “Researchers identify Chinese military hacker,” CNN, 24 Sept. 2015.\ncodes in the attacks were linked to North Korea.⁵³ In the case of the Sony hack, The New York Times alleged in January 2015 that in 2010 the NSA had “drilled into the Chinese networks that connect North Korea to the outside world, picked through connections in Malaysia favored by North Korean hackers and penetrated directly into the North with the help of South Korea and other American allies, according to former United States and foreign officials, computer experts later briefed on the operations and a newly disclosed NSA document … [and managed to] place malware that could track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by the North’s hackers”. According to the newspaper, it was the evidence gathered by the malware planted by the NSA to track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by North Korea’s hackers that convinced the US authorities that North Korea had been behind the Sony hack.⁵⁴ Since 19 October 2015, Facebook notifies its users whenever it believes that their accounts have been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working for a nation State, so that the users can take security measures to secure their online accounts. This is when the attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others and when detailed analyses by Facebook’s own technical experts, taking into account victims’ reports, show strong indication of the involvement of States or State-sponsored entities or persons. Facebook thus follows Google which has taken a similar step since mid-2012.⁵⁵ Microsoft has taken the same measure since 30 December 2015.⁵⁶ ## 2.2.1 ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility Guidance on attribution for the purpose of international law of State responsibility is to be sought from the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (2001), which has been relied extensively by the International Court of Justice to interpret international law in this matter.⁵⁷ The Tallinn Manual also follows the ILC’s Draft Articles very closely when it posits: “[u]nder international law, States may be responsible for ⁵³ K.J.

The actions of non-State actors may also sometimes be attributable to States.”58 Chapter II of the ILC’s Draft Articles, entitled “Attribution of conduct to a State”, explains the rules as follows.\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails that State’s international responsibility.59 The State is treated as a unity, consistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. Therefore, the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. In this connection, a State organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.60 The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority is considered an act attributed to the State under international law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.61 If an organ is placed at the disposal of a State by another State, the conduct of such organ is considered an act of the former State under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the State at whose disposal it is placed.62 The conduct of such an organ of a State or a person or entity is considered an act attributed to the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.63 Besides, the conduct of a person or group of persons is considered an act attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of that State in carrying out the conduct.64 A general situation of dependence on or support from a State is insufficient for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of the person or group of persons to the State – the State must be able to assert “effective control” over the Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States” (ibid., 26). However, there is no consensus as to whether this Rule also applies if the State has only constructive (“should have known”) knowledge or whether this Rule applies to States through which cyber operations are routed (ibid., p. 28). See also ibid., 34–36.\nconduct in question in the sense of the State’s actual participation of and directions given to the conduct.⁶⁵ The International Court of Justice has affirmed that: State’s responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons — neither State organs nor to be equated with such organs — only if, assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful, they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in Article 8 [of the ILC’s Draft Articles mentioned above]. This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed...⁶⁶ This means the “effective control” must be exercised, or that the State’s instructions are given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.⁶⁷ The ICJ rejects the “overall control” test as “stretch[ing] too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”.⁶⁸ The US position regarding “proxy actors” in cyberspace is in line with the test just mentioned. According to the US, States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors”, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it....⁶⁹ The ILC’s Draft Articles also cover exceptional cases, such as during revolution, armed conflict or foreign occupation, where the regular authorities dissolve, are disintegrating, have been suppressed or are for the time being inoperative, as well as cases where lawful authority is being gradually restored, e.g., after foreign occupation. In these circumstances, the conduct of a person or group of persons is ⁶⁵ Para. (4), ILC Commentary to Art. 8 and para. (2), ILC Commentary to Art. 10 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (ILC Yearbook 2001, vol. II, Part Two, 47–48, 50). The ILC bases its conclusion on the test established by the ICJ in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA), ICJ Rep. 1986, paras. 65, 109, 115.\n⁶⁶ Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), ICJ Rep. 2007, p. 43, para. 406.\n⁶⁷ Ibid., para. 400.\n⁶⁸ Ibid., para. 406.\n⁶⁹ “International Law in Cyberspace”, remarks by Harold Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser, US Department of State, US CYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, Ft. Meade, MD, 18 Sept. 2012.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact exercising elements of the governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities and in circumstances such as to call for the exercise of those elements of authority.70 The ILC cites as an example the position of the Revolutionary Guards or “Komitehs” immediately after the revolution in the Islamic Republic of Iran who performed immigration, customs and similar functions at Tehran airport in the immediate aftermath of the revolution.71 As a general rule, the conduct of an insurrectional movement cannot be attributed to the State. However, where the movement achieves its aims and either installs itself as the new Government of the State or forms a new State in part of the territory of the pre-existing State or in a territory under its administration, its conduct is considered to be attributable to that State under international law, and the predecessor State will not be responsible for that conduct except in exceptional cases where the predecessor State was in a position to adopt measures of vigilance, prevention or punishment in respect of the movement’s conduct but improperly failed to do so and this has resulted in an injury or damage to another State.72 Where a State acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own, that conduct is considered an act of that State under international to the extent acknowledged and adopted as such by the State.73 Finally, State A is internationally responsible for aiding or assisting State B in the commission of an international wrongful act by State B if State A does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and if the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by State A itself.74 This requires a close connection between the act of aiding or assisting and the eventual wrongful act of State B. The support must have a substantial effect in the sense of making it materially easier to commit the wrongful act which State A is obligated not to commit itself.75 In addition to responsibility for cyber activities attributed to a State, general international law imposes on every State the due diligence duty “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This rule has been laid down by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.76 The territorial State must exercise its due diligence duty as it can be reasonably expected to do so. Thus, a transit State where the Internet is routed through its territory or a developing State from where a cyber activity is launched can only be expected to take any action expected of it when it becomes aware of the activity and only in accordance with its technological capability.⁷⁷ Although the International Group of Experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual could not agree whether constructive knowledge sufficed to entail the due diligence duty, this present author believes that a State must, according to either its actual or constructive knowledge and in light of its technological capability, take measures as may be reasonably expected of it to prevent or stop its territory from being used by a cyberattacker to injure another State.⁷⁸ However, it will take time for State practice to settle on what such reasonable measures actually are.",
    "## 2.2.2 Standard(s) of Proof In apprehending cyber criminals, law enforcement authorities arrest suspects on the basis of evidence which must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt in a criminal court of law. In case of State responsibility, however, the accuser must prove that an unlawful cyber activity is “attributable” or “attributed” to a State using the applicable international legal standard explained in Sect. 2.2.1.": "The Tallinn Manual’s Rule 7 (Cyber operations launched from governmental infrastructure) reads: “The mere fact that a cyber operation has been launched or otherwise originates from governmental cyber infrastructure is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State but is an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation”. Its Rule 8 (Cyber operations routed through a State) provides: “The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State.” The rules are sound, bearing in mind that the origin of the massive cyberattack on Estonia, of which Tallinn is its capital city, in April and May 2007 was traced back to 177 other States around the world!⁷⁹ “Clear and compelling” information or evidence was cited by the US and NATO in support of their conclusion that Al-Qaeda was behind the 11 September 2001 ⁷⁷ Michael N.

USA)* uses the terms “direct evidence”, which is not merely “suggestive”, and “conclusive” evidence. It is the State making the assertion which bears the burden of proof.⁸² In other cases, the ICJ refers to the need for “conclusive evidence”,⁸³ “a degree of certainty”,⁸⁴ “inferences of fact …[which] leave no room for reasonable doubt”,⁸⁵ “degree of certainty … supported by convincing evidence”,⁸⁶ “clear evidence”,⁸⁷ “[relevant facts] convincingly established by the evidence”,⁸⁸ “evidence [that is] weighty and convincing”,⁸⁹ and “evidence that is fully conclusive”.⁹⁰ One veteran cyber threat analyst suggests some set of rules of thumb to prove attribution. Firstly, identify the architects of the malware by looking at a particular, identifying style of the malware. Secondly, consider the timing of the attack which may show the context in which the attack occurs. Thirdly, look at the victims to find out who would benefit from the attack. The analyst concludes, however, that in the end it comes down to a matter of speculation.⁹¹ Even when low-level, unsophisticated hacking against a group of persons opposed to the terrorist group operating under the name of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was discovered, it could not be confirmed that the hacking came from ISIL.⁹² Ironically, North Korea’s Internet was suddenly shut down for 9 h and 31 min on 22–23 December 2014 with no one claiming responsibility at that time, and it could not be proven then whether this was a counterattack by the US Government or by hacktivist groups like Anonymous which had targeted North ⁸⁰ Letter dated 7 Oct. 2001 from the Permanent Rep. of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N.

States are, thus, expected to act as reasonable States objectively would in same or similar circumstances, taking into due consideration such cumulative factors as the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the evidence when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.⁹⁵ One learned author argues that the test of proving attribution for the purpose of State responsibility as explained above is out of touch with cyber reality. According to this view, “attribution asymmetry” in cyberspace makes it more difficult for the victim State to trace cyberattacks from non-State actors who are assisted by a State, while making it easier for the State behind the cyberattacks to control such attacks. This, arguably, provides an incentive for the victim State to resort to using non-State actors to counterattack the State it suspects to be behind an initial attack. A test focusing on “virtual control” is proposed instead, with the burden shifting to a State to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyberattack when that State funds and equips a non-State actor who subsequently launch a cyberattack – this is because the funding/equipping State has greater access to the relevant information concerning possible attribution of responsibility than the victim State does.⁹⁶ It would also establish a rebuttable presumption that when State infrastructure is used for a cyberattack, the State owning the infrastructure is responsible. The new test would also help ensure that the State exercise due diligence not to allow its territory, infrastructure, equipment, or funding to be used for a cyberattack against another State – and if it fails to be duly diligent this would entail State responsibility. The new test would draw upon the ICJ’s reasoning in Nicaragua v. USA where the ICJ noted that the contras continued to fight in Nicaragua even after the US Government had ended its funding to the group on 1 October 1984; hence, a rebuttable presumption that, subject to evidence to the contrary, the US was no longer in control of the contras.⁹⁷ Disassociation from non-State actors suspected of launching a cyberattack ⁹³ Jo Biddle, “N.

Judgment in Tadic (Case No. IT-94-1-A, 15 Jul 1999) that the continuing salary payment by the Rep. of Yugoslavia to an armed group did indicate control of the group by the Rep. of Yugoslavia.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility also shows the good faith on the part of the disassociating State.⁹⁸ It could take years to see if this proposed new test will be endorsed by State practice in relation to cyberspace. In the meantime, all the factors cited in support of the proposed new test can be taken into consideration in determining whether a cyber activity is attributable to a State pursuant to the existing international law of State responsibility.\nPresently, we may sometimes see the different positions/standards on attribution adopted by intelligence agencies, on the one hand, and law enforcement agencies, on the other hand. The former assess information and evidence, including circumstantial evidence and undisclosed human intelligence, to substantiate their suspicion that an entity or person is behind a cyberattack. The latter usually needs evidence that can stand up in courts of law before they can conclude who is the perpetrator of a cyberattack. This should explain the position taken by the US intelligence agencies and the initial one taken by the FBI, a US national law enforcement agency, in the aftermath of the allegations that a foreign State was behind cyber activities to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016.⁹⁹ In international relations, it is diplomatically wise and legally permissible to respond to an offensive act by another State commensurate with the level of certainty that the other State is behind the act: the more certain the evidence is, the more severe the response can be, provided that the response does not exceed the permissible bounds of international law. This will be explained in Sect. 4.7 below.",

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, for example, is an organization where “the fundamental internal rule governing the functioning of the organization – that of consensus decision-making – is to be found neither in the treaties establishing NATO nor in any formal rules and is, rather, the result of the practice of the organization”.¹⁰¹ In Behrami and Saramati, the European Court of Human Rights rules that as the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) led by NATO acted on the authorization of the UN Security Council, the acts complained against UNMIK and KFOR were attributable to the United Nations.¹⁰² However, the Grand Chamber of the same Court rules in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom that the UN Security Council “had neither effective control nor ultimate authority and control over the acts and omissions of foreign troops within the Multi-National Force [in Iraq] and that the applicant’s detention was not, therefore, attributable to the United Nations”; hence, the detention complained of in that case had to be attributed to the State detaining the complainant.¹⁰³ Attributing to an international organization ultra vires acts taken by its organ takes is supported by international jurisprudence and practice of international organizations as well as policy considerations that “denying attribution of conduct may deprive third parties of all redresses, unless conduct could be attributable to a State or another organization”.¹⁰⁴ Draft Article 9 of DARIOs also makes it clear that conduct which is not otherwise attributable to an international organization shall nevertheless be considered an act of that organization under international law if and to the extent that the organization acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\nthe 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 26 Oct. 2011 (Doc.

Such jurisdiction is based on territoriality, passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace that spans the land, sea, air and outer space domains. In order to hold a State responsible for a cyber activity, that activity must be attributed to the State in accordance with international rules on attribution for the purpose of responsibility, including the applicable standard of proof. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the controversy surrounding alleged foreign interference by cyber means in the 2016 US Presidential election show the difficult challenges for the application of these rules. International organizations can be held accountable for cyber activities attributable to them, too.\nKeywords Jurisdiction in cyberspace • Attribution in cyberspace • State responsibility for cyber activities • 2014 Sony Pictures hacks and international law • Attribution for the 2016 US Presidential election hacks\n## 2.1 Jurisdiction\nWhile no State may claim sovereignty over cyberspace as such, States may exercise sovereign prerogatives over any cyber infrastructure situated on their territory as well as activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Such prerogatives\n See, generally, Secretariat of the International Law Commission, *Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of the Fifty-eighth Session* (2006), UN Gen. Ass. Off.

Jurisdiction to prescribe is the State's authority to legislate or prescribe law and regulations. Jurisdiction to enforce is the State's authority to enforce the law and regulations legislated or prescribed by it. There is also an adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts of the State to interpret its law and regulations.\nJurisdiction is primarily territorial. A State may exercise jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure and over the intangible based on territoriality, including “subjective territorial jurisdiction” over an incident originating in a State’s territory but consummated elsewhere, and “objective territorial jurisdiction” over individuals where an incident has effects on the State’s territory although the act was initiated elsewhere. This territorial jurisdiction extends to the airspace superjacent to the land territory and territorial waters under the State’s sovereignty. For example, a State has jurisdiction over civilian aircraft with airborne cyber infrastructure to hack into Wi-Fi networks or eavesdrop on cell phone calls and text messages and to exfiltrate or otherwise interfere with data in the State’s territory being overflown and may order the aircraft to land to submit to the jurisdiction of the territorial State for violation of its law. In case of State aircraft, they must get prior authorization from the territorial State over which they intend to overfly, and the authorization may comprise conditions, violation of which entitles the territorial State to demand that the aircraft in question cease the violation and depart its airspace without delay, and, if the aircraft refuses, to take necessary and proportional measures against that aircraft.\npersons coordinated by Prof. M. N. Schmitt, Chairman of the International Law Department at the United States Naval War College, at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The second part of the Tallinn Manual entitled Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017) was written by another group of experts including the present author of this book in 2015–2016 and will be hereinafter referred to as Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n“Cyber infrastructure” is defined as “the communication, storage, and computing resources upon which information systems operate” (Tallinn Manual, 15).\n Marko Milanovic, *Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 23–25. See also, Uta Kohl, “Jurisdiction in cyberspace,” in *Research Handbook*, eds., Tsagourias and Buchan, 30–54.\n E.g., Art. 27(1) of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter referred to as “UNCLOS”) authorizes the coastal State to exercise criminal jurisdiction over a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea to arrest any person or to conduct any investigation in connection with any crime committed on board the ship during its passage if the consequences of the crime extend to the coastal State.\n Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944, Arts. 1 and 2; UNCLOS, Art. 2(1).\n *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, chap. 9 Air law.\n Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944, Art. 3(c).\n *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, chap. 9 Air law.\n2.1 Jurisdiction\nIn addition, it has become acceptable for a State to exercise jurisdiction based on passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace.\nUnder the active personality principle of jurisdiction, a State may exercise jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender is a national of that State. Several States have also asserted jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender’s victim is a national of that State – this is based on the passive personality principle of jurisdiction. Three judges of the ICJ noted in February 2002 that passive personality jurisdiction, which was previously regarded as controversial, is now reflected in the legislation of various States including the US and France “and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so far as a particular category of offences is concerned”. The more serious the offences, the less likely that opposition to the exercise of passive personality jurisdiction will face. Passive personality jurisdiction is an option in, for example, the 1970 Hague Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 1985 Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture; the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance; the 1997 Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; the 1999 Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; the 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the 2006 Enforced Disappearance Convention; and the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism.\nA State may, based on the protective principle, exercise jurisdiction over the offender whose conduct abroad threatens that State’s security or interferes with the operation of its government functions.\nThe most controversial base of jurisdiction is universal jurisdiction, whereby a State asserts jurisdiction over a crime which has no connection (nexus) with that State at all. In other words, the crime is committed outside its territory, does not have any effect therein, and neither the perpetrator nor the victim is its national. It has long been accepted that every State may exercise universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of piracy. Apart from that, it is still controversial whether a State may exercise universal jurisdiction absent treaty obligations binding on the States concerned – as in the case of the obligation to prosecute or extradite commonly found\nSee further, Henrik Spang-Hanssen, Cyberspace &amp; International Law on Jurisdiction (Copenhagen: DJØF Publishing, 2004), chaps. 31, 32; Tallinn Manual, 18.\nPara. 47 of the Joint Separate Opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal, Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Dem. Rep. Congo v. Belgium), ICJ Rep. 2002, p. 3.\nAn oft-cited case in support of this principle is the English House of Lords judgment in Joyce v. DPP [1946] AC 34.\n\nin many multilateral conventions on suppression of serious crimes of international concern like international terrorism.\nWith regard to the jurisdiction to enforce, as early as 1928, the Permanent Court of Arbitration enunciated the principle that a State “cannot take measures on the territory of another state by way of enforcement of national laws without the consent of the latter”. This principle was also affirmed by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Lotus case, adding that: “In these circumstances, all that can be required of a State is that it should not overstep the limits which international law places upon its jurisdiction; within these limits, its title to exercise jurisdiction rests in its sovereignty”.\nTherefore, a State may not enforce its criminal law, that is, investigate crimes or arrest suspects, in the territory of another State without that other State’s consent. In this regard, it should be noted that the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (or the Budapest Convention), which is the only multilateral agreement in force on cybercrime, utilizes territorial jurisdiction and jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender as the bases for exercise of jurisdiction over cyber criminal offences.\nAccording to a study by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in general, “forms of territoriality-based and nationality-based jurisdiction are almost always able to ensure a sufficient connection between cybercrime acts and at least one State”. The territoriality-based jurisdiction “can be made with reference to elements or effects of [a cybercrime], or the location of computer systems or data utilized for the offence”.\nUtilization of cloud services poses new challenges for law enforcement. Cloud computing, or Internet-based computing, delivers information services and information over the Internet, without the need for certain hardware or software at the\n Cf.

Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State. The development of the national organization of States during the last few centuries and, as a corollary, the development of international law, have established this principle of the exclusive competence of the State in regard to its own territory in such a way as to make it the point of departure in settling most questions that concern international relations.* (*Island of Palmas Case* (*Netherlands/United States of America*), Award of 4 April 1928, *UNRIAA*, vol.

The extraterritoriality issue takes a new dimension as applied to cloud computing because of the lack of any physically located hardware and a data location may cross national borders and may not be known to users, thus questioning any State’s jurisdiction in the first place. The processing in cloud computing may occur in several States simultaneously. It is submitted that in this type of situation more than one State have concurrent jurisdiction over a crime committed via cloud computing, pursuant to any one of jurisdictional bases mentioned above insofar as it is applicable to the facts in question.\nCurrently, fibre-optic cables buried in the seabed are the main conduits of the Internet since satellites have limited capacity compared to cables and are, thus, much more expensive and their use is confined mainly to broadcasting as well as for Internet usage by communities in very remote regions.\nA State has sovereignty over communication cables lying within its land territory, internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It can adopt laws and regulations to protect submarine cables in its territorial sea, for example. To accommodate the interest of existing submarine cables, the law of the sea as codified in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS) requires an archipelagic State, which is recognized pursuant to UNCLOS, to respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. In addition, an archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them. In the maritime area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea called the “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State is measured, all States generally enjoy the freedom of the laying of submarine cables, with due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS and other rules of international law insofar as they are not incompatible therewith. This freedom is permissible as it is not an exercise of sovereign rights over the natural resources which is reserved exclusively for the coastal State in whose EEZ the laying of submarine cables takes place.\n Nancy J.

All States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the continental shelf of another State. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables. The coastal State may set conditions for cables entering its land territory, internal waters or territorial sea. The coastal State also has jurisdiction over cables constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. When laying submarine cables, States are required to have due regard to cables already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables shall not be prejudiced.\nInternational law is silent as to whether and to what extent such cables are subject to the jurisdiction of the States that own them or whose nationals have laid and operate them. In particular, it is doubtful whether these States may take the measures necessary to protect their cables against malicious interference. Marine cables protection zones are permitted in the territorial sea, by virtue of Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS, but not in maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the case of submarine cables lying beyond the territorial sea, Article 113 of UNCLOS requires every State to criminalize their breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications. The provision predated the age of the Internet. Nevertheless, as fibre-optic cables are used in telecommunication that includes telephonic communications, the cables are covered under this UNCLOS provision. This provision applies also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, but it does not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury. Article 114 of UNCLOS requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable, cause a break in or injury to another cable, they shall bear the cost of the repairs. Article 115 requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.\nBesides UNCLOS, the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, in force since 1 May 1888, regulates interference with telegraph cables outside territorial waters of its Parties. It accords the competent jurisdiction to the court of the State in which the vessel in question is registered (“flag State”) and the State of nationality of the offender, in that order. The Convention makes it a punishable offence to break or injure a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages. This provision does not apply to cases where those who break or injure a cable do so with the lawful object of saving their lives or their ship, after they have taken every necessary precaution to avoid so breaking or injuring the cable. There are merely 41 States Parties to the 1884 Convention, though.\nWith regard to unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, Article 109 of UNCLOS requires all States to cooperate in its suppression. “Unauthorized broadcasting” is defined as “the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls”. This provision predated the era of the Internet, and one may question whether it covers transmission by cyber means. It is hereby submitted that if there is some cyber involvement in transmitting sound radio or television broadcast such as using cyber-facilitated means to stream radio and television via the Internet or to disseminate information, especially through social media platforms such as Twitter, vk.com, Facebook, this definition of broadcasting can be interpreted to cover transmission via the Internet. This present author agrees with the position of the majority of the experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the object and purpose of proscribing unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas are primarily the prevention of interference with broadcasting that is not in compliance with international regulations, such as the regulation of broadcasting frequencies, and produces negative effects on maritime or air communications. The posting of online material, including online propaganda, from the high seas poses no such risks and is not covered by this prohibition -- there is no difference whether online material is posted from a vessel in the high seas or on land. The following provisions on unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas must be understood in this context.\nArticle 109 of UNCLOS provides that any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas may be prosecuted before the court of: (a) the flag State of the ship from which the broadcast is made; (b) the State of registry of the installation from which the broadcast is made; (c) the State of which the person is a national; (d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or (e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference. The State having the said jurisdiction may, in conformity with Article 110 of UNCLOS, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus. Article 110 stipulates that, except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign\nship, other than a warship or a ship owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service, may board it if there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the foreign ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109; the foreign ship is without nationality; or though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship. Article 110 applies mutatis mutandis to military aircraft as well as to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service which encounter the suspected ship.\nUNCLOS is supplemented by other international instruments in this matter. For example, the 1965 European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations Outside National Territories regulates broadcasting stations which are installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other floating or airborne objects and which, outside national territories, transmit broadcasts intended for reception or capable of being received, wholly or in part, within the territory of any Contracting Party, or which cause harmful interference to any radio-communication service operating under the authority of a Contracting Party in accordance with the Radio Regulations. Each Contracting Party undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of the said broadcasting, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, apply the provisions of this Agreement in regard to its nationals who have committed any of the aforesaid offences on its territory, ships, or aircraft, or outside national territories on any ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne object; and non-nationals who, on its territory, ships or aircraft, or on board any floating or airborne object under its jurisdiction have committed any of such acts. The Agreement implements the said Radio Regulations, annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, which prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories. The Regulations define broadcasting stations as those in the “broadcasting service”, which is itself defined as a radio-communication service of transmissions to be received directly by the general public, including transmissions of sounds or transmissions by television, facsimile or other means. The term “other means” is broad enough to cover the Internet and other cyber-facilitated means of broadcasting.\nWith regard to the right of visit in the high seas, Article 110 of UNCLOS authorizes warships or other duly authorized vessels or aircraft to board a foreign vessel encountered on the high seas which is not a foreign warship or vessel owned or operated by a foreign State and used only on government non-commercial service when there is a “reasonable ground for suspecting” it is engaged in piracy, slave trading or unauthorized broadcasting, appears to be without nationality, or is of the nationality of the visiting vessel but appears to be disguising its nationality. However, the International Group of Experts writing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were split as to\n2.1 Jurisdiction\nwhether the right of visit includes the right of “virtual visit”, for example, by using cyber means to verify the nationality of the vessel concerned by monitoring its communications, and inspect its cyber infrastructure remotely when suspicion remains that the vessel is engaged in any of the aforesaid proscribed activities. This present author submits that it does so include.\nIn a near future, global Internet access from satellites, akin to rebuilding the Internet in space, may become a real possibility. The draftsmen of the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime considered it unnecessary to establish jurisdiction over offences involving satellites registered in the name of a State, because unlawful communications by satellites originated from and/or was received on earth, and the satellites were mere mediums of transmission. This perception may need to be reconsidered in light of the report that nation-State hackers have, since 2007, used a Digital Video Broadband satellite provider covering the Middle East and Africa to hide the actual location and activities of advanced persistent threat (APT) from the “Turla” malware attack. Latching onto unencrypted connections between active IP addresses and satellites to route the traffic to an unused port disguised as the legitimate IP of the user makes the APTs almost impossible to shut down because the cyber infrastructure hosting the cyberattack is not traceable. Although satellite communications usually provide slow and frequently unstable speeds, this cyberattack method is relatively inexpensive to implement, at the cost of initial investment of less than US$1000 and regular maintenance of less than US$1000 per year. Google, an important Internet Service Provider (ISP), has “Project Loon” which launches balloons into the stratospheres, at least 20 km (12 miles) above the earth surface, to beam Internet access to users beneath the balloons’ path. Internet connectivity on board an aircraft is now made possible via an antenna on the aircraft’s fuselage which exchanges signals to and from the ground through the nearest satellite in a chain of geostationary satellites situated around the equator approximately 36,000 km above the earth. Space law, thus, becomes relevant to the use of cyberspace.\nArticle VIII of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, chap. 8 Law of the sea.\n “SpaceX chief Musk eyes Internet satellites: report,” China Post, 12 Nov. 2014, 6; Melody Peterson, “Google may invest in SpaceX to back Elon Musk’s satellite project,” Los Angeles Times, 19 Jan. 2015; “SpaceX aims to launch internet from space”, BBC, 17 Nov. 2016.\n Explanatory Report of 8 Nov. 2001 to the convention adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, para. 234, cited in Spang-Hanssen, Public International Computer Network Law Issues, 318.\n Dan Worth, “Turla APT malware threat uses satellites to avoid detection,” Security, 9 Sept. 2015, reporting on the finding of Kaspersky Lab.

Of course, this is subject to other permissible bases of jurisdiction exercisable by other States as explained above. Article III of the Treaty stipulates that space activities are to be carried out “in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding”. They must also be for peaceful purposes, but this does not preclude the right to exercise self-defence in outer space or by employing space-based assets to defend against armed attacks launched from outer space against targets on earth.\n## 2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nActors in cyberspace are States, individuals, other non-State actors, and their proxies. There are problems in attributing a cyber activity to any specific person or entity, especially in light of the anonymity of the author of that activity whose identification depends on the ability of the interested party to verify, or back trace, that author.\nSuch anonymity may be achieved in several ways. Virtual private networking (VPN) tunnels the entire network traffic which is encrypted between the start (“client”) and the endpoint (“server”) located elsewhere before data is transmitted to the resource that the user is actually trying to access. Another method is using proxy servers which allow users to hide their IP address by tunnelling all specific types of traffic through another server, and the accessed host need not be a web server. Yet another method is the use of anonymous networks with the “onion routing” technique, utilizing multiple public or private proxy servers to relay encrypted data across many randomly chosen nodes on the anonymity network with multiple layers of encryption applied to the transmitted data, and each relay node decrypting the following layer until the original data is revealed and sent to the intended recipient. Another method involves infecting the computer of another person with malware so that the person planting the malware can control that computer in order to undertake\n United Kingdom Treaty Ser.

Finally, users may conceal their personal information or identities to remain anonymous online.\nIt may be possible to validate the origin of data and verify the sender’s digital signature through a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) which validates a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication, but this is not popularly used.\nFor the purpose of attribution in cyberspace, one must identify the originating source of communication by going over the route by which the communication has come, the person/entity behind it, and whether that person/entity is directed or controlled by another person/entity or a State.\nBack-tracing or back-tracking is the most common method to identify the afore-said point of departure. This includes locating the IP address or addresses, determining the point of contact, and luring the hacker into revealing more details about his/its identity. The more proficient the hacker is, the less successful the back-tracing becomes. However, some types of data that can be collected are relatively difficult to hide and the patterns of how a person browses and clicks through a website may lead to his/its identity.\nEven where a cyberattack has no international connection, law enforcement authorities not infrequently run into difficulties in apprehending the right perpetrator. In Japan, for example, in 2012 a hacker named Yusuke Katayama (a.k.a. Demon Killer) infected computers belonging to strangers with a Trojan Horse virus and then sent death threats from these computers. Several persons who owned the computers remotely controlled by Katayama were wrongly arrested and subsequently exonerated. Only after Katayama had made an error by sending a riddle containing information that could only have been known by the real perpetrator of the death threats were the police able to identify and arrest him. The police were told by a message to look for a cat at a specific location. The cat was wearing a collar on which was a memory card with details of the code and malicious programme Katayama had used to gain remote control of his victims’ computers. The cat was seen with Katayama on CCTV footage, leading to his arrest in February 2013.\nThe hackers of the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system in November and December 2014 did not connect directly to Sony’s network, but attacked it by connecting through one or more relay computers at different locations (or using the “stepping stone” systems) in order to hide their actual location. The first evidence of the hack was reported to have been traced to a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, and then New York, Poland, Italy, Bolivia, Singapore, and Cyprus.

The attack caused thousands of Sony’s computers inoperable, stole proprietary information and employees’ personal identifiable information and confidential communications. The hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace (GoP) made threats against cinemas intending to show the film *The Interview*, a comedy produced by Sony about the assassination of North Korea’s Head of State, and their audiences. On 1 December 2014, the FBI issued a five-page confidential warning to US businesses in general that cyber hackers had used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US, making it impossible to recover any lost data. It gave some technical details about the malware and the advice on how to deal with such an attack.\nSubsequently, the FBI attributed the Sony hack to North Korea on the grounds that: (a) the malware used in the hack had “clear links” to malware developed by North Korea which had been used in a cyberattack in March 2014 against South Korean banks and media outlets, and had been traced to an IP address in Pyongyang, North Korea; (b) the tools used in the said Sony attack had “similarities” to the ones developed by North Korea in specific lines of computer code, encryption algorithms, and data deletion methods; and (c) the statements and threats in connection with the Sony attacks were similar in terms of behaviour to other known attacks by the North Koreans. The North Korean Government itself initially refused to deny that it was behind the Sony hack, but subsequently denied it outright and challenged the US to provide evidence to substantiate any allegation that North Korea was the culprit.\nThe FBI’s attribution was not free from criticisms. Skeptics contended that the FBI was very careful not to allege that the attack was controlled from within North Korea. It was also doubted whether a nation State like North Korea could have acted alone without assistance from outside. The FBI insisted that it had “undisclosed intelligence” to confirm the attribution of the Sony attack to North Korea, but doubts about the veracity of such intelligence were raised, drawing a comparison between it and the undisclosed – and subsequently proven to be false – intelligence on\n “Sony hack puts spotlight on Pyongyang ISP,” *Bangkok Post*, 20 Dec. 2014; Lev Grossman, “What Sony’s Hackers Know”, *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 20.\n “FBI warns firms of destructive malware use by hackers,” BBC, 2 Dec. 2014.\n “Obama vows response to ‘N Korea cyber attack’”, *Al Jazeera*, 19 Dec. 2014; “Sony hack: Obama vows response as FBI blames North Korea,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; “FBI director gives new clues tying North Korea to Sony hack,” *Associated Press*, 7 Jan. 2015; Alex Altman and Sam Frizell, “Hollywood Hacked: Why no company is immune,” *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 19.\n “North Korea refuses to deny Sony Pictures cyber-attack”, *BBC*, 1 Dec. 2014. When asked about its possible involvement in the hack, a spokesman at North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the UN in New York replied: “The hostile forces are relating everything to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I kindly advise you to just wait and see.”\n Madison Park and Dana Ford, “North Korea to U.S.: Show evidence we hacked Sony,” *CNN*, 14 Jan. 2015, reporting on the press briefing on 13 Jan. 2015 by North Korea’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, New York.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nSaddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction”. Adding to the confusion was a claim by the group named Lizard Squad which had repeatedly hacked Sony’s network in 2014. An alleged member of the Lizard Squad gave an interview claiming that the group had shared some login data stolen from Sony’s employees with the Guardians of Peace, thereby throwing some doubt on the theory that the North Korean Government was behind the Sony hack at all. There was also a possibility that the hack could have been contracted out by the North Korean Government to private hackers.\nOne of the lessons from this Sony hack episode, according to two experts on cybersecurity, is that attribution of cyberattacks is hard, “mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion”, not the court of law. The same could be said of: (a) the conclusion in 2013 by US cybersecurity firm Mandiant that the Chinese Government was behind one of the world’s prolific group of computer hackers since these hackers could be traced to a location near Shanghai in China which is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a signals intelligence division of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA); and (b) the report in September 2015 by ThreatConnect and Defense Group Inc. The latter based its attribution of the spyware and “phishing” attacks studied to a hacker collectively known as “Nikon” at a military intelligence unit of the PLA in Kunming, southern China. A member of the Chinese military was identified as the operator of a domain called “GreenSky27” from which the spyware and attacks originated, based on his profile, online activities, and academic publications.\nIndeed, no one has ever come up with conclusive, as opposed to circumstantial evidence, as to who hacked the White House in October 2014, JPMorgan, Nasdaq, and so forth. The 20 March 2013 cyberattack, known as “Dark Seoul”, paralyzed approximately 48,000 computers at several major banks and broadcasters in South Korea, disrupting network systems and deleting files in their hard disks. The cyber hack occurred not long after, owing to the growing tensions between the two Koreas, the North Korean Government had announced it would terminate the armistice agreement which had ended the Korean War in July 1953. On 23 December 2014, computers at South Korea’s nuclear operator were breached, with the hackers trying to steal data, including plant blueprints and personnel information, therefrom. South Korean investigators were reported to have said that they had proof that the hacking\n Dave Lee, “What is FBI evidence for North Korea hack attack?,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; Brian Todd and Ben Brumfield, “Experts doubt North Korea was behind the Sony hack”, CNN, 27 Dec. 2014. A security expert who was part of the South Korean Government’s investigation into the March 2013 cyberattacks attributed to North Korea was reported to have opined that, unlike the March 2013 attack, the Sony attack in December 2014 could not be linked to IP addresses in North Korea (“Security experts doubt North Korea hacked Sony,” Taiwan News, 4 Dec. 2014, 6).\n “Sony hackers ‘shared’ stolen employee login data,” BBC, 30 Dec. 2014.\n Peter W.

In the case of the Sony hack, The New York Times alleged in January 2015 that in 2010 the NSA had “drilled into the Chinese networks that connect North Korea to the outside world, picked through connections in Malaysia favored by North Korean hackers and penetrated directly into the North with the help of South Korea and other American allies, according to former United States and foreign officials, computer experts later briefed on the operations and a newly disclosed NSA document … [and managed to] place malware that could track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by the North’s hackers”. According to the newspaper, it was the evidence gathered by the malware planted by the NSA to track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by North Korea’s hackers that convinced the US authorities that North Korea had been behind the Sony hack.\nSince 19 October 2015, Facebook notifies its users whenever it believes that their accounts have been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working for a nation State, so that the users can take security measures to secure their online accounts. This is when the attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others and when detailed analyses by Facebook’s own technical experts, taking into account victims’ reports, show strong indication of the involvement of States or State-sponsored entities or persons. Facebook thus follows Google which has taken a similar step since mid-2012. Microsoft has taken the same measure since 30 December 2015.\n## 2.2.1 ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility\nGuidance on attribution for the purpose of international law of State responsibility is to be sought from the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (2001), which has been relied extensively by the International Court of Justice to interpret international law in this matter.

The actions of non-State actors may also sometimes be attributable to States.”58\nChapter II of the ILC’s Draft Articles, entitled “Attribution of conduct to a State”, explains the rules as follows.\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails that State’s international responsibility.59 The State is treated as a unity, consistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. Therefore, the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. In this connection, a State organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.60 The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority is considered an act attributed to the State under international law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.61 If an organ is placed at the disposal of a State by another State, the conduct of such organ is considered an act of the former State under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the State at whose disposal it is placed.62 The conduct of such an organ of a State or a person or entity is considered an act attributed to the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.63\nBesides, the conduct of a person or group of persons is considered an act attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of that State in carrying out the conduct.64 A general situation of dependence on or support from a State is insufficient for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of the person or group of persons to the State – the State must be able to assert “effective control” over the\n\nRule 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States” (ibid., 26). However, there is no consensus as to whether this Rule also applies if the State has only constructive (“should have known”) knowledge or whether this Rule applies to States through which cyber operations are routed (ibid., p. 28). See also ibid., 34–36.\n\nconduct in question in the sense of the State’s actual participation of and directions given to the conduct. The International Court of Justice has affirmed that:\nState’s responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons — neither State organs nor to be equated with such organs — only if, assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful, they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in Article 8 [of the ILC’s Draft Articles mentioned above]. This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed...\nThis means the “effective control” must be exercised, or that the State’s instructions are given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations. The ICJ rejects the “overall control” test as “stretch[ing] too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”.\nThe US position regarding “proxy actors” in cyberspace is in line with the test just mentioned. According to the US,\nStates are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors”, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it. ...\nThe ILC’s Draft Articles also cover exceptional cases, such as during revolution, armed conflict or foreign occupation, where the regular authorities dissolve, are disintegrating, have been suppressed or are for the time being inoperative, as well as cases where lawful authority is being gradually restored, e.g., after foreign occupation. In these circumstances, the conduct of a person or group of persons is\n Para. (4), ILC Commentary to Art. 8 and para.

However, where the movement achieves its aims and either installs itself as the new Government of the State or forms a new State in part of the territory of the pre-existing State or in a territory under its administration, its conduct is considered to be attributable to that State under international law, and the predecessor State will not be responsible for that conduct except in exceptional cases where the predecessor State was in a position to adopt measures of vigilance, prevention or punishment in respect of the movement’s conduct but improperly failed to do so and this has resulted in an injury or damage to another State.72\nWhere a State acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own, that conduct is considered an act of that State under international to the extent acknowledged and adopted as such by the State.73\nFinally, State A is internationally responsible for aiding or assisting State B in the commission of an international wrongful act by State B if State A does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and if the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by State A itself.74 This requires a close connection between the act of aiding or assisting and the eventual wrongful act of State B. The support must have a substantial effect in the sense of making it materially easier to commit the wrongful act which State A is obligated not to commit itself.75\nIn addition to responsibility for cyber activities attributed to a State, general international law imposes on every State the due diligence duty “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This rule has been laid down by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.76 The territorial State must exercise its due diligence duty as it can be reasonably expected to do so. Thus, a transit State where the Internet is routed through its territory or a developing State from where a cyber activity is launched can only be expected to take any action\n\nexpected of it when it becomes aware of the activity and only in accordance with its technological capability.\nAlthough the International Group of Experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual could not agree whether constructive knowledge sufficed to entail the due diligence duty, this present author believes that a State must, according to either its actual or constructive knowledge and in light of its technological capability, take measures as may be reasonably expected of it to prevent or stop its territory from being used by a cyberattacker to injure another State. However, it will take time for State practice to settle on what such reasonable measures actually are.\n## 2.2.2 Standard(s) of Proof\nIn apprehending cyber criminals, law enforcement authorities arrest suspects on the basis of evidence which must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt in a criminal court of law. In case of State responsibility, however, the accuser must prove that an unlawful cyber activity is “attributable” or “attributed” to a State using the applicable international legal standard explained in Sect. 2.2.1.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s Rule 7 (Cyber operations launched from governmental infrastructure) reads: “The mere fact that a cyber operation has been launched or otherwise originates from governmental cyber infrastructure is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State but is an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation”. Its Rule 8 (Cyber operations routed through a State) provides: “The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State.” The rules are sound, bearing in mind that the origin of the massive cyberattack on Estonia, of which Tallinn is its capital city, in April and May 2007 was traced back to 177 other States around the world!\n“Clear and compelling” information or evidence was cited by the US and NATO in support of their conclusion that Al-Qaeda was behind the 11 September 2001\n Michael N.

This standard is higher than that of “preponderance of the evidence” (i.e., “more likely than not”) in certain civil and administrative proceedings but lower than that of “beyond a reasonable doubt” in criminal law. The ICJ in *Oil Platform (Islamic Republic of Iran v. USA)* uses the terms “direct evidence”, which is not merely “suggestive”, and “conclusive” evidence. It is the State making the assertion which bears the burden of proof. In other cases, the ICJ refers to the need for “conclusive evidence”, “a degree of certainty”, “inferences of fact …[which] leave no room for reasonable doubt”, “degree of certainty … supported by convincing evidence”, “clear evidence”, “[relevant facts] convincingly established by the evidence”, “evidence [that is] weighty and convincing”, and “evidence that is fully conclusive”.\nOne veteran cyber threat analyst suggests some set of rules of thumb to prove attribution. Firstly, identify the architects of the malware by looking at a particular, identifying style of the malware. Secondly, consider the timing of the attack which may show the context in which the attack occurs. Thirdly, look at the victims to find out who would benefit from the attack. The analyst concludes, however, that in the end it comes down to a matter of speculation. Even when low-level, unsophisticated hacking against a group of persons opposed to the terrorist group operating under the name of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was discovered, it could not be confirmed that the hacking came from ISIL. Ironically, North Korea’s Internet was suddenly shut down for 9 h and 31 min on 22–23 December 2014 with no one claiming responsibility at that time, and it could not be proven then whether this was a counterattack by the US Government or by hacktivist groups like Anonymous which had targeted North\n Letter dated 7 Oct. 2001 from the Permanent Rep. of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N.

Only in July 2015 did the Director of the NSA and Commander of the US Cyber Command disclose to the public that he had advised the US President to retaliate against North Korea for the Sony hack.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that in the context of measures of unilateral self-help, the reality is that States must make unilateral ex ante determinations with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State before responding and that such determinations may be subject to post factum review of the applicable burden of proof. States are, thus, expected to act as reasonable States objectively would in same or similar circumstances, taking into due consideration such cumulative factors as the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the evidence when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.\nOne learned author argues that the test of proving attribution for the purpose of State responsibility as explained above is out of touch with cyber reality. According to this view, “attribution asymmetry” in cyberspace makes it more difficult for the victim State to trace cyberattacks from non-State actors who are assisted by a State, while making it easier for the State behind the cyberattacks to control such attacks. This, arguably, provides an incentive for the victim State to resort to using non-State actors to counterattack the State it suspects to be behind an initial attack. A test focusing on “virtual control” is proposed instead, with the burden shifting to a State to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyberattack when that State funds and equips a non-State actor who subsequently launch a cyberattack – this is because the funding/equipping State has greater access to the relevant information concerning possible attribution of responsibility than the victim State does. It would also establish a rebuttable presumption that when State infrastructure is used for a cyberattack, the State owning the infrastructure is responsible. The new test would also help ensure that the State exercise due diligence not to allow its territory, infrastructure, equipment, or funding to be used for a cyberattack against another State – and if it fails to be duly diligent this would entail State responsibility. The new test would draw upon the ICJ’s reasoning in Nicaragua v. USA where the ICJ noted that the contras continued to fight in Nicaragua even after the US Government had ended its funding to the group on 1 October 1984; hence, a rebuttable presumption that, subject to evidence to the contrary, the US was no longer in control of the contras. Disassociation from non-State actors suspected of launching a cyberattack\n Jo Biddle, “N.

USA Judgment. He also cited the ICTY App. Ch. Judgment in Tadic (Case No. IT-94-1-A, 15 Jul 1999) that the continuing salary payment by the Rep. of Yugoslavia to an armed group did indicate control of the group by the Rep. of Yugoslavia.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nalso shows the good faith on the part of the disassociating State. It could take years to see if this proposed new test will be endorsed by State practice in relation to cyberspace. In the meantime, all the factors cited in support of the proposed new test can be taken into consideration in determining whether a cyber activity is attributable to a State pursuant to the existing international law of State responsibility.\nPresently, we may sometimes see the different positions/standards on attribution adopted by intelligence agencies, on the one hand, and law enforcement agencies, on the other hand. The former assess information and evidence, including circumstantial evidence and undisclosed human intelligence, to substantiate their suspicion that an entity or person is behind a cyberattack. The latter usually needs evidence that can stand up in courts of law before they can conclude who is the perpetrator of a cyberattack. This should explain the position taken by the US intelligence agencies and the initial one taken by the FBI, a US national law enforcement agency, in the aftermath of the allegations that a foreign State was behind cyber activities to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016.\nIn international relations, it is diplomatically wise and legally permissible to respond to an offensive act by another State commensurate with the level of certainty that the other State is behind the act: the more certain the evidence is, the more severe the response can be, provided that the response does not exceed the permissible bounds of international law. This will be explained in Sect. 4.7 below.\n## 2.2.3 Attribution and International Organizations, Such As NATO\nIn 2011, the ILC finished its work on the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (DARIOs), which closely follow the ILC’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n Libicki, Crisis, 22–23. For a similar argument, see, Constantine Antonopoulos, “State Responsibility in Cyberspace,” in Research Handbook, eds., Tsagourias and Buchan, 30–54.\n Sam Biddle, “Here’s the Public Evidence Russia Hacked the DNC – It’s Not Enough”, Intercept, 14 Dec. 2016; Kevin Johnson, “FBI accepts CIA conclusion that Russians hacked to help Trump”, USA Today, 16 Dec. 2016.\nDisclosure: As of this writing, the present author was an ambassador to the Russian Federation and was, therefore, bound by diplomatic etiquette not to comment on his host State’s relations with a third State. Readers are invited to judge by themselves whether the evidence revealed by the US Government met the international law standard(s) of proof explained in this Sect. 2.2.2. The declassified version of a highly classified assessment by the US Intelligence Community made public on 6 Jan. 2017 and entitled “Background to ‘Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections’: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution” is available at: https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf.\n For criticisms of DARIOS, see the joint position of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), IFAD, ICO, IMO, IOM, ITU, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Preparatory Commission for CTBTO, UNIDO, UNTWO, WHO, WIPO, WMO and WTO before\n\nArticle 3 of DARIOS stipulates: “Every international wrongful act of an international organization entails the international responsibility of that organization”.\nAs a general rule, attribution of responsibility between an international organization and its Member States depends on the constituent instruments, decisions, resolutions and other acts of the international organization adopted in accordance with those instruments, and established practice of the organization. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, for example, is an organization where “the fundamental internal rule governing the functioning of the organization – that of consensus decision-making – is to be found neither in the treaties establishing NATO nor in any formal rules and is, rather, the result of the practice of the organization”.\nIn Behrami and Saramati, the European Court of Human Rights rules that as the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) led by NATO acted on the authorization of the UN Security Council, the acts complained against UNMIK and KFOR were attributable to the United Nations. However, the Grand Chamber of the same Court rules in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom that the UN Security Council “had neither effective control nor ultimate authority and control over the acts and omissions of foreign troops within the Multi-National Force [in Iraq] and that the applicant’s detention was not, therefore, attributable to the United Nations”; hence, the detention complained of in that case had to be attributed to the State detaining the complainant.\nAttributing to an international organization ultra vires acts taken by its organ takes is supported by international jurisprudence and practice of international organizations as well as policy considerations that “denying attribution of conduct may deprive third parties of all redresses, unless conduct could be attributable to a State or another organization”. Draft Article 9 of DARIOs also makes it clear that conduct which is not otherwise attributable to an international organization shall nevertheless be considered an act of that organization under international law if and to the extent that the organization acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\nthe 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 26 Oct. 2011 (Doc.

Such jurisdiction is based on territoriality, passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace that spans the land, sea, air and outer space domains. In order to hold a State responsible for a cyber activity, that activity must be attributed to the State in accordance with international rules on attribution for the purpose of responsibility, including the applicable standard of proof. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the controversy surrounding alleged foreign interference by cyber means in the 2016 US Presidential election show the difficult challenges for the application of these rules. International organizations can be held accountable for cyber activities attributable to them, too.\nKeywords Jurisdiction in cyberspace • Attribution in cyberspace • State responsibility for cyber activities • 2014 Sony Pictures hacks and international law • Attribution for the 2016 US Presidential election hacks\n## 2.1 Jurisdiction\nWhile no State may claim sovereignty over cyberspace as such, States may exercise sovereign prerogatives over any cyber infrastructure situated on their territory as well as activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Such prerogatives\n See, generally, Secretariat of the International Law Commission, *Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of the Fifty-eighth Session* (2006), UN Gen. Ass. Off. Records, 61st Sess., Supplement No. 10 (A/61/10), Annex E (Extraterritorial Jurisdiction), 516–532; Nicholas Tsagourias, “The Legal Status of Cyberspace” in *Research Handbook*, eds., Tsagourias and Buchan, 13 at 16–24.\n Michael N.

Jurisdiction to prescribe is the State's authority to legislate or prescribe law and regulations. Jurisdiction to enforce is the State's authority to enforce the law and regulations legislated or prescribed by it. There is also an adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts of the State to interpret its law and regulations.\nJurisdiction is primarily territorial. A State may exercise jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure and over the intangible based on territoriality, including “subjective territorial jurisdiction” over an incident originating in a State’s territory but consummated elsewhere, and “objective territorial jurisdiction” over individuals where an incident has effects on the State’s territory although the act was initiated elsewhere. This territorial jurisdiction extends to the airspace superjacent to the land territory and territorial waters under the State’s sovereignty. For example, a State has jurisdiction over civilian aircraft with airborne cyber infrastructure to hack into Wi-Fi networks or eavesdrop on cell phone calls and text messages and to exfiltrate or otherwise interfere with data in the State’s territory being overflown and may order the aircraft to land to submit to the jurisdiction of the territorial State for violation of its law. In case of State aircraft, they must get prior authorization from the territorial State over which they intend to overfly, and the authorization may comprise conditions, violation of which entitles the territorial State to demand that the aircraft in question cease the violation and depart its airspace without delay, and, if the aircraft refuses, to take necessary and proportional measures against that aircraft.\npersons coordinated by Prof. M.

Several States have also asserted jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender’s victim is a national of that State – this is based on the passive personality principle of jurisdiction. Three judges of the ICJ noted in February 2002 that passive personality jurisdiction, which was previously regarded as controversial, is now reflected in the legislation of various States including the US and France “and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so far as a particular category of offences is concerned”. The more serious the offences, the less likely that opposition to the exercise of passive personality jurisdiction will face. Passive personality jurisdiction is an option in, for example, the 1970 Hague Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 1985 Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture; the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance; the 1997 Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; the 1999 Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; the 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the 2006 Enforced Disappearance Convention; and the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism.\nA State may, based on the protective principle, exercise jurisdiction over the offender whose conduct abroad threatens that State’s security or interferes with the operation of its government functions.\nThe most controversial base of jurisdiction is universal jurisdiction, whereby a State asserts jurisdiction over a crime which has no connection (nexus) with that State at all. In other words, the crime is committed outside its territory, does not have any effect therein, and neither the perpetrator nor the victim is its national. It has long been accepted that every State may exercise universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of piracy. Apart from that, it is still controversial whether a State may exercise universal jurisdiction absent treaty obligations binding on the States concerned – as in the case of the obligation to prosecute or extradite commonly found\nSee further, Henrik Spang-Hanssen, Cyberspace &amp; International Law on Jurisdiction (Copenhagen: DJØF Publishing, 2004), chaps. 31, 32; Tallinn Manual, 18.\nPara. 47 of the Joint Separate Opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal, Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Dem.

DPP [1946] AC 34.\n\nin many multilateral conventions on suppression of serious crimes of international concern like international terrorism.\nWith regard to the jurisdiction to enforce, as early as 1928, the Permanent Court of Arbitration enunciated the principle that a State “cannot take measures on the territory of another state by way of enforcement of national laws without the consent of the latter”. This principle was also affirmed by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Lotus case, adding that: “In these circumstances, all that can be required of a State is that it should not overstep the limits which international law places upon its jurisdiction; within these limits, its title to exercise jurisdiction rests in its sovereignty”.\nTherefore, a State may not enforce its criminal law, that is, investigate crimes or arrest suspects, in the territory of another State without that other State’s consent. In this regard, it should be noted that the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (or the Budapest Convention), which is the only multilateral agreement in force on cybercrime, utilizes territorial jurisdiction and jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender as the bases for exercise of jurisdiction over cyber criminal offences.\nAccording to a study by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in general, “forms of territoriality-based and nationality-based jurisdiction are almost always able to ensure a sufficient connection between cybercrime acts and at least one State”. The territoriality-based jurisdiction “can be made with reference to elements or effects of [a cybercrime], or the location of computer systems or data utilized for the offence”.\nUtilization of cloud services poses new challenges for law enforcement.

The extraterritoriality issue takes a new dimension as applied to cloud computing because of the lack of any physically located hardware and a data location may cross national borders and may not be known to users, thus questioning any State’s jurisdiction in the first place. The processing in cloud computing may occur in several States simultaneously. It is submitted that in this type of situation more than one State have concurrent jurisdiction over a crime committed via cloud computing, pursuant to any one of jurisdictional bases mentioned above insofar as it is applicable to the facts in question.\nCurrently, fibre-optic cables buried in the seabed are the main conduits of the Internet since satellites have limited capacity compared to cables and are, thus, much more expensive and their use is confined mainly to broadcasting as well as for Internet usage by communities in very remote regions.\nA State has sovereignty over communication cables lying within its land territory, internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It can adopt laws and regulations to protect submarine cables in its territorial sea, for example. To accommodate the interest of existing submarine cables, the law of the sea as codified in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS) requires an archipelagic State, which is recognized pursuant to UNCLOS, to respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. In addition, an archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them. In the maritime area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea called the “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State is measured, all States generally enjoy the freedom of the laying of submarine cables, with due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS and other rules of international law insofar as they are not incompatible therewith. This freedom is permissible as it is not an exercise of sovereign rights over the natural resources which is reserved exclusively for the coastal State in whose EEZ the laying of submarine cables takes place.\n Nancy J.

All States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the continental shelf of another State. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables. The coastal State may set conditions for cables entering its land territory, internal waters or territorial sea. The coastal State also has jurisdiction over cables constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. When laying submarine cables, States are required to have due regard to cables already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables shall not be prejudiced.\nInternational law is silent as to whether and to what extent such cables are subject to the jurisdiction of the States that own them or whose nationals have laid and operate them. In particular, it is doubtful whether these States may take the measures necessary to protect their cables against malicious interference. Marine cables protection zones are permitted in the territorial sea, by virtue of Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS, but not in maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the case of submarine cables lying beyond the territorial sea, Article 113 of UNCLOS requires every State to criminalize their breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications. The provision predated the age of the Internet. Nevertheless, as fibre-optic cables are used in telecommunication that includes telephonic communications, the cables are covered under this UNCLOS provision. This provision applies also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, but it does not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury. Article 114 of UNCLOS requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable, cause a break in or injury to another cable, they shall bear the cost of the repairs. Article 115 requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.\nBesides UNCLOS, the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, in force since 1 May 1888, regulates interference with telegraph cables outside territorial waters of its Parties. It accords the competent jurisdiction to the court of the State in which the vessel in question is registered (“flag State”) and the State of nationality of the offender, in that order. The Convention makes it a punishable offence to break or injure a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages. This provision does not apply to cases where those who break or injure a cable do so with the lawful object of saving their lives or their ship, after they have taken every necessary precaution to avoid so breaking or injuring the cable. There are merely 41 States Parties to the 1884 Convention, though.\nWith regard to unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, Article 109 of UNCLOS requires all States to cooperate in its suppression. “Unauthorized broadcasting” is defined as “the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls”. This provision predated the era of the Internet, and one may question whether it covers transmission by cyber means. It is hereby submitted that if there is some cyber involvement in transmitting sound radio or television broadcast such as using cyber-facilitated means to stream radio and television via the Internet or to disseminate information, especially through social media platforms such as Twitter, vk.com, Facebook, this definition of broadcasting can be interpreted to cover transmission via the Internet. This present author agrees with the position of the majority of the experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the object and purpose of proscribing unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas are primarily the prevention of interference with broadcasting that is not in compliance with international regulations, such as the regulation of broadcasting frequencies, and produces negative effects on maritime or air communications. The posting of online material, including online propaganda, from the high seas poses no such risks and is not covered by this prohibition -- there is no difference whether online material is posted from a vessel in the high seas or on land. The following provisions on unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas must be understood in this context.\nArticle 109 of UNCLOS provides that any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas may be prosecuted before the court of: (a) the flag State of the ship from which the broadcast is made; (b) the State of registry of the installation from which the broadcast is made; (c) the State of which the person is a national; (d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or (e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference. The State having the said jurisdiction may, in conformity with Article 110 of UNCLOS, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus. Article 110 stipulates that, except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign\nship, other than a warship or a ship owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service, may board it if there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the foreign ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109; the foreign ship is without nationality; or though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship. Article 110 applies mutatis mutandis to military aircraft as well as to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service which encounter the suspected ship.\nUNCLOS is supplemented by other international instruments in this matter. For example, the 1965 European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations Outside National Territories regulates broadcasting stations which are installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other floating or airborne objects and which, outside national territories, transmit broadcasts intended for reception or capable of being received, wholly or in part, within the territory of any Contracting Party, or which cause harmful interference to any radio-communication service operating under the authority of a Contracting Party in accordance with the Radio Regulations. Each Contracting Party undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of the said broadcasting, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, apply the provisions of this Agreement in regard to its nationals who have committed any of the aforesaid offences on its territory, ships, or aircraft, or outside national territories on any ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne object; and non-nationals who, on its territory, ships or aircraft, or on board any floating or airborne object under its jurisdiction have committed any of such acts. The Agreement implements the said Radio Regulations, annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, which prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories. The Regulations define broadcasting stations as those in the “broadcasting service”, which is itself defined as a radio-communication service of transmissions to be received directly by the general public, including transmissions of sounds or transmissions by television, facsimile or other means. The term “other means” is broad enough to cover the Internet and other cyber-facilitated means of broadcasting.\nWith regard to the right of visit in the high seas, Article 110 of UNCLOS authorizes warships or other duly authorized vessels or aircraft to board a foreign vessel encountered on the high seas which is not a foreign warship or vessel owned or operated by a foreign State and used only on government non-commercial service when there is a “reasonable ground for suspecting” it is engaged in piracy, slave trading or unauthorized broadcasting, appears to be without nationality, or is of the nationality of the visiting vessel but appears to be disguising its nationality. However, the International Group of Experts writing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were split as to\n2.1 Jurisdiction\nwhether the right of visit includes the right of “virtual visit”, for example, by using cyber means to verify the nationality of the vessel concerned by monitoring its communications, and inspect its cyber infrastructure remotely when suspicion remains that the vessel is engaged in any of the aforesaid proscribed activities. This present author submits that it does so include.\nIn a near future, global Internet access from satellites, akin to rebuilding the Internet in space, may become a real possibility. The draftsmen of the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime considered it unnecessary to establish jurisdiction over offences involving satellites registered in the name of a State, because unlawful communications by satellites originated from and/or was received on earth, and the satellites were mere mediums of transmission. This perception may need to be reconsidered in light of the report that nation-State hackers have, since 2007, used a Digital Video Broadband satellite provider covering the Middle East and Africa to hide the actual location and activities of advanced persistent threat (APT) from the “Turla” malware attack. Latching onto unencrypted connections between active IP addresses and satellites to route the traffic to an unused port disguised as the legitimate IP of the user makes the APTs almost impossible to shut down because the cyber infrastructure hosting the cyberattack is not traceable. Although satellite communications usually provide slow and frequently unstable speeds, this cyberattack method is relatively inexpensive to implement, at the cost of initial investment of less than US$1000 and regular maintenance of less than US$1000 per year. Google, an important Internet Service Provider (ISP), has “Project Loon” which launches balloons into the stratospheres, at least 20 km (12 miles) above the earth surface, to beam Internet access to users beneath the balloons’ path. Internet connectivity on board an aircraft is now made possible via an antenna on the aircraft’s fuselage which exchanges signals to and from the ground through the nearest satellite in a chain of geostationary satellites situated around the equator approximately 36,000 km above the earth. Space law, thus, becomes relevant to the use of cyberspace.\nArticle VIII of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, chap. 8 Law of the sea.\n “SpaceX chief Musk eyes Internet satellites: report,” China Post, 12 Nov. 2014, 6; Melody Peterson, “Google may invest in SpaceX to back Elon Musk’s satellite project,” Los Angeles Times, 19 Jan. 2015; “SpaceX aims to launch internet from space”, BBC, 17 Nov. 2016.\n Explanatory Report of 8 Nov. 2001 to the convention adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, para. 234, cited in Spang-Hanssen, Public International Computer Network Law Issues, 318.\n Dan Worth, “Turla APT malware threat uses satellites to avoid detection,” Security, 9 Sept. 2015, reporting on the finding of Kaspersky Lab.

Of course, this is subject to other permissible bases of jurisdiction exercisable by other States as explained above. Article III of the Treaty stipulates that space activities are to be carried out “in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding”. They must also be for peaceful purposes, but this does not preclude the right to exercise self-defence in outer space or by employing space-based assets to defend against armed attacks launched from outer space against targets on earth.\n## 2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nActors in cyberspace are States, individuals, other non-State actors, and their proxies. There are problems in attributing a cyber activity to any specific person or entity, especially in light of the anonymity of the author of that activity whose identification depends on the ability of the interested party to verify, or back trace, that author.\nSuch anonymity may be achieved in several ways. Virtual private networking (VPN) tunnels the entire network traffic which is encrypted between the start (“client”) and the endpoint (“server”) located elsewhere before data is transmitted to the resource that the user is actually trying to access. Another method is using proxy servers which allow users to hide their IP address by tunnelling all specific types of traffic through another server, and the accessed host need not be a web server. Yet another method is the use of anonymous networks with the “onion routing” technique, utilizing multiple public or private proxy servers to relay encrypted data across many randomly chosen nodes on the anonymity network with multiple layers of encryption applied to the transmitted data, and each relay node decrypting the following layer until the original data is revealed and sent to the intended recipient. Another method involves infecting the computer of another person with malware so that the person planting the malware can control that computer in order to undertake\n United Kingdom Treaty Ser.

Finally, users may conceal their personal information or identities to remain anonymous online.\nIt may be possible to validate the origin of data and verify the sender’s digital signature through a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) which validates a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication, but this is not popularly used.\nFor the purpose of attribution in cyberspace, one must identify the originating source of communication by going over the route by which the communication has come, the person/entity behind it, and whether that person/entity is directed or controlled by another person/entity or a State.\nBack-tracing or back-tracking is the most common method to identify the afore-said point of departure. This includes locating the IP address or addresses, determining the point of contact, and luring the hacker into revealing more details about his/its identity. The more proficient the hacker is, the less successful the back-tracing becomes. However, some types of data that can be collected are relatively difficult to hide and the patterns of how a person browses and clicks through a website may lead to his/its identity.\nEven where a cyberattack has no international connection, law enforcement authorities not infrequently run into difficulties in apprehending the right perpetrator. In Japan, for example, in 2012 a hacker named Yusuke Katayama (a.k.a. Demon Killer) infected computers belonging to strangers with a Trojan Horse virus and then sent death threats from these computers. Several persons who owned the computers remotely controlled by Katayama were wrongly arrested and subsequently exonerated. Only after Katayama had made an error by sending a riddle containing information that could only have been known by the real perpetrator of the death threats were the police able to identify and arrest him. The police were told by a message to look for a cat at a specific location. The cat was wearing a collar on which was a memory card with details of the code and malicious programme Katayama had used to gain remote control of his victims’ computers. The cat was seen with Katayama on CCTV footage, leading to his arrest in February 2013.\nThe hackers of the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system in November and December 2014 did not connect directly to Sony’s network, but attacked it by connecting through one or more relay computers at different locations (or using the “stepping stone” systems) in order to hide their actual location. The first evidence of the hack was reported to have been traced to a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, and then New York, Poland, Italy, Bolivia, Singapore, and Cyprus.

The attack caused thousands of Sony’s computers inoperable, stole proprietary information and employees’ personal identifiable information and confidential communications. The hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace (GoP) made threats against cinemas intending to show the film *The Interview*, a comedy produced by Sony about the assassination of North Korea’s Head of State, and their audiences. On 1 December 2014, the FBI issued a five-page confidential warning to US businesses in general that cyber hackers had used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US, making it impossible to recover any lost data. It gave some technical details about the malware and the advice on how to deal with such an attack.\nSubsequently, the FBI attributed the Sony hack to North Korea on the grounds that: (a) the malware used in the hack had “clear links” to malware developed by North Korea which had been used in a cyberattack in March 2014 against South Korean banks and media outlets, and had been traced to an IP address in Pyongyang, North Korea; (b) the tools used in the said Sony attack had “similarities” to the ones developed by North Korea in specific lines of computer code, encryption algorithms, and data deletion methods; and (c) the statements and threats in connection with the Sony attacks were similar in terms of behaviour to other known attacks by the North Koreans. The North Korean Government itself initially refused to deny that it was behind the Sony hack, but subsequently denied it outright and challenged the US to provide evidence to substantiate any allegation that North Korea was the culprit.\nThe FBI’s attribution was not free from criticisms. Skeptics contended that the FBI was very careful not to allege that the attack was controlled from within North Korea. It was also doubted whether a nation State like North Korea could have acted alone without assistance from outside. The FBI insisted that it had “undisclosed intelligence” to confirm the attribution of the Sony attack to North Korea, but doubts about the veracity of such intelligence were raised, drawing a comparison between it and the undisclosed – and subsequently proven to be false – intelligence on\n “Sony hack puts spotlight on Pyongyang ISP,” *Bangkok Post*, 20 Dec. 2014; Lev Grossman, “What Sony’s Hackers Know”, *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 20.\n “FBI warns firms of destructive malware use by hackers,” BBC, 2 Dec. 2014.\n “Obama vows response to ‘N Korea cyber attack’”, *Al Jazeera*, 19 Dec. 2014; “Sony hack: Obama vows response as FBI blames North Korea,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; “FBI director gives new clues tying North Korea to Sony hack,” *Associated Press*, 7 Jan. 2015; Alex Altman and Sam Frizell, “Hollywood Hacked: Why no company is immune,” *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 19.\n “North Korea refuses to deny Sony Pictures cyber-attack”, *BBC*, 1 Dec. 2014. When asked about its possible involvement in the hack, a spokesman at North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the UN in New York replied: “The hostile forces are relating everything to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I kindly advise you to just wait and see.”\n Madison Park and Dana Ford, “North Korea to U.S.: Show evidence we hacked Sony,” *CNN*, 14 Jan. 2015, reporting on the press briefing on 13 Jan. 2015 by North Korea’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, New York.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nSaddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction”. Adding to the confusion was a claim by the group named Lizard Squad which had repeatedly hacked Sony’s network in 2014. An alleged member of the Lizard Squad gave an interview claiming that the group had shared some login data stolen from Sony’s employees with the Guardians of Peace, thereby throwing some doubt on the theory that the North Korean Government was behind the Sony hack at all. There was also a possibility that the hack could have been contracted out by the North Korean Government to private hackers.\nOne of the lessons from this Sony hack episode, according to two experts on cybersecurity, is that attribution of cyberattacks is hard, “mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion”, not the court of law. The same could be said of: (a) the conclusion in 2013 by US cybersecurity firm Mandiant that the Chinese Government was behind one of the world’s prolific group of computer hackers since these hackers could be traced to a location near Shanghai in China which is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a signals intelligence division of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA); and (b) the report in September 2015 by ThreatConnect and Defense Group Inc. The latter based its attribution of the spyware and “phishing” attacks studied to a hacker collectively known as “Nikon” at a military intelligence unit of the PLA in Kunming, southern China. A member of the Chinese military was identified as the operator of a domain called “GreenSky27” from which the spyware and attacks originated, based on his profile, online activities, and academic publications.\nIndeed, no one has ever come up with conclusive, as opposed to circumstantial evidence, as to who hacked the White House in October 2014, JPMorgan, Nasdaq, and so forth. The 20 March 2013 cyberattack, known as “Dark Seoul”, paralyzed approximately 48,000 computers at several major banks and broadcasters in South Korea, disrupting network systems and deleting files in their hard disks. The cyber hack occurred not long after, owing to the growing tensions between the two Koreas, the North Korean Government had announced it would terminate the armistice agreement which had ended the Korean War in July 1953. On 23 December 2014, computers at South Korea’s nuclear operator were breached, with the hackers trying to steal data, including plant blueprints and personnel information, therefrom. South Korean investigators were reported to have said that they had proof that the hacking\n Dave Lee, “What is FBI evidence for North Korea hack attack?,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; Brian Todd and Ben Brumfield, “Experts doubt North Korea was behind the Sony hack”, CNN, 27 Dec. 2014.

In the case of the Sony hack, The New York Times alleged in January 2015 that in 2010 the NSA had “drilled into the Chinese networks that connect North Korea to the outside world, picked through connections in Malaysia favored by North Korean hackers and penetrated directly into the North with the help of South Korea and other American allies, according to former United States and foreign officials, computer experts later briefed on the operations and a newly disclosed NSA document … [and managed to] place malware that could track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by the North’s hackers”. According to the newspaper, it was the evidence gathered by the malware planted by the NSA to track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by North Korea’s hackers that convinced the US authorities that North Korea had been behind the Sony hack.\nSince 19 October 2015, Facebook notifies its users whenever it believes that their accounts have been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working for a nation State, so that the users can take security measures to secure their online accounts. This is when the attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others and when detailed analyses by Facebook’s own technical experts, taking into account victims’ reports, show strong indication of the involvement of States or State-sponsored entities or persons. Facebook thus follows Google which has taken a similar step since mid-2012. Microsoft has taken the same measure since 30 December 2015.\n## 2.2.1 ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility\nGuidance on attribution for the purpose of international law of State responsibility is to be sought from the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (2001), which has been relied extensively by the International Court of Justice to interpret international law in this matter.

The actions of non-State actors may also sometimes be attributable to States.”58\nChapter II of the ILC’s Draft Articles, entitled “Attribution of conduct to a State”, explains the rules as follows.\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails that State’s international responsibility.59 The State is treated as a unity, consistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. Therefore, the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. In this connection, a State organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.60 The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority is considered an act attributed to the State under international law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.61 If an organ is placed at the disposal of a State by another State, the conduct of such organ is considered an act of the former State under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the State at whose disposal it is placed.62 The conduct of such an organ of a State or a person or entity is considered an act attributed to the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.63\nBesides, the conduct of a person or group of persons is considered an act attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of that State in carrying out the conduct.64 A general situation of dependence on or support from a State is insufficient for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of the person or group of persons to the State – the State must be able to assert “effective control” over the\n\nRule 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States” (ibid., 26). However, there is no consensus as to whether this Rule also applies if the State has only constructive (“should have known”) knowledge or whether this Rule applies to States through which cyber operations are routed (ibid., p. 28). See also ibid., 34–36.\n\nconduct in question in the sense of the State’s actual participation of and directions given to the conduct. The International Court of Justice has affirmed that:\nState’s responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons — neither State organs nor to be equated with such organs — only if, assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful, they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in Article 8 [of the ILC’s Draft Articles mentioned above]. This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed...\nThis means the “effective control” must be exercised, or that the State’s instructions are given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations. The ICJ rejects the “overall control” test as “stretch[ing] too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”.\nThe US position regarding “proxy actors” in cyberspace is in line with the test just mentioned. According to the US,\nStates are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors”, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it. ...\nThe ILC’s Draft Articles also cover exceptional cases, such as during revolution, armed conflict or foreign occupation, where the regular authorities dissolve, are disintegrating, have been suppressed or are for the time being inoperative, as well as cases where lawful authority is being gradually restored, e.g., after foreign occupation. In these circumstances, the conduct of a person or group of persons is\n Para. (4), ILC Commentary to Art. 8 and para. (2), ILC Commentary to Art. 10 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (ILC Yearbook 2001, vol. II, Part Two, 47–48, 50).

USA), ICJ Rep. 1986, paras. 65, 109, 115.\n Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

However, where the movement achieves its aims and either installs itself as the new Government of the State or forms a new State in part of the territory of the pre-existing State or in a territory under its administration, its conduct is considered to be attributable to that State under international law, and the predecessor State will not be responsible for that conduct except in exceptional cases where the predecessor State was in a position to adopt measures of vigilance, prevention or punishment in respect of the movement’s conduct but improperly failed to do so and this has resulted in an injury or damage to another State.72\nWhere a State acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own, that conduct is considered an act of that State under international to the extent acknowledged and adopted as such by the State.73\nFinally, State A is internationally responsible for aiding or assisting State B in the commission of an international wrongful act by State B if State A does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and if the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by State A itself.74 This requires a close connection between the act of aiding or assisting and the eventual wrongful act of State B. The support must have a substantial effect in the sense of making it materially easier to commit the wrongful act which State A is obligated not to commit itself.75\nIn addition to responsibility for cyber activities attributed to a State, general international law imposes on every State the due diligence duty “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This rule has been laid down by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.76 The territorial State must exercise its due diligence duty as it can be reasonably expected to do so. Thus, a transit State where the Internet is routed through its territory or a developing State from where a cyber activity is launched can only be expected to take any action\n\nexpected of it when it becomes aware of the activity and only in accordance with its technological capability.\nAlthough the International Group of Experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual could not agree whether constructive knowledge sufficed to entail the due diligence duty, this present author believes that a State must, according to either its actual or constructive knowledge and in light of its technological capability, take measures as may be reasonably expected of it to prevent or stop its territory from being used by a cyberattacker to injure another State. However, it will take time for State practice to settle on what such reasonable measures actually are.\n## 2.2.2 Standard(s) of Proof\nIn apprehending cyber criminals, law enforcement authorities arrest suspects on the basis of evidence which must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt in a criminal court of law. In case of State responsibility, however, the accuser must prove that an unlawful cyber activity is “attributable” or “attributed” to a State using the applicable international legal standard explained in Sect. 2.2.1.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s Rule 7 (Cyber operations launched from governmental infrastructure) reads: “The mere fact that a cyber operation has been launched or otherwise originates from governmental cyber infrastructure is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State but is an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation”. Its Rule 8 (Cyber operations routed through a State) provides: “The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State.” The rules are sound, bearing in mind that the origin of the massive cyberattack on Estonia, of which Tallinn is its capital city, in April and May 2007 was traced back to 177 other States around the world!\n“Clear and compelling” information or evidence was cited by the US and NATO in support of their conclusion that Al-Qaeda was behind the 11 September 2001\n Michael N.

Venezuela)*, 10 *Reports of International Arbitral Awards* 499 (1903), 509–510, where the Italy-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission accepted the contention that a State was only obligated to accord protection to a foreign interest insofar as permitted by the means at that State’s disposal and according to the circumstances as they might be verified.\n The present author, therefore, concurs with Karine Bannelier-Christakis, “Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?,” *Baltic YBIL* 14 (2014): 23, 28–39.

On “proxy cyberattacks”, see Libicki, *Crisis*, 84–89.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nattacks on US soil. This standard is higher than that of “preponderance of the evidence” (i.e., “more likely than not”) in certain civil and administrative proceedings but lower than that of “beyond a reasonable doubt” in criminal law. The ICJ in *Oil Platform (Islamic Republic of Iran v. USA)* uses the terms “direct evidence”, which is not merely “suggestive”, and “conclusive” evidence. It is the State making the assertion which bears the burden of proof. In other cases, the ICJ refers to the need for “conclusive evidence”, “a degree of certainty”, “inferences of fact …[which] leave no room for reasonable doubt”, “degree of certainty … supported by convincing evidence”, “clear evidence”, “[relevant facts] convincingly established by the evidence”, “evidence [that is] weighty and convincing”, and “evidence that is fully conclusive”.\nOne veteran cyber threat analyst suggests some set of rules of thumb to prove attribution. Firstly, identify the architects of the malware by looking at a particular, identifying style of the malware. Secondly, consider the timing of the attack which may show the context in which the attack occurs. Thirdly, look at the victims to find out who would benefit from the attack. The analyst concludes, however, that in the end it comes down to a matter of speculation. Even when low-level, unsophisticated hacking against a group of persons opposed to the terrorist group operating under the name of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was discovered, it could not be confirmed that the hacking came from ISIL. Ironically, North Korea’s Internet was suddenly shut down for 9 h and 31 min on 22–23 December 2014 with no one claiming responsibility at that time, and it could not be proven then whether this was a counterattack by the US Government or by hacktivist groups like Anonymous which had targeted North\n Letter dated 7 Oct. 2001 from the Permanent Rep. of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N.

Only in July 2015 did the Director of the NSA and Commander of the US Cyber Command disclose to the public that he had advised the US President to retaliate against North Korea for the Sony hack.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that in the context of measures of unilateral self-help, the reality is that States must make unilateral ex ante determinations with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State before responding and that such determinations may be subject to post factum review of the applicable burden of proof. States are, thus, expected to act as reasonable States objectively would in same or similar circumstances, taking into due consideration such cumulative factors as the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the evidence when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.\nOne learned author argues that the test of proving attribution for the purpose of State responsibility as explained above is out of touch with cyber reality. According to this view, “attribution asymmetry” in cyberspace makes it more difficult for the victim State to trace cyberattacks from non-State actors who are assisted by a State, while making it easier for the State behind the cyberattacks to control such attacks. This, arguably, provides an incentive for the victim State to resort to using non-State actors to counterattack the State it suspects to be behind an initial attack. A test focusing on “virtual control” is proposed instead, with the burden shifting to a State to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyberattack when that State funds and equips a non-State actor who subsequently launch a cyberattack – this is because the funding/equipping State has greater access to the relevant information concerning possible attribution of responsibility than the victim State does. It would also establish a rebuttable presumption that when State infrastructure is used for a cyberattack, the State owning the infrastructure is responsible. The new test would also help ensure that the State exercise due diligence not to allow its territory, infrastructure, equipment, or funding to be used for a cyberattack against another State – and if it fails to be duly diligent this would entail State responsibility. The new test would draw upon the ICJ’s reasoning in Nicaragua v. USA where the ICJ noted that the contras continued to fight in Nicaragua even after the US Government had ended its funding to the group on 1 October 1984; hence, a rebuttable presumption that, subject to evidence to the contrary, the US was no longer in control of the contras. Disassociation from non-State actors suspected of launching a cyberattack\n Jo Biddle, “N.

Judgment in Tadic (Case No. IT-94-1-A, 15 Jul 1999) that the continuing salary payment by the Rep. of Yugoslavia to an armed group did indicate control of the group by the Rep. of Yugoslavia.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nalso shows the good faith on the part of the disassociating State. It could take years to see if this proposed new test will be endorsed by State practice in relation to cyberspace. In the meantime, all the factors cited in support of the proposed new test can be taken into consideration in determining whether a cyber activity is attributable to a State pursuant to the existing international law of State responsibility.\nPresently, we may sometimes see the different positions/standards on attribution adopted by intelligence agencies, on the one hand, and law enforcement agencies, on the other hand. The former assess information and evidence, including circumstantial evidence and undisclosed human intelligence, to substantiate their suspicion that an entity or person is behind a cyberattack. The latter usually needs evidence that can stand up in courts of law before they can conclude who is the perpetrator of a cyberattack. This should explain the position taken by the US intelligence agencies and the initial one taken by the FBI, a US national law enforcement agency, in the aftermath of the allegations that a foreign State was behind cyber activities to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016.\nIn international relations, it is diplomatically wise and legally permissible to respond to an offensive act by another State commensurate with the level of certainty that the other State is behind the act: the more certain the evidence is, the more severe the response can be, provided that the response does not exceed the permissible bounds of international law. This will be explained in Sect. 4.7 below.\n## 2.2.3 Attribution and International Organizations, Such As NATO\nIn 2011, the ILC finished its work on the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (DARIOs), which closely follow the ILC’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n Libicki, Crisis, 22–23. For a similar argument, see, Constantine Antonopoulos, “State Responsibility in Cyberspace,” in Research Handbook, eds., Tsagourias and Buchan, 30–54.\n Sam Biddle, “Here’s the Public Evidence Russia Hacked the DNC – It’s Not Enough”, Intercept, 14 Dec. 2016; Kevin Johnson, “FBI accepts CIA conclusion that Russians hacked to help Trump”, USA Today, 16 Dec. 2016.\nDisclosure: As of this writing, the present author was an ambassador to the Russian Federation and was, therefore, bound by diplomatic etiquette not to comment on his host State’s relations with a third State. Readers are invited to judge by themselves whether the evidence revealed by the US Government met the international law standard(s) of proof explained in this Sect. 2.2.2.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, for example, is an organization where “the fundamental internal rule governing the functioning of the organization – that of consensus decision-making – is to be found neither in the treaties establishing NATO nor in any formal rules and is, rather, the result of the practice of the organization”.\nIn Behrami and Saramati, the European Court of Human Rights rules that as the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) led by NATO acted on the authorization of the UN Security Council, the acts complained against UNMIK and KFOR were attributable to the United Nations. However, the Grand Chamber of the same Court rules in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom that the UN Security Council “had neither effective control nor ultimate authority and control over the acts and omissions of foreign troops within the Multi-National Force [in Iraq] and that the applicant’s detention was not, therefore, attributable to the United Nations”; hence, the detention complained of in that case had to be attributed to the State detaining the complainant.\nAttributing to an international organization ultra vires acts taken by its organ takes is supported by international jurisprudence and practice of international organizations as well as policy considerations that “denying attribution of conduct may deprive third parties of all redresses, unless conduct could be attributable to a State or another organization”. Draft Article 9 of DARIOs also makes it clear that conduct which is not otherwise attributable to an international organization shall nevertheless be considered an act of that organization under international law if and to the extent that the organization acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\nthe 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 26 Oct. 2011 (Doc.

Such jurisdiction is based on territoriality, passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace that spans the land, sea, air and outer space domains. In order to hold a State responsible for a cyber activity, that activity must be attributed to the State in accordance with international rules on attribution for the purpose of responsibility, including the applicable standard of proof. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the controversy surrounding alleged foreign interference by cyber means in the 2016 US Presidential election show the difficult challenges for the application of these rules. International organizations can be held accountable for cyber activities attributable to them, too.\nKeywords Jurisdiction in cyberspace • Attribution in cyberspace • State responsibility for cyber activities • 2014 Sony Pictures hacks and international law • Attribution for the 2016 US Presidential election hacks\n## 2.1 Jurisdiction¹\nWhile no State may claim sovereignty over cyberspace as such, States may exercise sovereign prerogatives over any cyber infrastructure situated on their territory as well as activities associated with that cyber infrastructure.² Such prerogatives\n¹ See, generally, Secretariat of the International Law Commission, *Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of the Fifty-eighth Session* (2006), UN Gen.

There is also an adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts of the State to interpret its law and regulations.³\nJurisdiction is primarily territorial. A State may exercise jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure and over the intangible based on territoriality, including “subjective territorial jurisdiction” over an incident originating in a State’s territory but consummated elsewhere, and “objective territorial jurisdiction” over individuals where an incident has effects on the State’s territory although the act was initiated elsewhere.⁴ This territorial jurisdiction extends to the airspace superjacent to the land territory and territorial waters under the State’s sovereignty.⁵ For example, a State has jurisdiction over civilian aircraft with airborne cyber infrastructure to hack into Wi-Fi networks or eavesdrop on cell phone calls and text messages and to exfiltrate or otherwise interfere with data in the State’s territory being overflown and may order the aircraft to land to submit to the jurisdiction of the territorial State for violation of its law.⁶ In case of State aircraft, they must get prior authorization from the territorial State over which they intend to overfly, and the authorization may comprise conditions,⁷ violation of which entitles the territorial State to demand that the aircraft in question cease the violation and depart its airspace without delay, and, if the aircraft refuses, to take necessary and proportional measures against that aircraft.⁸\npersons coordinated by Prof. M.

The second part of the Tallinn Manual entitled Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017) was written by another group of experts including the present author of this book in 2015–2016 and will be hereinafter referred to as Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n“Cyber infrastructure” is defined as “the communication, storage, and computing resources upon which information systems operate” (Tallinn Manual, 15).\n³ Marko Milanovic, *Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 23–25.

Several States have also asserted jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender’s victim is a national of that State – this is based on the passive personality principle of jurisdiction. Three judges of the ICJ noted in February 2002 that passive personality jurisdiction, which was previously regarded as controversial, is now reflected in the legislation of various States including the US and France “and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so far as a particular category of offences is concerned”.¹⁰ The more serious the offences, the less likely that opposition to the exercise of passive personality jurisdiction will face. Passive personality jurisdiction is an option in, for example, the 1970 Hague Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 1985 Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture; the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance; the 1997 Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; the 1999 Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; the 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the 2006 Enforced Disappearance Convention; and the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism.\nA State may, based on the protective principle, exercise jurisdiction over the offender whose conduct abroad threatens that State’s security or interferes with the operation of its government functions.¹¹\nThe most controversial base of jurisdiction is universal jurisdiction, whereby a State asserts jurisdiction over a crime which has no connection (nexus) with that State at all. In other words, the crime is committed outside its territory, does not have any effect therein, and neither the perpetrator nor the victim is its national. It has long been accepted that every State may exercise universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of piracy. Apart from that, it is still controversial whether a State may exercise universal jurisdiction absent treaty obligations binding on the States concerned – as in the case of the obligation to prosecute or extradite commonly found\n⁹See further, Henrik Spang-Hanssen, Cyberspace &amp; International Law on Jurisdiction (Copenhagen: DJØF Publishing, 2004), chaps. 31, 32; Tallinn Manual, 18.\n¹⁰Para. 47 of the Joint Separate Opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal, Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Dem.

The processing in cloud computing may occur in several States simultaneously. It is submitted that in this type of situation more than one State have concurrent jurisdiction over a crime committed via cloud computing, pursuant to any one of jurisdictional bases mentioned above insofar as it is applicable to the facts in question.\nCurrently, fibre-optic cables buried in the seabed are the main conduits of the Internet since satellites have limited capacity compared to cables and are, thus, much more expensive and their use is confined mainly to broadcasting as well as for Internet usage by communities in very remote regions.²¹\nA State has sovereignty over communication cables lying within its land territory, internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It can adopt laws and regulations to protect submarine cables in its territorial sea, for example.²² To accommodate the interest of existing submarine cables, the law of the sea as codified in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS) requires an archipelagic State, which is recognized pursuant to UNCLOS, to respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. In addition, an archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them.²³ In the maritime area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea called the “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State is measured, all States generally enjoy the freedom of the laying of submarine cables, with due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS and other rules of international law insofar as they are not incompatible therewith.²⁴ This freedom is permissible as it is not an exercise of sovereign rights over the natural resources which is reserved exclusively for the coastal State in whose EEZ the laying of submarine cables takes place.²⁵\n¹⁹ Nancy J.

All States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the continental shelf of another State. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables. The coastal State may set conditions for cables entering its land territory, internal waters or territorial sea. The coastal State also has jurisdiction over cables constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. When laying submarine cables, States are required to have due regard to cables already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables shall not be prejudiced.\nInternational law is silent as to whether and to what extent such cables are subject to the jurisdiction of the States that own them or whose nationals have laid and operate them. In particular, it is doubtful whether these States may take the measures necessary to protect their cables against malicious interference. Marine cables protection zones are permitted in the territorial sea, by virtue of Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS, but not in maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the case of submarine cables lying beyond the territorial sea, Article 113 of UNCLOS requires every State to criminalize their breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications. The provision predated the age of the Internet. Nevertheless, as fibre-optic cables are used in telecommunication that includes telephonic communications, the cables are covered under this UNCLOS provision. This provision applies also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, but it does not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury. Article 114 of UNCLOS requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable, cause a break in or injury to another cable, they shall bear the cost of the repairs. Article 115 requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.\nBesides UNCLOS, the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, in force since 1 May 1888, regulates interference with telegraph cables outside territorial waters of its Parties. It accords the competent jurisdiction to the court of the State in which the vessel in question is registered (“flag State”) and the State of nationality of the offender, in that order. The Convention makes it a punishable offence to break or injure a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages. This provision does not apply to cases where those who break or injure a cable do so with the lawful object of saving their lives or their ship, after they have taken every necessary precaution to avoid so breaking or injuring the cable. There are merely 41 States Parties to the 1884 Convention, though.\nWith regard to unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, Article 109 of UNCLOS requires all States to cooperate in its suppression. “Unauthorized broadcasting” is defined as “the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls”. This provision predated the era of the Internet, and one may question whether it covers transmission by cyber means. It is hereby submitted that if there is some cyber involvement in transmitting sound radio or television broadcast such as using cyber-facilitated means to stream radio and television via the Internet or to disseminate information, especially through social media platforms such as Twitter, vk.com, Facebook, this definition of broadcasting can be interpreted to cover transmission via the Internet. This present author agrees with the position of the majority of the experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the object and purpose of proscribing unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas are primarily the prevention of interference with broadcasting that is not in compliance with international regulations, such as the regulation of broadcasting frequencies, and produces negative effects on maritime or air communications. The posting of online material, including online propaganda, from the high seas poses no such risks and is not covered by this prohibition -- there is no difference whether online material is posted from a vessel in the high seas or on land. The following provisions on unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas must be understood in this context.\nArticle 109 of UNCLOS provides that any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas may be prosecuted before the court of: (a) the flag State of the ship from which the broadcast is made; (b) the State of registry of the installation from which the broadcast is made; (c) the State of which the person is a national; (d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or (e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference. The State having the said jurisdiction may, in conformity with Article 110 of UNCLOS, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus. Article 110 stipulates that, except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign\nship, other than a warship or a ship owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service, may board it if there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the foreign ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109; the foreign ship is without nationality; or though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship. Article 110 applies mutatis mutandis to military aircraft as well as to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service which encounter the suspected ship.\nUNCLOS is supplemented by other international instruments in this matter. For example, the 1965 European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations Outside National Territories regulates broadcasting stations which are installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other floating or airborne objects and which, outside national territories, transmit broadcasts intended for reception or capable of being received, wholly or in part, within the territory of any Contracting Party, or which cause harmful interference to any radio-communication service operating under the authority of a Contracting Party in accordance with the Radio Regulations. Each Contracting Party undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of the said broadcasting, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, apply the provisions of this Agreement in regard to its nationals who have committed any of the aforesaid offences on its territory, ships, or aircraft, or outside national territories on any ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne object; and non-nationals who, on its territory, ships or aircraft, or on board any floating or airborne object under its jurisdiction have committed any of such acts. The Agreement implements the said Radio Regulations, annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, which prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories. The Regulations define broadcasting stations as those in the “broadcasting service”, which is itself defined as a radio-communication service of transmissions to be received directly by the general public, including transmissions of sounds or transmissions by television, facsimile or other means. The term “other means” is broad enough to cover the Internet and other cyber-facilitated means of broadcasting.\nWith regard to the right of visit in the high seas, Article 110 of UNCLOS authorizes warships or other duly authorized vessels or aircraft to board a foreign vessel encountered on the high seas which is not a foreign warship or vessel owned or operated by a foreign State and used only on government non-commercial service when there is a “reasonable ground for suspecting” it is engaged in piracy, slave trading or unauthorized broadcasting, appears to be without nationality, or is of the nationality of the visiting vessel but appears to be disguising its nationality. However, the International Group of Experts writing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were split as to\n2.1 Jurisdiction\nwhether the right of visit includes the right of “virtual visit”, for example, by using cyber means to verify the nationality of the vessel concerned by monitoring its communications, and inspect its cyber infrastructure remotely when suspicion remains that the vessel is engaged in any of the aforesaid proscribed activities.²⁹ This present author submits that it does so include.\nIn a near future, global Internet access from satellites, akin to rebuilding the Internet in space, may become a real possibility.³⁰ The draftsmen of the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime considered it unnecessary to establish jurisdiction over offences involving satellites registered in the name of a State, because unlawful communications by satellites originated from and/or was received on earth, and the satellites were mere mediums of transmission.³¹ This perception may need to be reconsidered in light of the report that nation-State hackers have, since 2007, used a Digital Video Broadband satellite provider covering the Middle East and Africa to hide the actual location and activities of advanced persistent threat (APT) from the “Turla” malware attack. Latching onto unencrypted connections between active IP addresses and satellites to route the traffic to an unused port disguised as the legitimate IP of the user makes the APTs almost impossible to shut down because the cyber infrastructure hosting the cyberattack is not traceable. Although satellite communications usually provide slow and frequently unstable speeds, this cyberattack method is relatively inexpensive to implement, at the cost of initial investment of less than US$1000 and regular maintenance of less than US$1000 per year.³² Google, an important Internet Service Provider (ISP), has “Project Loon” which launches balloons into the stratospheres, at least 20 km (12 miles) above the earth surface, to beam Internet access to users beneath the balloons’ path.³³ Internet connectivity on board an aircraft is now made possible via an antenna on the aircraft’s fuselage which exchanges signals to and from the ground through the nearest satellite in a chain of geostationary satellites situated around the equator approximately 36,000 km above the earth.³⁴ Space law, thus, becomes relevant to the use of cyberspace.\nArticle VIII of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial\n²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, chap. 8 Law of the sea.\n³⁰ “SpaceX chief Musk eyes Internet satellites: report,” China Post, 12 Nov. 2014, 6; Melody Peterson, “Google may invest in SpaceX to back Elon Musk’s satellite project,” Los Angeles Times, 19 Jan. 2015; “SpaceX aims to launch internet from space”, BBC, 17 Nov. 2016.\n³¹ Explanatory Report of 8 Nov. 2001 to the convention adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, para. 234, cited in Spang-Hanssen, Public International Computer Network Law Issues, 318.\n³² Dan Worth, “Turla APT malware threat uses satellites to avoid detection,” Security, 9 Sept. 2015, reporting on the finding of Kaspersky Lab.

Of course, this is subject to other permissible bases of jurisdiction exercisable by other States as explained above. Article III of the Treaty stipulates that space activities are to be carried out “in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding”. They must also be for peaceful purposes,³⁶ but this does not preclude the right to exercise self-defence in outer space or by employing space-based assets to defend against armed attacks launched from outer space against targets on earth.³⁷\n## 2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\nActors in cyberspace are States, individuals, other non-State actors, and their proxies.³⁸ There are problems in attributing a cyber activity to any specific person or entity, especially in light of the anonymity of the author of that activity whose identification depends on the ability of the interested party to verify, or back trace, that author.\nSuch anonymity may be achieved in several ways. Virtual private networking (VPN) tunnels the entire network traffic which is encrypted between the start (“client”) and the endpoint (“server”) located elsewhere before data is transmitted to the resource that the user is actually trying to access. Another method is using proxy servers which allow users to hide their IP address by tunnelling all specific types of traffic through another server, and the accessed host need not be a web server. Yet another method is the use of anonymous networks with the “onion routing” technique, utilizing multiple public or private proxy servers to relay encrypted data across many randomly chosen nodes on the anonymity network with multiple layers of encryption applied to the transmitted data, and each relay node decrypting the following layer until the original data is revealed and sent to the intended recipient. Another method involves infecting the computer of another person with malware so that the person planting the malware can control that computer in order to undertake\n³⁵ United Kingdom Treaty Ser.

Finally, users may conceal their personal information or identities to remain anonymous online.³⁹\nIt may be possible to validate the origin of data and verify the sender’s digital signature through a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) which validates a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication, but this is not popularly used.⁴⁰\nFor the purpose of attribution in cyberspace, one must identify the originating source of communication by going over the route by which the communication has come, the person/entity behind it, and whether that person/entity is directed or controlled by another person/entity or a State.\nBack-tracing or back-tracking is the most common method to identify the afore-said point of departure. This includes locating the IP address or addresses, determining the point of contact, and luring the hacker into revealing more details about his/its identity. The more proficient the hacker is, the less successful the back-tracing becomes.⁴¹ However, some types of data that can be collected are relatively difficult to hide and the patterns of how a person browses and clicks through a website may lead to his/its identity.⁴²\nEven where a cyberattack has no international connection, law enforcement authorities not infrequently run into difficulties in apprehending the right perpetrator. In Japan, for example, in 2012 a hacker named Yusuke Katayama (a.k.a. Demon Killer) infected computers belonging to strangers with a Trojan Horse virus and then sent death threats from these computers. Several persons who owned the computers remotely controlled by Katayama were wrongly arrested and subsequently exonerated. Only after Katayama had made an error by sending a riddle containing information that could only have been known by the real perpetrator of the death threats were the police able to identify and arrest him. The police were told by a message to look for a cat at a specific location. The cat was wearing a collar on which was a memory card with details of the code and malicious programme Katayama had used to gain remote control of his victims’ computers. The cat was seen with Katayama on CCTV footage, leading to his arrest in February 2013.⁴³\nThe hackers of the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system in November and December 2014 did not connect directly to Sony’s network, but attacked it by connecting through one or more relay computers at different locations (or using the “stepping stone” systems) in order to hide their actual location.

The hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace (GoP) made threats against cinemas intending to show the film *The Interview*, a comedy produced by Sony about the assassination of North Korea’s Head of State, and their audiences. On 1 December 2014, the FBI issued a five-page confidential warning to US businesses in general that cyber hackers had used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US, making it impossible to recover any lost data. It gave some technical details about the malware and the advice on how to deal with such an attack.⁴⁵\nSubsequently, the FBI attributed the Sony hack to North Korea on the grounds that: (a) the malware used in the hack had “clear links” to malware developed by North Korea which had been used in a cyberattack in March 2014 against South Korean banks and media outlets, and had been traced to an IP address in Pyongyang, North Korea; (b) the tools used in the said Sony attack had “similarities” to the ones developed by North Korea in specific lines of computer code, encryption algorithms, and data deletion methods; and (c) the statements and threats in connection with the Sony attacks were similar in terms of behaviour to other known attacks by the North Koreans.⁴⁶ The North Korean Government itself initially refused to deny that it was behind the Sony hack,⁴⁷ but subsequently denied it outright and challenged the US to provide evidence to substantiate any allegation that North Korea was the culprit.⁴⁸\nThe FBI’s attribution was not free from criticisms. Skeptics contended that the FBI was very careful not to allege that the attack was controlled from within North Korea. It was also doubted whether a nation State like North Korea could have acted alone without assistance from outside.

An alleged member of the Lizard Squad gave an interview claiming that the group had shared some login data stolen from Sony’s employees with the Guardians of Peace, thereby throwing some doubt on the theory that the North Korean Government was behind the Sony hack at all. There was also a possibility that the hack could have been contracted out by the North Korean Government to private hackers.⁵⁰\nOne of the lessons from this Sony hack episode, according to two experts on cybersecurity, is that attribution of cyberattacks is hard, “mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion”, not the court of law.⁵¹ The same could be said of: (a) the conclusion in 2013 by US cybersecurity firm Mandiant that the Chinese Government was behind one of the world’s prolific group of computer hackers since these hackers could be traced to a location near Shanghai in China which is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a signals intelligence division of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA); and (b) the report in September 2015 by ThreatConnect and Defense Group Inc.⁵² The latter based its attribution of the spyware and “phishing” attacks studied to a hacker collectively known as “Nikon” at a military intelligence unit of the PLA in Kunming, southern China. A member of the Chinese military was identified as the operator of a domain called “GreenSky27” from which the spyware and attacks originated, based on his profile, online activities, and academic publications.\nIndeed, no one has ever come up with conclusive, as opposed to circumstantial evidence, as to who hacked the White House in October 2014, JPMorgan, Nasdaq, and so forth. The 20 March 2013 cyberattack, known as “Dark Seoul”, paralyzed approximately 48,000 computers at several major banks and broadcasters in South Korea, disrupting network systems and deleting files in their hard disks. The cyber hack occurred not long after, owing to the growing tensions between the two Koreas, the North Korean Government had announced it would terminate the armistice agreement which had ended the Korean War in July 1953. On 23 December 2014, computers at South Korea’s nuclear operator were breached, with the hackers trying to steal data, including plant blueprints and personnel information, therefrom. South Korean investigators were reported to have said that they had proof that the hacking\n⁴⁹ Dave Lee, “What is FBI evidence for North Korea hack attack?,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; Brian Todd and Ben Brumfield, “Experts doubt North Korea was behind the Sony hack”, CNN, 27 Dec. 2014.

According to the newspaper, it was the evidence gathered by the malware planted by the NSA to track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by North Korea’s hackers that convinced the US authorities that North Korea had been behind the Sony hack.⁵⁴\nSince 19 October 2015, Facebook notifies its users whenever it believes that their accounts have been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working for a nation State, so that the users can take security measures to secure their online accounts. This is when the attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others and when detailed analyses by Facebook’s own technical experts, taking into account victims’ reports, show strong indication of the involvement of States or State-sponsored entities or persons.

The actions of non-State actors may also sometimes be attributable to States.”58\nChapter II of the ILC’s Draft Articles, entitled “Attribution of conduct to a State”, explains the rules as follows.\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails that State’s international responsibility.59 The State is treated as a unity, consistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. Therefore, the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. In this connection, a State organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.60 The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority is considered an act attributed to the State under international law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.61 If an organ is placed at the disposal of a State by another State, the conduct of such organ is considered an act of the former State under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the State at whose disposal it is placed.62 The conduct of such an organ of a State or a person or entity is considered an act attributed to the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.63\nBesides, the conduct of a person or group of persons is considered an act attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of that State in carrying out the conduct.64 A general situation of dependence on or support from a State is insufficient for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of the person or group of persons to the State – the State must be able to assert “effective control” over the\n58 Tallinn Manual, 15. See also Rule 6 (Legal responsibility of States) of the Tallinn Manual at 29–34.\nRule 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States” (ibid., 26). However, there is no consensus as to whether this Rule also applies if the State has only constructive (“should have known”) knowledge or whether this Rule applies to States through which cyber operations are routed (ibid., p. 28). See also ibid., 34–36.\n59 Art. 1 Responsibility of a State for its internationally wrongful acts.\n60 Art. 4 Conduct of organs of a State.\n61 Art. 5 Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of government authority.\n62 Art. 6 Conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State.\n63 Art. 7 Excess of authority or contravention of instructions.\n64 Art. 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State.\n2 Jurisdiction and Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace\nconduct in question in the sense of the State’s actual participation of and directions given to the conduct.⁶⁵ The International Court of Justice has affirmed that:\nState’s responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons — neither State organs nor to be equated with such organs — only if, assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful, they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in Article 8 [of the ILC’s Draft Articles mentioned above]. This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed...⁶⁶\nThis means the “effective control” must be exercised, or that the State’s instructions are given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.⁶⁷ The ICJ rejects the “overall control” test as “stretch[ing] too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”.⁶⁸\nThe US position regarding “proxy actors” in cyberspace is in line with the test just mentioned. According to the US,\nStates are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors”, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it. ...⁶⁹\nThe ILC’s Draft Articles also cover exceptional cases, such as during revolution, armed conflict or foreign occupation, where the regular authorities dissolve, are disintegrating, have been suppressed or are for the time being inoperative, as well as cases where lawful authority is being gradually restored, e.g., after foreign occupation. In these circumstances, the conduct of a person or group of persons is\n⁶⁵ Para. (4), ILC Commentary to Art. 8 and para.

USA), ICJ Rep. 1986, paras. 65, 109, 115.\n⁶⁶ Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

However, where the movement achieves its aims and either installs itself as the new Government of the State or forms a new State in part of the territory of the pre-existing State or in a territory under its administration, its conduct is considered to be attributable to that State under international law, and the predecessor State will not be responsible for that conduct except in exceptional cases where the predecessor State was in a position to adopt measures of vigilance, prevention or punishment in respect of the movement’s conduct but improperly failed to do so and this has resulted in an injury or damage to another State.72\nWhere a State acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own, that conduct is considered an act of that State under international to the extent acknowledged and adopted as such by the State.73\nFinally, State A is internationally responsible for aiding or assisting State B in the commission of an international wrongful act by State B if State A does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and if the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by State A itself.74 This requires a close connection between the act of aiding or assisting and the eventual wrongful act of State B. The support must have a substantial effect in the sense of making it materially easier to commit the wrongful act which State A is obligated not to commit itself.75\nIn addition to responsibility for cyber activities attributed to a State, general international law imposes on every State the due diligence duty “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This rule has been laid down by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.76 The territorial State must exercise its due diligence duty as it can be reasonably expected to do so. Thus, a transit State where the Internet is routed through its territory or a developing State from where a cyber activity is launched can only be expected to take any action\n70 Art. 9 Conduct carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities.\n71 Para. 3 of the Commentary to Draft Art. 9, citing the ruling of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in Kenneth P.

In case of State responsibility, however, the accuser must prove that an unlawful cyber activity is “attributable” or “attributed” to a State using the applicable international legal standard explained in Sect. 2.2.1.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s Rule 7 (Cyber operations launched from governmental infrastructure) reads: “The mere fact that a cyber operation has been launched or otherwise originates from governmental cyber infrastructure is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State but is an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation”. Its Rule 8 (Cyber operations routed through a State) provides: “The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State.” The rules are sound, bearing in mind that the origin of the massive cyberattack on Estonia, of which Tallinn is its capital city, in April and May 2007 was traced back to 177 other States around the world!⁷⁹\n“Clear and compelling” information or evidence was cited by the US and NATO in support of their conclusion that Al-Qaeda was behind the 11 September 2001\n⁷⁷ Michael N.

USA)* uses the terms “direct evidence”, which is not merely “suggestive”, and “conclusive” evidence. It is the State making the assertion which bears the burden of proof.⁸² In other cases, the ICJ refers to the need for “conclusive evidence”,⁸³ “a degree of certainty”,⁸⁴ “inferences of fact …[which] leave no room for reasonable doubt”,⁸⁵ “degree of certainty … supported by convincing evidence”,⁸⁶ “clear evidence”,⁸⁷ “[relevant facts] convincingly established by the evidence”,⁸⁸ “evidence [that is] weighty and convincing”,⁸⁹ and “evidence that is fully conclusive”.⁹⁰\nOne veteran cyber threat analyst suggests some set of rules of thumb to prove attribution. Firstly, identify the architects of the malware by looking at a particular, identifying style of the malware. Secondly, consider the timing of the attack which may show the context in which the attack occurs. Thirdly, look at the victims to find out who would benefit from the attack. The analyst concludes, however, that in the end it comes down to a matter of speculation.⁹¹ Even when low-level, unsophisticated hacking against a group of persons opposed to the terrorist group operating under the name of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was discovered, it could not be confirmed that the hacking came from ISIL.⁹² Ironically, North Korea’s Internet was suddenly shut down for 9 h and 31 min on 22–23 December 2014 with no one claiming responsibility at that time, and it could not be proven then whether this was a counterattack by the US Government or by hacktivist groups like Anonymous which had targeted North\n⁸⁰ Letter dated 7 Oct. 2001 from the Permanent Rep. of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N.

States are, thus, expected to act as reasonable States objectively would in same or similar circumstances, taking into due consideration such cumulative factors as the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the evidence when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.⁹⁵\nOne learned author argues that the test of proving attribution for the purpose of State responsibility as explained above is out of touch with cyber reality. According to this view, “attribution asymmetry” in cyberspace makes it more difficult for the victim State to trace cyberattacks from non-State actors who are assisted by a State, while making it easier for the State behind the cyberattacks to control such attacks. This, arguably, provides an incentive for the victim State to resort to using non-State actors to counterattack the State it suspects to be behind an initial attack. A test focusing on “virtual control” is proposed instead, with the burden shifting to a State to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyberattack when that State funds and equips a non-State actor who subsequently launch a cyberattack – this is because the funding/equipping State has greater access to the relevant information concerning possible attribution of responsibility than the victim State does.⁹⁶ It would also establish a rebuttable presumption that when State infrastructure is used for a cyberattack, the State owning the infrastructure is responsible. The new test would also help ensure that the State exercise due diligence not to allow its territory, infrastructure, equipment, or funding to be used for a cyberattack against another State – and if it fails to be duly diligent this would entail State responsibility. The new test would draw upon the ICJ’s reasoning in Nicaragua v. USA where the ICJ noted that the contras continued to fight in Nicaragua even after the US Government had ended its funding to the group on 1 October 1984; hence, a rebuttable presumption that, subject to evidence to the contrary, the US was no longer in control of the contras.⁹⁷ Disassociation from non-State actors suspected of launching a cyberattack\n⁹³ Jo Biddle, “N.

In the meantime, all the factors cited in support of the proposed new test can be taken into consideration in determining whether a cyber activity is attributable to a State pursuant to the existing international law of State responsibility.\nPresently, we may sometimes see the different positions/standards on attribution adopted by intelligence agencies, on the one hand, and law enforcement agencies, on the other hand. The former assess information and evidence, including circumstantial evidence and undisclosed human intelligence, to substantiate their suspicion that an entity or person is behind a cyberattack. The latter usually needs evidence that can stand up in courts of law before they can conclude who is the perpetrator of a cyberattack. This should explain the position taken by the US intelligence agencies and the initial one taken by the FBI, a US national law enforcement agency, in the aftermath of the allegations that a foreign State was behind cyber activities to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016.⁹⁹\nIn international relations, it is diplomatically wise and legally permissible to respond to an offensive act by another State commensurate with the level of certainty that the other State is behind the act: the more certain the evidence is, the more severe the response can be, provided that the response does not exceed the permissible bounds of international law. This will be explained in Sect. 4.7 below.\n## 2.2.3 Attribution and International Organizations, Such As NATO\nIn 2011, the ILC finished its work on the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (DARIOs),¹⁰⁰ which closely follow the ILC’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n⁹⁸ Libicki, Crisis, 22–23.

Readers are invited to judge by themselves whether the evidence revealed by the US Government met the international law standard(s) of proof explained in this Sect. 2.2.2.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, for example, is an organization where “the fundamental internal rule governing the functioning of the organization – that of consensus decision-making – is to be found neither in the treaties establishing NATO nor in any formal rules and is, rather, the result of the practice of the organization”.¹⁰¹\nIn Behrami and Saramati, the European Court of Human Rights rules that as the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) led by NATO acted on the authorization of the UN Security Council, the acts complained against UNMIK and KFOR were attributable to the United Nations.¹⁰² However, the Grand Chamber of the same Court rules in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom that the UN Security Council “had neither effective control nor ultimate authority and control over the acts and omissions of foreign troops within the Multi-National Force [in Iraq] and that the applicant’s detention was not, therefore, attributable to the United Nations”; hence, the detention complained of in that case had to be attributed to the State detaining the complainant.¹⁰³\nAttributing to an international organization ultra vires acts taken by its organ takes is supported by international jurisprudence and practice of international organizations as well as policy considerations that “denying attribution of conduct may deprive third parties of all redresses, unless conduct could be attributable to a State or another organization”.¹⁰⁴ Draft Article 9 of DARIOs also makes it clear that conduct which is not otherwise attributable to an international organization shall nevertheless be considered an act of that organization under international law if and to the extent that the organization acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\nthe 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 26 Oct. 2011 (Doc.

Such jurisdiction is based on territoriality, passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace that spans the land, sea, air and outer space domains. In order to hold a State responsible for a cyber activity, that activity must be attributed to the State in accordance with international rules on attribution for the purpose of responsibility, including the applicable standard of proof. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the controversy surrounding alleged foreign interference by cyber means in the 2016 US Presidential election show the difficult challenges for the application of these rules. International organizations can be held accountable for cyber activities attributable to them, too.\nKeywords Jurisdiction in cyberspace • Attribution in cyberspace • State responsibility for cyber activities • 2014 Sony Pictures hacks and international law • Attribution for the 2016 US Presidential election hacks\n## 2.1 Jurisdiction¹\nWhile no State may claim sovereignty over cyberspace as such, States may exercise sovereign prerogatives over any cyber infrastructure situated on their territory as well as activities associated with that cyber infrastructure.² Such prerogatives\n¹ See, generally, Secretariat of the International Law Commission, *Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of the Fifty-eighth Session* (2006), UN Gen.

Jurisdiction to prescribe is the State's authority to legislate or prescribe law and regulations. Jurisdiction to enforce is the State's authority to enforce the law and regulations legislated or prescribed by it. There is also an adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts of the State to interpret its law and regulations.³ Jurisdiction is primarily territorial. A State may exercise jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure and over the intangible based on territoriality, including “subjective territorial jurisdiction” over an incident originating in a State’s territory but consummated elsewhere, and “objective territorial jurisdiction” over individuals where an incident has effects on the State’s territory although the act was initiated elsewhere.⁴ This territorial jurisdiction extends to the airspace superjacent to the land territory and territorial waters under the State’s sovereignty.⁵ For example, a State has jurisdiction over civilian aircraft with airborne cyber infrastructure to hack into Wi-Fi networks or eavesdrop on cell phone calls and text messages and to exfiltrate or otherwise interfere with data in the State’s territory being overflown and may order the aircraft to land to submit to the jurisdiction of the territorial State for violation of its law.⁶ In case of State aircraft, they must get prior authorization from the territorial State over which they intend to overfly, and the authorization may comprise conditions,⁷ violation of which entitles the territorial State to demand that the aircraft in question cease the violation and depart its airspace without delay, and, if the aircraft refuses, to take necessary and proportional measures against that aircraft.⁸ persons coordinated by Prof. M. N. Schmitt, Chairman of the International Law Department at the United States Naval War College, at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The second part of the Tallinn Manual entitled Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017) was written by another group of experts including the present author of this book in 2015–2016 and will be hereinafter referred to as Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n“Cyber infrastructure” is defined as “the communication, storage, and computing resources upon which information systems operate” (Tallinn Manual, 15).\n³ Marko Milanovic, *Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 23–25. See also, Uta Kohl, “Jurisdiction in cyberspace,” in *Research Handbook*, eds., Tsagourias and Buchan, 30–54.\n⁴ E.g., Art. 27(1) of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter referred to as “UNCLOS”) authorizes the coastal State to exercise criminal jurisdiction over a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea to arrest any person or to conduct any investigation in connection with any crime committed on board the ship during its passage if the consequences of the crime extend to the coastal State.\n⁵ Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944, Arts. 1 and 2; UNCLOS, Art. 2(1).\n⁶ *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, chap. 9 Air law.\n⁷ Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944, Art. 3(c).\n⁸ *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, chap. 9 Air law.\n2.1 Jurisdiction In addition, it has become acceptable for a State to exercise jurisdiction based on passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace.⁹ Under the active personality principle of jurisdiction, a State may exercise jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender is a national of that State. Several States have also asserted jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender’s victim is a national of that State – this is based on the passive personality principle of jurisdiction. Three judges of the ICJ noted in February 2002 that passive personality jurisdiction, which was previously regarded as controversial, is now reflected in the legislation of various States including the US and France “and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so far as a particular category of offences is concerned”.¹⁰ The more serious the offences, the less likely that opposition to the exercise of passive personality jurisdiction will face. Passive personality jurisdiction is an option in, for example, the 1970 Hague Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 1985 Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture; the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance; the 1997 Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; the 1999 Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; the 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the 2006 Enforced Disappearance Convention; and the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism.\nA State may, based on the protective principle, exercise jurisdiction over the offender whose conduct abroad threatens that State’s security or interferes with the operation of its government functions.¹¹ The most controversial base of jurisdiction is universal jurisdiction, whereby a State asserts jurisdiction over a crime which has no connection (nexus) with that State at all. In other words, the crime is committed outside its territory, does not have any effect therein, and neither the perpetrator nor the victim is its national. It has long been accepted that every State may exercise universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of piracy. Apart from that, it is still controversial whether a State may exercise universal jurisdiction absent treaty obligations binding on the States concerned – as in the case of the obligation to prosecute or extradite commonly found ⁹See further, Henrik Spang-Hanssen, Cyberspace &amp; International Law on Jurisdiction (Copenhagen: DJØF Publishing, 2004), chaps. 31, 32; Tallinn Manual, 18.\n¹⁰Para. 47 of the Joint Separate Opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal, Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Dem.

DPP [1946] AC 34.\n\nin many multilateral conventions on suppression of serious crimes of international concern like international terrorism.¹² With regard to the jurisdiction to enforce, as early as 1928, the Permanent Court of Arbitration enunciated the principle that a State “cannot take measures on the territory of another state by way of enforcement of national laws without the consent of the latter”.¹³ This principle was also affirmed by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Lotus case, adding that: “In these circumstances, all that can be required of a State is that it should not overstep the limits which international law places upon its jurisdiction; within these limits, its title to exercise jurisdiction rests in its sovereignty”.¹⁴ Therefore, a State may not enforce its criminal law, that is, investigate crimes or arrest suspects, in the territory of another State without that other State’s consent.¹⁵ In this regard, it should be noted that the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (or the Budapest Convention), which is the only multilateral agreement in force on cybercrime, utilizes territorial jurisdiction and jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender as the bases for exercise of jurisdiction over cyber criminal offences.¹⁶ According to a study by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in general, “forms of territoriality-based and nationality-based jurisdiction are almost always able to ensure a sufficient connection between cybercrime acts and at least one State”.¹⁷ The territoriality-based jurisdiction “can be made with reference to elements or effects of [a cybercrime], or the location of computer systems or data utilized for the offence”.¹⁸ Utilization of cloud services poses new challenges for law enforcement. Cloud computing, or Internet-based computing, delivers information services and information over the Internet, without the need for certain hardware or software at the ¹² Cf.

The processing in cloud computing may occur in several States simultaneously. It is submitted that in this type of situation more than one State have concurrent jurisdiction over a crime committed via cloud computing, pursuant to any one of jurisdictional bases mentioned above insofar as it is applicable to the facts in question.\nCurrently, fibre-optic cables buried in the seabed are the main conduits of the Internet since satellites have limited capacity compared to cables and are, thus, much more expensive and their use is confined mainly to broadcasting as well as for Internet usage by communities in very remote regions.²¹ A State has sovereignty over communication cables lying within its land territory, internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It can adopt laws and regulations to protect submarine cables in its territorial sea, for example.²² To accommodate the interest of existing submarine cables, the law of the sea as codified in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS) requires an archipelagic State, which is recognized pursuant to UNCLOS, to respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. In addition, an archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them.²³ In the maritime area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea called the “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State is measured, all States generally enjoy the freedom of the laying of submarine cables, with due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS and other rules of international law insofar as they are not incompatible therewith.²⁴ This freedom is permissible as it is not an exercise of sovereign rights over the natural resources which is reserved exclusively for the coastal State in whose EEZ the laying of submarine cables takes place.²⁵ ¹⁹ Nancy J.

All States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the continental shelf of another State. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables. The coastal State may set conditions for cables entering its land territory, internal waters or territorial sea. The coastal State also has jurisdiction over cables constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. When laying submarine cables, States are required to have due regard to cables already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables shall not be prejudiced.\nInternational law is silent as to whether and to what extent such cables are subject to the jurisdiction of the States that own them or whose nationals have laid and operate them. In particular, it is doubtful whether these States may take the measures necessary to protect their cables against malicious interference. Marine cables protection zones are permitted in the territorial sea, by virtue of Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS, but not in maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the case of submarine cables lying beyond the territorial sea, Article 113 of UNCLOS requires every State to criminalize their breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications. The provision predated the age of the Internet. Nevertheless, as fibre-optic cables are used in telecommunication that includes telephonic communications, the cables are covered under this UNCLOS provision. This provision applies also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, but it does not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury. Article 114 of UNCLOS requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable, cause a break in or injury to another cable, they shall bear the cost of the repairs. Article 115 requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.\nBesides UNCLOS, the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, in force since 1 May 1888, regulates interference with telegraph cables outside territorial waters of its Parties. It accords the competent jurisdiction to the court of the State in which the vessel in question is registered (“flag State”) and the State of nationality of the offender, in that order. The Convention makes it a punishable offence to break or injure a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages. This provision does not apply to cases where those who break or injure a cable do so with the lawful object of saving their lives or their ship, after they have taken every necessary precaution to avoid so breaking or injuring the cable. There are merely 41 States Parties to the 1884 Convention, though.\nWith regard to unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, Article 109 of UNCLOS requires all States to cooperate in its suppression. “Unauthorized broadcasting” is defined as “the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls”. This provision predated the era of the Internet, and one may question whether it covers transmission by cyber means. It is hereby submitted that if there is some cyber involvement in transmitting sound radio or television broadcast such as using cyber-facilitated means to stream radio and television via the Internet or to disseminate information, especially through social media platforms such as Twitter, vk.com, Facebook, this definition of broadcasting can be interpreted to cover transmission via the Internet. This present author agrees with the position of the majority of the experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the object and purpose of proscribing unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas are primarily the prevention of interference with broadcasting that is not in compliance with international regulations, such as the regulation of broadcasting frequencies, and produces negative effects on maritime or air communications. The posting of online material, including online propaganda, from the high seas poses no such risks and is not covered by this prohibition -- there is no difference whether online material is posted from a vessel in the high seas or on land. The following provisions on unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas must be understood in this context.\nArticle 109 of UNCLOS provides that any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas may be prosecuted before the court of: (a) the flag State of the ship from which the broadcast is made; (b) the State of registry of the installation from which the broadcast is made; (c) the State of which the person is a national; (d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or (e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference. The State having the said jurisdiction may, in conformity with Article 110 of UNCLOS, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus. Article 110 stipulates that, except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign ship, other than a warship or a ship owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service, may board it if there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the foreign ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109; the foreign ship is without nationality; or though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship. Article 110 applies mutatis mutandis to military aircraft as well as to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service which encounter the suspected ship.\nUNCLOS is supplemented by other international instruments in this matter. For example, the 1965 European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations Outside National Territories regulates broadcasting stations which are installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other floating or airborne objects and which, outside national territories, transmit broadcasts intended for reception or capable of being received, wholly or in part, within the territory of any Contracting Party, or which cause harmful interference to any radio-communication service operating under the authority of a Contracting Party in accordance with the Radio Regulations. Each Contracting Party undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of the said broadcasting, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, apply the provisions of this Agreement in regard to its nationals who have committed any of the aforesaid offences on its territory, ships, or aircraft, or outside national territories on any ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne object; and non-nationals who, on its territory, ships or aircraft, or on board any floating or airborne object under its jurisdiction have committed any of such acts. The Agreement implements the said Radio Regulations, annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, which prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories. The Regulations define broadcasting stations as those in the “broadcasting service”, which is itself defined as a radio-communication service of transmissions to be received directly by the general public, including transmissions of sounds or transmissions by television, facsimile or other means. The term “other means” is broad enough to cover the Internet and other cyber-facilitated means of broadcasting.\nWith regard to the right of visit in the high seas, Article 110 of UNCLOS authorizes warships or other duly authorized vessels or aircraft to board a foreign vessel encountered on the high seas which is not a foreign warship or vessel owned or operated by a foreign State and used only on government non-commercial service when there is a “reasonable ground for suspecting” it is engaged in piracy, slave trading or unauthorized broadcasting, appears to be without nationality, or is of the nationality of the visiting vessel but appears to be disguising its nationality. However, the International Group of Experts writing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were split as to 2.1 Jurisdiction whether the right of visit includes the right of “virtual visit”, for example, by using cyber means to verify the nationality of the vessel concerned by monitoring its communications, and inspect its cyber infrastructure remotely when suspicion remains that the vessel is engaged in any of the aforesaid proscribed activities.²⁹ This present author submits that it does so include.\nIn a near future, global Internet access from satellites, akin to rebuilding the Internet in space, may become a real possibility.³⁰ The draftsmen of the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime considered it unnecessary to establish jurisdiction over offences involving satellites registered in the name of a State, because unlawful communications by satellites originated from and/or was received on earth, and the satellites were mere mediums of transmission.³¹ This perception may need to be reconsidered in light of the report that nation-State hackers have, since 2007, used a Digital Video Broadband satellite provider covering the Middle East and Africa to hide the actual location and activities of advanced persistent threat (APT) from the “Turla” malware attack. Latching onto unencrypted connections between active IP addresses and satellites to route the traffic to an unused port disguised as the legitimate IP of the user makes the APTs almost impossible to shut down because the cyber infrastructure hosting the cyberattack is not traceable. Although satellite communications usually provide slow and frequently unstable speeds, this cyberattack method is relatively inexpensive to implement, at the cost of initial investment of less than US$1000 and regular maintenance of less than US$1000 per year.³² Google, an important Internet Service Provider (ISP), has “Project Loon” which launches balloons into the stratospheres, at least 20 km (12 miles) above the earth surface, to beam Internet access to users beneath the balloons’ path.³³ Internet connectivity on board an aircraft is now made possible via an antenna on the aircraft’s fuselage which exchanges signals to and from the ground through the nearest satellite in a chain of geostationary satellites situated around the equator approximately 36,000 km above the earth.³⁴ Space law, thus, becomes relevant to the use of cyberspace.\nArticle VIII of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial ²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, chap. 8 Law of the sea.\n³⁰ “SpaceX chief Musk eyes Internet satellites: report,” China Post, 12 Nov. 2014, 6; Melody Peterson, “Google may invest in SpaceX to back Elon Musk’s satellite project,” Los Angeles Times, 19 Jan. 2015; “SpaceX aims to launch internet from space”, BBC, 17 Nov. 2016.\n³¹ Explanatory Report of 8 Nov. 2001 to the convention adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, para. 234, cited in Spang-Hanssen, Public International Computer Network Law Issues, 318.\n³² Dan Worth, “Turla APT malware threat uses satellites to avoid detection,” Security, 9 Sept. 2015, reporting on the finding of Kaspersky Lab.

Of course, this is subject to other permissible bases of jurisdiction exercisable by other States as explained above. Article III of the Treaty stipulates that space activities are to be carried out “in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding”. They must also be for peaceful purposes,³⁶ but this does not preclude the right to exercise self-defence in outer space or by employing space-based assets to defend against armed attacks launched from outer space against targets on earth.³⁷ ## 2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility Actors in cyberspace are States, individuals, other non-State actors, and their proxies.³⁸ There are problems in attributing a cyber activity to any specific person or entity, especially in light of the anonymity of the author of that activity whose identification depends on the ability of the interested party to verify, or back trace, that author.\nSuch anonymity may be achieved in several ways. Virtual private networking (VPN) tunnels the entire network traffic which is encrypted between the start (“client”) and the endpoint (“server”) located elsewhere before data is transmitted to the resource that the user is actually trying to access. Another method is using proxy servers which allow users to hide their IP address by tunnelling all specific types of traffic through another server, and the accessed host need not be a web server. Yet another method is the use of anonymous networks with the “onion routing” technique, utilizing multiple public or private proxy servers to relay encrypted data across many randomly chosen nodes on the anonymity network with multiple layers of encryption applied to the transmitted data, and each relay node decrypting the following layer until the original data is revealed and sent to the intended recipient. Another method involves infecting the computer of another person with malware so that the person planting the malware can control that computer in order to undertake ³⁵ United Kingdom Treaty Ser.

Finally, users may conceal their personal information or identities to remain anonymous online.³⁹ It may be possible to validate the origin of data and verify the sender’s digital signature through a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) which validates a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication, but this is not popularly used.⁴⁰ For the purpose of attribution in cyberspace, one must identify the originating source of communication by going over the route by which the communication has come, the person/entity behind it, and whether that person/entity is directed or controlled by another person/entity or a State.\nBack-tracing or back-tracking is the most common method to identify the afore-said point of departure. This includes locating the IP address or addresses, determining the point of contact, and luring the hacker into revealing more details about his/its identity. The more proficient the hacker is, the less successful the back-tracing becomes.⁴¹ However, some types of data that can be collected are relatively difficult to hide and the patterns of how a person browses and clicks through a website may lead to his/its identity.⁴² Even where a cyberattack has no international connection, law enforcement authorities not infrequently run into difficulties in apprehending the right perpetrator. In Japan, for example, in 2012 a hacker named Yusuke Katayama (a.k.a. Demon Killer) infected computers belonging to strangers with a Trojan Horse virus and then sent death threats from these computers. Several persons who owned the computers remotely controlled by Katayama were wrongly arrested and subsequently exonerated. Only after Katayama had made an error by sending a riddle containing information that could only have been known by the real perpetrator of the death threats were the police able to identify and arrest him. The police were told by a message to look for a cat at a specific location. The cat was wearing a collar on which was a memory card with details of the code and malicious programme Katayama had used to gain remote control of his victims’ computers. The cat was seen with Katayama on CCTV footage, leading to his arrest in February 2013.⁴³ The hackers of the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system in November and December 2014 did not connect directly to Sony’s network, but attacked it by connecting through one or more relay computers at different locations (or using the “stepping stone” systems) in order to hide their actual location. The first evidence of the hack was reported to have been traced to a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, and then New York, Poland, Italy, Bolivia, Singapore, and Cyprus.

The hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace (GoP) made threats against cinemas intending to show the film *The Interview*, a comedy produced by Sony about the assassination of North Korea’s Head of State, and their audiences. On 1 December 2014, the FBI issued a five-page confidential warning to US businesses in general that cyber hackers had used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US, making it impossible to recover any lost data. It gave some technical details about the malware and the advice on how to deal with such an attack.⁴⁵ Subsequently, the FBI attributed the Sony hack to North Korea on the grounds that: (a) the malware used in the hack had “clear links” to malware developed by North Korea which had been used in a cyberattack in March 2014 against South Korean banks and media outlets, and had been traced to an IP address in Pyongyang, North Korea; (b) the tools used in the said Sony attack had “similarities” to the ones developed by North Korea in specific lines of computer code, encryption algorithms, and data deletion methods; and (c) the statements and threats in connection with the Sony attacks were similar in terms of behaviour to other known attacks by the North Koreans.⁴⁶ The North Korean Government itself initially refused to deny that it was behind the Sony hack,⁴⁷ but subsequently denied it outright and challenged the US to provide evidence to substantiate any allegation that North Korea was the culprit.⁴⁸ The FBI’s attribution was not free from criticisms. Skeptics contended that the FBI was very careful not to allege that the attack was controlled from within North Korea. It was also doubted whether a nation State like North Korea could have acted alone without assistance from outside. The FBI insisted that it had “undisclosed intelligence” to confirm the attribution of the Sony attack to North Korea, but doubts about the veracity of such intelligence were raised, drawing a comparison between it and the undisclosed – and subsequently proven to be false – intelligence on ⁴⁴ “Sony hack puts spotlight on Pyongyang ISP,” *Bangkok Post*, 20 Dec. 2014; Lev Grossman, “What Sony’s Hackers Know”, *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 20.\n⁴⁵ “FBI warns firms of destructive malware use by hackers,” BBC, 2 Dec. 2014.\n⁴⁶ “Obama vows response to ‘N Korea cyber attack’”, *Al Jazeera*, 19 Dec. 2014; “Sony hack: Obama vows response as FBI blames North Korea,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; “FBI director gives new clues tying North Korea to Sony hack,” *Associated Press*, 7 Jan. 2015; Alex Altman and Sam Frizell, “Hollywood Hacked: Why no company is immune,” *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 19.\n⁴⁷ “North Korea refuses to deny Sony Pictures cyber-attack”, *BBC*, 1 Dec. 2014. When asked about its possible involvement in the hack, a spokesman at North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the UN in New York replied: “The hostile forces are relating everything to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I kindly advise you to just wait and see.”\n⁴⁸ Madison Park and Dana Ford, “North Korea to U.S.: Show evidence we hacked Sony,” *CNN*, 14 Jan. 2015, reporting on the press briefing on 13 Jan. 2015 by North Korea’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, New York.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility Saddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction”.⁴⁹ Adding to the confusion was a claim by the group named Lizard Squad which had repeatedly hacked Sony’s network in 2014. An alleged member of the Lizard Squad gave an interview claiming that the group had shared some login data stolen from Sony’s employees with the Guardians of Peace, thereby throwing some doubt on the theory that the North Korean Government was behind the Sony hack at all. There was also a possibility that the hack could have been contracted out by the North Korean Government to private hackers.⁵⁰ One of the lessons from this Sony hack episode, according to two experts on cybersecurity, is that attribution of cyberattacks is hard, “mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion”, not the court of law.⁵¹ The same could be said of: (a) the conclusion in 2013 by US cybersecurity firm Mandiant that the Chinese Government was behind one of the world’s prolific group of computer hackers since these hackers could be traced to a location near Shanghai in China which is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a signals intelligence division of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA); and (b) the report in September 2015 by ThreatConnect and Defense Group Inc.⁵² The latter based its attribution of the spyware and “phishing” attacks studied to a hacker collectively known as “Nikon” at a military intelligence unit of the PLA in Kunming, southern China. A member of the Chinese military was identified as the operator of a domain called “GreenSky27” from which the spyware and attacks originated, based on his profile, online activities, and academic publications.\nIndeed, no one has ever come up with conclusive, as opposed to circumstantial evidence, as to who hacked the White House in October 2014, JPMorgan, Nasdaq, and so forth. The 20 March 2013 cyberattack, known as “Dark Seoul”, paralyzed approximately 48,000 computers at several major banks and broadcasters in South Korea, disrupting network systems and deleting files in their hard disks. The cyber hack occurred not long after, owing to the growing tensions between the two Koreas, the North Korean Government had announced it would terminate the armistice agreement which had ended the Korean War in July 1953. On 23 December 2014, computers at South Korea’s nuclear operator were breached, with the hackers trying to steal data, including plant blueprints and personnel information, therefrom. South Korean investigators were reported to have said that they had proof that the hacking ⁴⁹ Dave Lee, “What is FBI evidence for North Korea hack attack?,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; Brian Todd and Ben Brumfield, “Experts doubt North Korea was behind the Sony hack”, CNN, 27 Dec. 2014. A security expert who was part of the South Korean Government’s investigation into the March 2013 cyberattacks attributed to North Korea was reported to have opined that, unlike the March 2013 attack, the Sony attack in December 2014 could not be linked to IP addresses in North Korea (“Security experts doubt North Korea hacked Sony,” Taiwan News, 4 Dec. 2014, 6).\n⁵⁰ “Sony hackers ‘shared’ stolen employee login data,” BBC, 30 Dec. 2014.\n⁵¹ Peter W. Singer and Allan Friedman, “5 lessons from the Sony hack,” CNN, 17 Dec. 2014.

According to the newspaper, it was the evidence gathered by the malware planted by the NSA to track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by North Korea’s hackers that convinced the US authorities that North Korea had been behind the Sony hack.⁵⁴ Since 19 October 2015, Facebook notifies its users whenever it believes that their accounts have been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working for a nation State, so that the users can take security measures to secure their online accounts. This is when the attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others and when detailed analyses by Facebook’s own technical experts, taking into account victims’ reports, show strong indication of the involvement of States or State-sponsored entities or persons. Facebook thus follows Google which has taken a similar step since mid-2012.⁵⁵ Microsoft has taken the same measure since 30 December 2015.⁵⁶ ## 2.2.1 ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility Guidance on attribution for the purpose of international law of State responsibility is to be sought from the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (2001), which has been relied extensively by the International Court of Justice to interpret international law in this matter.⁵⁷ The Tallinn Manual also follows the ILC’s Draft Articles very closely when it posits: “[u]nder international law, States may be responsible for ⁵³ K.J.

The actions of non-State actors may also sometimes be attributable to States.”58 Chapter II of the ILC’s Draft Articles, entitled “Attribution of conduct to a State”, explains the rules as follows.\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails that State’s international responsibility.59 The State is treated as a unity, consistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. Therefore, the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. In this connection, a State organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.60 The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority is considered an act attributed to the State under international law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.61 If an organ is placed at the disposal of a State by another State, the conduct of such organ is considered an act of the former State under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the State at whose disposal it is placed.62 The conduct of such an organ of a State or a person or entity is considered an act attributed to the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.63 Besides, the conduct of a person or group of persons is considered an act attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of that State in carrying out the conduct.64 A general situation of dependence on or support from a State is insufficient for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of the person or group of persons to the State – the State must be able to assert “effective control” over the Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States” (ibid., 26). However, there is no consensus as to whether this Rule also applies if the State has only constructive (“should have known”) knowledge or whether this Rule applies to States through which cyber operations are routed (ibid., p. 28). See also ibid., 34–36.\n\nconduct in question in the sense of the State’s actual participation of and directions given to the conduct.⁶⁵ The International Court of Justice has affirmed that: State’s responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons — neither State organs nor to be equated with such organs — only if, assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful, they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in Article 8 [of the ILC’s Draft Articles mentioned above]. This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed...⁶⁶ This means the “effective control” must be exercised, or that the State’s instructions are given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.⁶⁷ The ICJ rejects the “overall control” test as “stretch[ing] too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”.⁶⁸ The US position regarding “proxy actors” in cyberspace is in line with the test just mentioned. According to the US, States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors”, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it....⁶⁹ The ILC’s Draft Articles also cover exceptional cases, such as during revolution, armed conflict or foreign occupation, where the regular authorities dissolve, are disintegrating, have been suppressed or are for the time being inoperative, as well as cases where lawful authority is being gradually restored, e.g., after foreign occupation. In these circumstances, the conduct of a person or group of persons is ⁶⁵ Para. (4), ILC Commentary to Art. 8 and para. (2), ILC Commentary to Art. 10 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (ILC Yearbook 2001, vol. II, Part Two, 47–48, 50). The ILC bases its conclusion on the test established by the ICJ in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA), ICJ Rep. 1986, paras. 65, 109, 115.\n⁶⁶ Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), ICJ Rep. 2007, p. 43, para. 406.\n⁶⁷ Ibid., para. 400.\n⁶⁸ Ibid., para. 406.\n⁶⁹ “International Law in Cyberspace”, remarks by Harold Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser, US Department of State, US CYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, Ft. Meade, MD, 18 Sept. 2012.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact exercising elements of the governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities and in circumstances such as to call for the exercise of those elements of authority.70 The ILC cites as an example the position of the Revolutionary Guards or “Komitehs” immediately after the revolution in the Islamic Republic of Iran who performed immigration, customs and similar functions at Tehran airport in the immediate aftermath of the revolution.71 As a general rule, the conduct of an insurrectional movement cannot be attributed to the State. However, where the movement achieves its aims and either installs itself as the new Government of the State or forms a new State in part of the territory of the pre-existing State or in a territory under its administration, its conduct is considered to be attributable to that State under international law, and the predecessor State will not be responsible for that conduct except in exceptional cases where the predecessor State was in a position to adopt measures of vigilance, prevention or punishment in respect of the movement’s conduct but improperly failed to do so and this has resulted in an injury or damage to another State.72 Where a State acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own, that conduct is considered an act of that State under international to the extent acknowledged and adopted as such by the State.73 Finally, State A is internationally responsible for aiding or assisting State B in the commission of an international wrongful act by State B if State A does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and if the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by State A itself.74 This requires a close connection between the act of aiding or assisting and the eventual wrongful act of State B. The support must have a substantial effect in the sense of making it materially easier to commit the wrongful act which State A is obligated not to commit itself.75 In addition to responsibility for cyber activities attributed to a State, general international law imposes on every State the due diligence duty “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This rule has been laid down by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.76 The territorial State must exercise its due diligence duty as it can be reasonably expected to do so. Thus, a transit State where the Internet is routed through its territory or a developing State from where a cyber activity is launched can only be expected to take any action expected of it when it becomes aware of the activity and only in accordance with its technological capability.⁷⁷ Although the International Group of Experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual could not agree whether constructive knowledge sufficed to entail the due diligence duty, this present author believes that a State must, according to either its actual or constructive knowledge and in light of its technological capability, take measures as may be reasonably expected of it to prevent or stop its territory from being used by a cyberattacker to injure another State.⁷⁸ However, it will take time for State practice to settle on what such reasonable measures actually are.\n## 2.2.2 Standard(s) of Proof In apprehending cyber criminals, law enforcement authorities arrest suspects on the basis of evidence which must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt in a criminal court of law. In case of State responsibility, however, the accuser must prove that an unlawful cyber activity is “attributable” or “attributed” to a State using the applicable international legal standard explained in Sect. 2.2.1.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s Rule 7 (Cyber operations launched from governmental infrastructure) reads: “The mere fact that a cyber operation has been launched or otherwise originates from governmental cyber infrastructure is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State but is an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation”. Its Rule 8 (Cyber operations routed through a State) provides: “The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State.” The rules are sound, bearing in mind that the origin of the massive cyberattack on Estonia, of which Tallinn is its capital city, in April and May 2007 was traced back to 177 other States around the world!⁷⁹ “Clear and compelling” information or evidence was cited by the US and NATO in support of their conclusion that Al-Qaeda was behind the 11 September 2001 ⁷⁷ Michael N.

On “proxy cyberattacks”, see Libicki, *Crisis*, 84–89.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility attacks on US soil.⁸⁰ This standard is higher than that of “preponderance of the evidence” (i.e., “more likely than not”) in certain civil and administrative proceedings but lower than that of “beyond a reasonable doubt” in criminal law.⁸¹ The ICJ in *Oil Platform (Islamic Republic of Iran v. USA)* uses the terms “direct evidence”, which is not merely “suggestive”, and “conclusive” evidence. It is the State making the assertion which bears the burden of proof.⁸² In other cases, the ICJ refers to the need for “conclusive evidence”,⁸³ “a degree of certainty”,⁸⁴ “inferences of fact …[which] leave no room for reasonable doubt”,⁸⁵ “degree of certainty … supported by convincing evidence”,⁸⁶ “clear evidence”,⁸⁷ “[relevant facts] convincingly established by the evidence”,⁸⁸ “evidence [that is] weighty and convincing”,⁸⁹ and “evidence that is fully conclusive”.⁹⁰ One veteran cyber threat analyst suggests some set of rules of thumb to prove attribution. Firstly, identify the architects of the malware by looking at a particular, identifying style of the malware. Secondly, consider the timing of the attack which may show the context in which the attack occurs. Thirdly, look at the victims to find out who would benefit from the attack. The analyst concludes, however, that in the end it comes down to a matter of speculation.⁹¹ Even when low-level, unsophisticated hacking against a group of persons opposed to the terrorist group operating under the name of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was discovered, it could not be confirmed that the hacking came from ISIL.⁹² Ironically, North Korea’s Internet was suddenly shut down for 9 h and 31 min on 22–23 December 2014 with no one claiming responsibility at that time, and it could not be proven then whether this was a counterattack by the US Government or by hacktivist groups like Anonymous which had targeted North ⁸⁰ Letter dated 7 Oct. 2001 from the Permanent Rep. of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N.

States are, thus, expected to act as reasonable States objectively would in same or similar circumstances, taking into due consideration such cumulative factors as the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the evidence when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.⁹⁵ One learned author argues that the test of proving attribution for the purpose of State responsibility as explained above is out of touch with cyber reality. According to this view, “attribution asymmetry” in cyberspace makes it more difficult for the victim State to trace cyberattacks from non-State actors who are assisted by a State, while making it easier for the State behind the cyberattacks to control such attacks. This, arguably, provides an incentive for the victim State to resort to using non-State actors to counterattack the State it suspects to be behind an initial attack. A test focusing on “virtual control” is proposed instead, with the burden shifting to a State to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyberattack when that State funds and equips a non-State actor who subsequently launch a cyberattack – this is because the funding/equipping State has greater access to the relevant information concerning possible attribution of responsibility than the victim State does.⁹⁶ It would also establish a rebuttable presumption that when State infrastructure is used for a cyberattack, the State owning the infrastructure is responsible. The new test would also help ensure that the State exercise due diligence not to allow its territory, infrastructure, equipment, or funding to be used for a cyberattack against another State – and if it fails to be duly diligent this would entail State responsibility. The new test would draw upon the ICJ’s reasoning in Nicaragua v. USA where the ICJ noted that the contras continued to fight in Nicaragua even after the US Government had ended its funding to the group on 1 October 1984; hence, a rebuttable presumption that, subject to evidence to the contrary, the US was no longer in control of the contras.⁹⁷ Disassociation from non-State actors suspected of launching a cyberattack ⁹³ Jo Biddle, “N. Korea’s Internet collapses after Sony hack,” AFP, 22 Dec. 2014; id., “Who cut North Korea’s Internet?,” AFP, 23 Dec. 2014.\n⁹⁴ David E.

Judgment in Tadic (Case No. IT-94-1-A, 15 Jul 1999) that the continuing salary payment by the Rep. of Yugoslavia to an armed group did indicate control of the group by the Rep. of Yugoslavia.\n2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility also shows the good faith on the part of the disassociating State.⁹⁸ It could take years to see if this proposed new test will be endorsed by State practice in relation to cyberspace. In the meantime, all the factors cited in support of the proposed new test can be taken into consideration in determining whether a cyber activity is attributable to a State pursuant to the existing international law of State responsibility.\nPresently, we may sometimes see the different positions/standards on attribution adopted by intelligence agencies, on the one hand, and law enforcement agencies, on the other hand. The former assess information and evidence, including circumstantial evidence and undisclosed human intelligence, to substantiate their suspicion that an entity or person is behind a cyberattack. The latter usually needs evidence that can stand up in courts of law before they can conclude who is the perpetrator of a cyberattack. This should explain the position taken by the US intelligence agencies and the initial one taken by the FBI, a US national law enforcement agency, in the aftermath of the allegations that a foreign State was behind cyber activities to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016.⁹⁹ In international relations, it is diplomatically wise and legally permissible to respond to an offensive act by another State commensurate with the level of certainty that the other State is behind the act: the more certain the evidence is, the more severe the response can be, provided that the response does not exceed the permissible bounds of international law.

    "2 Jurisdiction and Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace\n\ninclude jurisdiction, which is the authority of the State to regulate conduct of natural persons or legal entities by its own domestic law. Jurisdiction to prescribe is the State's authority to legislate or prescribe law and regulations. Jurisdiction to enforce is the State's authority to enforce the law and regulations legislated or prescribed by it. There is also an adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts of the State to interpret its law and regulations.³\n\nJurisdiction is primarily territorial. A State may exercise jurisdiction over cyber infrastructure and over the intangible based on territoriality, including “subjective territorial jurisdiction” over an incident originating in a State’s territory but consummated elsewhere, and “objective territorial jurisdiction” over individuals where an incident has effects on the State’s territory although the act was initiated elsewhere.⁴ This territorial jurisdiction extends to the airspace superjacent to the land territory and territorial waters under the State’s sovereignty.⁵ For example, a State has jurisdiction over civilian aircraft with airborne cyber infrastructure to hack into Wi-Fi networks or eavesdrop on cell phone calls and text messages and to exfiltrate or otherwise interfere with data in the State’s territory being overflown and may order the aircraft to land to submit to the jurisdiction of the territorial State for violation of its law.⁶ In case of State aircraft, they must get prior authorization from the territorial State over which they intend to overfly, and the authorization may comprise conditions,⁷ violation of which entitles the territorial State to demand that the aircraft in question cease the violation and depart its airspace without delay, and, if the aircraft refuses, to take necessary and proportional measures against that aircraft.⁸\n\npersons coordinated by Prof. M.

    "2.1 Jurisdiction\n\nIn addition, it has become acceptable for a State to exercise jurisdiction based on passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace.⁹\n\nUnder the active personality principle of jurisdiction, a State may exercise jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender is a national of that State. Several States have also asserted jurisdiction over the offender on the basis that the offender’s victim is a national of that State – this is based on the passive personality principle of jurisdiction. Three judges of the ICJ noted in February 2002 that passive personality jurisdiction, which was previously regarded as controversial, is now reflected in the legislation of various States including the US and France “and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so far as a particular category of offences is concerned”.¹⁰ The more serious the offences, the less likely that opposition to the exercise of passive personality jurisdiction will face. Passive personality jurisdiction is an option in, for example, the 1970 Hague Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 1985 Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture; the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance; the 1997 Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; the 1999 Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism; the 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the 2006 Enforced Disappearance Convention; and the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism.\n\nA State may, based on the protective principle, exercise jurisdiction over the offender whose conduct abroad threatens that State’s security or interferes with the operation of its government functions.¹¹\n\nThe most controversial base of jurisdiction is universal jurisdiction, whereby a State asserts jurisdiction over a crime which has no connection (nexus) with that State at all. In other words, the crime is committed outside its territory, does not have any effect therein, and neither the perpetrator nor the victim is its national. It has long been accepted that every State may exercise universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of piracy. Apart from that, it is still controversial whether a State may exercise universal jurisdiction absent treaty obligations binding on the States concerned – as in the case of the obligation to prosecute or extradite commonly found\n\n⁹See further, Henrik Spang-Hanssen, Cyberspace &amp; International Law on Jurisdiction (Copenhagen: DJØF Publishing, 2004), chaps. 31, 32; Tallinn Manual, 18.\n\n¹⁰Para. 47 of the Joint Separate Opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal, Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Dem.

The processing in cloud computing may occur in several States simultaneously. It is submitted that in this type of situation more than one State have concurrent jurisdiction over a crime committed via cloud computing, pursuant to any one of jurisdictional bases mentioned above insofar as it is applicable to the facts in question.\n\nCurrently, fibre-optic cables buried in the seabed are the main conduits of the Internet since satellites have limited capacity compared to cables and are, thus, much more expensive and their use is confined mainly to broadcasting as well as for Internet usage by communities in very remote regions.²¹\n\nA State has sovereignty over communication cables lying within its land territory, internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It can adopt laws and regulations to protect submarine cables in its territorial sea, for example.²² To accommodate the interest of existing submarine cables, the law of the sea as codified in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS) requires an archipelagic State, which is recognized pursuant to UNCLOS, to respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. In addition, an archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them.²³ In the maritime area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea called the “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State is measured, all States generally enjoy the freedom of the laying of submarine cables, with due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS and other rules of international law insofar as they are not incompatible therewith.²⁴ This freedom is permissible as it is not an exercise of sovereign rights over the natural resources which is reserved exclusively for the coastal State in whose EEZ the laying of submarine cables takes place.²⁵\n\n¹⁹ Nancy J.

    "Article 79 of UNCLOS is a main provision regulating submarine cables on the continental shelf, which comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine area extending beyond the territorial sea of the coastal State. All States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the continental shelf of another State. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables. The coastal State may set conditions for cables entering its land territory, internal waters or territorial sea. The coastal State also has jurisdiction over cables constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. When laying submarine cables, States are required to have due regard to cables already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables shall not be prejudiced.\n\nInternational law is silent as to whether and to what extent such cables are subject to the jurisdiction of the States that own them or whose nationals have laid and operate them. In particular, it is doubtful whether these States may take the measures necessary to protect their cables against malicious interference. Marine cables protection zones are permitted in the territorial sea, by virtue of Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS, but not in maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the case of submarine cables lying beyond the territorial sea, Article 113 of UNCLOS requires every State to criminalize their breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications. The provision predated the age of the Internet. Nevertheless, as fibre-optic cables are used in telecommunication that includes telephonic communications, the cables are covered under this UNCLOS provision. This provision applies also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, but it does not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury. Article 114 of UNCLOS requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable, cause a break in or injury to another cable, they shall bear the cost of the repairs. Article 115 requires every State to adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.",
    "Besides UNCLOS, the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, in force since 1 May 1888, regulates interference with telegraph cables outside territorial waters of its Parties. It accords the competent jurisdiction to the court of the State in which the vessel in question is registered (“flag State”) and the State of nationality of the offender, in that order. The Convention makes it a punishable offence to break or injure a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages. This provision does not apply to cases where those who break or injure a cable do so with the lawful object of saving their lives or their ship, after they have taken every necessary precaution to avoid so breaking or injuring the cable. There are merely 41 States Parties to the 1884 Convention, though.\n\nWith regard to unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, Article 109 of UNCLOS requires all States to cooperate in its suppression. “Unauthorized broadcasting” is defined as “the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls”. This provision predated the era of the Internet, and one may question whether it covers transmission by cyber means. It is hereby submitted that if there is some cyber involvement in transmitting sound radio or television broadcast such as using cyber-facilitated means to stream radio and television via the Internet or to disseminate information, especially through social media platforms such as Twitter, vk.com, Facebook, this definition of broadcasting can be interpreted to cover transmission via the Internet. This present author agrees with the position of the majority of the experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the object and purpose of proscribing unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas are primarily the prevention of interference with broadcasting that is not in compliance with international regulations, such as the regulation of broadcasting frequencies, and produces negative effects on maritime or air communications. The posting of online material, including online propaganda, from the high seas poses no such risks and is not covered by this prohibition -- there is no difference whether online material is posted from a vessel in the high seas or on land. The following provisions on unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas must be understood in this context.\n\nArticle 109 of UNCLOS provides that any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas may be prosecuted before the court of: (a) the flag State of the ship from which the broadcast is made; (b) the State of registry of the installation from which the broadcast is made; (c) the State of which the person is a national; (d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or (e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference. The State having the said jurisdiction may, in conformity with Article 110 of UNCLOS, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus. Article 110 stipulates that, except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign",
    "ship, other than a warship or a ship owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service, may board it if there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the foreign ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109; the foreign ship is without nationality; or though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship. Article 110 applies mutatis mutandis to military aircraft as well as to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service which encounter the suspected ship.\n\nUNCLOS is supplemented by other international instruments in this matter. For example, the 1965 European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations Outside National Territories regulates broadcasting stations which are installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other floating or airborne objects and which, outside national territories, transmit broadcasts intended for reception or capable of being received, wholly or in part, within the territory of any Contracting Party, or which cause harmful interference to any radio-communication service operating under the authority of a Contracting Party in accordance with the Radio Regulations. Each Contracting Party undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of the said broadcasting, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, apply the provisions of this Agreement in regard to its nationals who have committed any of the aforesaid offences on its territory, ships, or aircraft, or outside national territories on any ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne object; and non-nationals who, on its territory, ships or aircraft, or on board any floating or airborne object under its jurisdiction have committed any of such acts. The Agreement implements the said Radio Regulations, annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, which prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories. The Regulations define broadcasting stations as those in the “broadcasting service”, which is itself defined as a radio-communication service of transmissions to be received directly by the general public, including transmissions of sounds or transmissions by television, facsimile or other means. The term “other means” is broad enough to cover the Internet and other cyber-facilitated means of broadcasting.\n\nWith regard to the right of visit in the high seas, Article 110 of UNCLOS authorizes warships or other duly authorized vessels or aircraft to board a foreign vessel encountered on the high seas which is not a foreign warship or vessel owned or operated by a foreign State and used only on government non-commercial service when there is a “reasonable ground for suspecting” it is engaged in piracy, slave trading or unauthorized broadcasting, appears to be without nationality, or is of the nationality of the visiting vessel but appears to be disguising its nationality. However, the International Group of Experts writing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were split as to",
    "2.1 Jurisdiction\n\nwhether the right of visit includes the right of “virtual visit”, for example, by using cyber means to verify the nationality of the vessel concerned by monitoring its communications, and inspect its cyber infrastructure remotely when suspicion remains that the vessel is engaged in any of the aforesaid proscribed activities.²⁹ This present author submits that it does so include.\n\nIn a near future, global Internet access from satellites, akin to rebuilding the Internet in space, may become a real possibility.³⁰ The draftsmen of the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime considered it unnecessary to establish jurisdiction over offences involving satellites registered in the name of a State, because unlawful communications by satellites originated from and/or was received on earth, and the satellites were mere mediums of transmission.³¹ This perception may need to be reconsidered in light of the report that nation-State hackers have, since 2007, used a Digital Video Broadband satellite provider covering the Middle East and Africa to hide the actual location and activities of advanced persistent threat (APT) from the “Turla” malware attack. Latching onto unencrypted connections between active IP addresses and satellites to route the traffic to an unused port disguised as the legitimate IP of the user makes the APTs almost impossible to shut down because the cyber infrastructure hosting the cyberattack is not traceable. Although satellite communications usually provide slow and frequently unstable speeds, this cyberattack method is relatively inexpensive to implement, at the cost of initial investment of less than US$1000 and regular maintenance of less than US$1000 per year.³² Google, an important Internet Service Provider (ISP), has “Project Loon” which launches balloons into the stratospheres, at least 20 km (12 miles) above the earth surface, to beam Internet access to users beneath the balloons’ path.³³ Internet connectivity on board an aircraft is now made possible via an antenna on the aircraft’s fuselage which exchanges signals to and from the ground through the nearest satellite in a chain of geostationary satellites situated around the equator approximately 36,000 km above the earth.³⁴ Space law, thus, becomes relevant to the use of cyberspace.\n\nArticle VIII of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial\n\n²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, chap. 8 Law of the sea.\n\n³⁰ “SpaceX chief Musk eyes Internet satellites: report,” China Post, 12 Nov. 2014, 6; Melody Peterson, “Google may invest in SpaceX to back Elon Musk’s satellite project,” Los Angeles Times, 19 Jan. 2015; “SpaceX aims to launch internet from space”, BBC, 17 Nov. 2016.\n\n³¹ Explanatory Report of 8 Nov. 2001 to the convention adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, para. 234, cited in Spang-Hanssen, Public International Computer Network Law Issues, 318.\n\n³² Dan Worth, “Turla APT malware threat uses satellites to avoid detection,” Security, 9 Sept. 2015, reporting on the finding of Kaspersky Lab.

    "2 Jurisdiction and Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace\n\nBodies (or the “Outer Space Treaty”)³⁵ provides that a State Party to the Treaty on whose registry an object launched into outer space is carried shall retain jurisdiction and control over such object, and over any personnel thereof, while in outer space or on a celestial body. Of course, this is subject to other permissible bases of jurisdiction exercisable by other States as explained above. Article III of the Treaty stipulates that space activities are to be carried out “in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding”. They must also be for peaceful purposes,³⁶ but this does not preclude the right to exercise self-defence in outer space or by employing space-based assets to defend against armed attacks launched from outer space against targets on earth.³⁷\n\n## 2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\n\nActors in cyberspace are States, individuals, other non-State actors, and their proxies.³⁸ There are problems in attributing a cyber activity to any specific person or entity, especially in light of the anonymity of the author of that activity whose identification depends on the ability of the interested party to verify, or back trace, that author.\n\nSuch anonymity may be achieved in several ways. Virtual private networking (VPN) tunnels the entire network traffic which is encrypted between the start (“client”) and the endpoint (“server”) located elsewhere before data is transmitted to the resource that the user is actually trying to access. Another method is using proxy servers which allow users to hide their IP address by tunnelling all specific types of traffic through another server, and the accessed host need not be a web server. Yet another method is the use of anonymous networks with the “onion routing” technique, utilizing multiple public or private proxy servers to relay encrypted data across many randomly chosen nodes on the anonymity network with multiple layers of encryption applied to the transmitted data, and each relay node decrypting the following layer until the original data is revealed and sent to the intended recipient. Another method involves infecting the computer of another person with malware so that the person planting the malware can control that computer in order to undertake\n\n³⁵ United Kingdom Treaty Ser.

Finally, users may conceal their personal information or identities to remain anonymous online.³⁹\n\nIt may be possible to validate the origin of data and verify the sender’s digital signature through a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) which validates a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication, but this is not popularly used.⁴⁰\n\nFor the purpose of attribution in cyberspace, one must identify the originating source of communication by going over the route by which the communication has come, the person/entity behind it, and whether that person/entity is directed or controlled by another person/entity or a State.\n\nBack-tracing or back-tracking is the most common method to identify the afore-said point of departure. This includes locating the IP address or addresses, determining the point of contact, and luring the hacker into revealing more details about his/its identity. The more proficient the hacker is, the less successful the back-tracing becomes.⁴¹ However, some types of data that can be collected are relatively difficult to hide and the patterns of how a person browses and clicks through a website may lead to his/its identity.⁴²\n\nEven where a cyberattack has no international connection, law enforcement authorities not infrequently run into difficulties in apprehending the right perpetrator. In Japan, for example, in 2012 a hacker named Yusuke Katayama (a.k.a. Demon Killer) infected computers belonging to strangers with a Trojan Horse virus and then sent death threats from these computers. Several persons who owned the computers remotely controlled by Katayama were wrongly arrested and subsequently exonerated. Only after Katayama had made an error by sending a riddle containing information that could only have been known by the real perpetrator of the death threats were the police able to identify and arrest him. The police were told by a message to look for a cat at a specific location. The cat was wearing a collar on which was a memory card with details of the code and malicious programme Katayama had used to gain remote control of his victims’ computers. The cat was seen with Katayama on CCTV footage, leading to his arrest in February 2013.⁴³\n\nThe hackers of the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system in November and December 2014 did not connect directly to Sony’s network, but attacked it by connecting through one or more relay computers at different locations (or using the “stepping stone” systems) in order to hide their actual location.

The hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace (GoP) made threats against cinemas intending to show the film *The Interview*, a comedy produced by Sony about the assassination of North Korea’s Head of State, and their audiences. On 1 December 2014, the FBI issued a five-page confidential warning to US businesses in general that cyber hackers had used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US, making it impossible to recover any lost data. It gave some technical details about the malware and the advice on how to deal with such an attack.⁴⁵\n\nSubsequently, the FBI attributed the Sony hack to North Korea on the grounds that: (a) the malware used in the hack had “clear links” to malware developed by North Korea which had been used in a cyberattack in March 2014 against South Korean banks and media outlets, and had been traced to an IP address in Pyongyang, North Korea; (b) the tools used in the said Sony attack had “similarities” to the ones developed by North Korea in specific lines of computer code, encryption algorithms, and data deletion methods; and (c) the statements and threats in connection with the Sony attacks were similar in terms of behaviour to other known attacks by the North Koreans.⁴⁶ The North Korean Government itself initially refused to deny that it was behind the Sony hack,⁴⁷ but subsequently denied it outright and challenged the US to provide evidence to substantiate any allegation that North Korea was the culprit.⁴⁸\n\nThe FBI’s attribution was not free from criticisms. Skeptics contended that the FBI was very careful not to allege that the attack was controlled from within North Korea. It was also doubted whether a nation State like North Korea could have acted alone without assistance from outside. The FBI insisted that it had “undisclosed intelligence” to confirm the attribution of the Sony attack to North Korea, but doubts about the veracity of such intelligence were raised, drawing a comparison between it and the undisclosed – and subsequently proven to be false – intelligence on\n\n⁴⁴ “Sony hack puts spotlight on Pyongyang ISP,” *Bangkok Post*, 20 Dec. 2014; Lev Grossman, “What Sony’s Hackers Know”, *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 20.\n\n⁴⁵ “FBI warns firms of destructive malware use by hackers,” BBC, 2 Dec. 2014.\n\n⁴⁶ “Obama vows response to ‘N Korea cyber attack’”, *Al Jazeera*, 19 Dec. 2014; “Sony hack: Obama vows response as FBI blames North Korea,” BBC, 19 Dec. 2014; “FBI director gives new clues tying North Korea to Sony hack,” *Associated Press*, 7 Jan. 2015; Alex Altman and Sam Frizell, “Hollywood Hacked: Why no company is immune,” *Time*, 29 Dec. 2014–5 Jan. 2015, 19.\n\n⁴⁷ “North Korea refuses to deny Sony Pictures cyber-attack”, *BBC*, 1 Dec. 2014.

An alleged member of the Lizard Squad gave an interview claiming that the group had shared some login data stolen from Sony’s employees with the Guardians of Peace, thereby throwing some doubt on the theory that the North Korean Government was behind the Sony hack at all. There was also a possibility that the hack could have been contracted out by the North Korean Government to private hackers.⁵⁰\n\nOne of the lessons from this Sony hack episode, according to two experts on cybersecurity, is that attribution of cyberattacks is hard, “mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion”, not the court of law.⁵¹ The same could be said of: (a) the conclusion in 2013 by US cybersecurity firm Mandiant that the Chinese Government was behind one of the world’s prolific group of computer hackers since these hackers could be traced to a location near Shanghai in China which is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a signals intelligence division of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA); and (b) the report in September 2015 by ThreatConnect and Defense Group Inc.⁵² The latter based its attribution of the spyware and “phishing” attacks studied to a hacker collectively known as “Nikon” at a military intelligence unit of the PLA in Kunming, southern China. A member of the Chinese military was identified as the operator of a domain called “GreenSky27” from which the spyware and attacks originated, based on his profile, online activities, and academic publications.\n\nIndeed, no one has ever come up with conclusive, as opposed to circumstantial evidence, as to who hacked the White House in October 2014, JPMorgan, Nasdaq, and so forth. The 20 March 2013 cyberattack, known as “Dark Seoul”, paralyzed approximately 48,000 computers at several major banks and broadcasters in South Korea, disrupting network systems and deleting files in their hard disks. The cyber hack occurred not long after, owing to the growing tensions between the two Koreas, the North Korean Government had announced it would terminate the armistice agreement which had ended the Korean War in July 1953. On 23 December 2014, computers at South Korea’s nuclear operator were breached, with the hackers trying to steal data, including plant blueprints and personnel information, therefrom.

According to the newspaper, it was the evidence gathered by the malware planted by the NSA to track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by North Korea’s hackers that convinced the US authorities that North Korea had been behind the Sony hack.⁵⁴\n\nSince 19 October 2015, Facebook notifies its users whenever it believes that their accounts have been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working for a nation State, so that the users can take security measures to secure their online accounts.

The actions of non-State actors may also sometimes be attributable to States.”58\n\nChapter II of the ILC’s Draft Articles, entitled “Attribution of conduct to a State”, explains the rules as follows.\n\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails that State’s international responsibility.59 The State is treated as a unity, consistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. Therefore, the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. In this connection, a State organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.60 The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority is considered an act attributed to the State under international law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.61 If an organ is placed at the disposal of a State by another State, the conduct of such organ is considered an act of the former State under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the State at whose disposal it is placed.62 The conduct of such an organ of a State or a person or entity is considered an act attributed to the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.63\n\nBesides, the conduct of a person or group of persons is considered an act attributed to a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions, or under the direction or control, of that State in carrying out the conduct.64 A general situation of dependence on or support from a State is insufficient for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of the person or group of persons to the State – the State must be able to assert “effective control” over the\n\n58 Tallinn Manual, 15. See also Rule 6 (Legal responsibility of States) of the Tallinn Manual at 29–34.\n\nRule 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States” (ibid., 26). However, there is no consensus as to whether this Rule also applies if the State has only constructive (“should have known”) knowledge or whether this Rule applies to States through which cyber operations are routed (ibid., p. 28). See also ibid., 34–36.\n\n59 Art. 1 Responsibility of a State for its internationally wrongful acts.\n\n60 Art. 4 Conduct of organs of a State.\n\n61 Art. 5 Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of government authority.\n\n62 Art. 6 Conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State.\n\n63 Art. 7 Excess of authority or contravention of instructions.\n\n64 Art. 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State.",

This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed...⁶⁶\n\nThis means the “effective control” must be exercised, or that the State’s instructions are given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.⁶⁷ The ICJ rejects the “overall control” test as “stretch[ing] too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”.⁶⁸\n\nThe US position regarding “proxy actors” in cyberspace is in line with the test just mentioned. According to the US,\n\nStates are legally responsible for activities undertaken through “proxy actors”, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. The ability to mask one’s identity and geography in cyberspace and the resulting difficulties of timely, high-confidence attribution can create significant challenges for States in identifying, evaluating, and accurately responding to threats. But putting attribution problems aside for a moment, established international law does address the question of proxy actors. States are legally responsible for activities undertaken through putatively private actors, who act on the State’s instructions or under its direction or control. If a State exercises a sufficient degree of control over an ostensibly private person or group of persons committing an internationally wrongful act, the State assumes responsibility for the act, just as if official agents of the State itself had committed it. ...⁶⁹\n\nThe ILC’s Draft Articles also cover exceptional cases, such as during revolution, armed conflict or foreign occupation, where the regular authorities dissolve, are disintegrating, have been suppressed or are for the time being inoperative, as well as cases where lawful authority is being gradually restored, e.g., after foreign occupation.

However, where the movement achieves its aims and either installs itself as the new Government of the State or forms a new State in part of the territory of the pre-existing State or in a territory under its administration, its conduct is considered to be attributable to that State under international law, and the predecessor State will not be responsible for that conduct except in exceptional cases where the predecessor State was in a position to adopt measures of vigilance, prevention or punishment in respect of the movement’s conduct but improperly failed to do so and this has resulted in an injury or damage to another State.72\n\nWhere a State acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own, that conduct is considered an act of that State under international to the extent acknowledged and adopted as such by the State.73\n\nFinally, State A is internationally responsible for aiding or assisting State B in the commission of an international wrongful act by State B if State A does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and if the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by State A itself.74 This requires a close connection between the act of aiding or assisting and the eventual wrongful act of State B. The support must have a substantial effect in the sense of making it materially easier to commit the wrongful act which State A is obligated not to commit itself.75\n\nIn addition to responsibility for cyber activities attributed to a State, general international law imposes on every State the due diligence duty “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This rule has been laid down by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.76 The territorial State must exercise its due diligence duty as it can be reasonably expected to do so. Thus, a transit State where the Internet is routed through its territory or a developing State from where a cyber activity is launched can only be expected to take any action\n\n70 Art. 9 Conduct carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities.\n\n71 Para. 3 of the Commentary to Draft Art. 9, citing the ruling of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in Kenneth P.

    "2 Jurisdiction and Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace\n\nexpected of it when it becomes aware of the activity and only in accordance with its technological capability.⁷⁷\n\nAlthough the International Group of Experts who wrote the Tallinn Manual could not agree whether constructive knowledge sufficed to entail the due diligence duty, this present author believes that a State must, according to either its actual or constructive knowledge and in light of its technological capability, take measures as may be reasonably expected of it to prevent or stop its territory from being used by a cyberattacker to injure another State.⁷⁸ However, it will take time for State practice to settle on what such reasonable measures actually are.\n\n## 2.2.2 Standard(s) of Proof\n\nIn apprehending cyber criminals, law enforcement authorities arrest suspects on the basis of evidence which must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt in a criminal court of law. In case of State responsibility, however, the accuser must prove that an unlawful cyber activity is “attributable” or “attributed” to a State using the applicable international legal standard explained in Sect. 2.2.1.\n\nThe Tallinn Manual’s Rule 7 (Cyber operations launched from governmental infrastructure) reads: “The mere fact that a cyber operation has been launched or otherwise originates from governmental cyber infrastructure is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State but is an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation”. Its Rule 8 (Cyber operations routed through a State) provides: “The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State.” The rules are sound, bearing in mind that the origin of the massive cyberattack on Estonia, of which Tallinn is its capital city, in April and May 2007 was traced back to 177 other States around the world!⁷⁹\n\n“Clear and compelling” information or evidence was cited by the US and NATO in support of their conclusion that Al-Qaeda was behind the 11 September 2001\n\n⁷⁷ Michael N. Schmitt, “In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace,” *Yale Law Journal Forum* 125 (2015): 68; Libicki, *Crisis*, 24. See also the *Sambaggio Case (Italy v. Venezuela)*, 10 *Reports of International Arbitral Awards* 499 (1903), 509–510, where the Italy-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission accepted the contention that a State was only obligated to accord protection to a foreign interest insofar as permitted by the means at that State’s disposal and according to the circumstances as they might be verified.\n\n⁷⁸ The present author, therefore, concurs with Karine Bannelier-Christakis, “Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?,” *Baltic YBIL* 14 (2014): 23, 28–39.

    "2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\n\nattacks on US soil.⁸⁰ This standard is higher than that of “preponderance of the evidence” (i.e., “more likely than not”) in certain civil and administrative proceedings but lower than that of “beyond a reasonable doubt” in criminal law.⁸¹ The ICJ in *Oil Platform (Islamic Republic of Iran v. USA)* uses the terms “direct evidence”, which is not merely “suggestive”, and “conclusive” evidence. It is the State making the assertion which bears the burden of proof.⁸² In other cases, the ICJ refers to the need for “conclusive evidence”,⁸³ “a degree of certainty”,⁸⁴ “inferences of fact …[which] leave no room for reasonable doubt”,⁸⁵ “degree of certainty … supported by convincing evidence”,⁸⁶ “clear evidence”,⁸⁷ “[relevant facts] convincingly established by the evidence”,⁸⁸ “evidence [that is] weighty and convincing”,⁸⁹ and “evidence that is fully conclusive”.⁹⁰\n\nOne veteran cyber threat analyst suggests some set of rules of thumb to prove attribution. Firstly, identify the architects of the malware by looking at a particular, identifying style of the malware. Secondly, consider the timing of the attack which may show the context in which the attack occurs. Thirdly, look at the victims to find out who would benefit from the attack. The analyst concludes, however, that in the end it comes down to a matter of speculation.⁹¹ Even when low-level, unsophisticated hacking against a group of persons opposed to the terrorist group operating under the name of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was discovered, it could not be confirmed that the hacking came from ISIL.⁹² Ironically, North Korea’s Internet was suddenly shut down for 9 h and 31 min on 22–23 December 2014 with no one claiming responsibility at that time, and it could not be proven then whether this was a counterattack by the US Government or by hacktivist groups like Anonymous which had targeted North\n\n⁸⁰ Letter dated 7 Oct. 2001 from the Permanent Rep. of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N.

    "2 Jurisdiction and Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace\n\nKorea before.⁹³ Only in July 2015 did the Director of the NSA and Commander of the US Cyber Command disclose to the public that he had advised the US President to retaliate against North Korea for the Sony hack.⁹⁴\n\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that in the context of measures of unilateral self-help, the reality is that States must make unilateral ex ante determinations with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State before responding and that such determinations may be subject to post factum review of the applicable burden of proof. States are, thus, expected to act as reasonable States objectively would in same or similar circumstances, taking into due consideration such cumulative factors as the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the evidence when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.⁹⁵\n\nOne learned author argues that the test of proving attribution for the purpose of State responsibility as explained above is out of touch with cyber reality. According to this view, “attribution asymmetry” in cyberspace makes it more difficult for the victim State to trace cyberattacks from non-State actors who are assisted by a State, while making it easier for the State behind the cyberattacks to control such attacks. This, arguably, provides an incentive for the victim State to resort to using non-State actors to counterattack the State it suspects to be behind an initial attack. A test focusing on “virtual control” is proposed instead, with the burden shifting to a State to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyberattack when that State funds and equips a non-State actor who subsequently launch a cyberattack – this is because the funding/equipping State has greater access to the relevant information concerning possible attribution of responsibility than the victim State does.⁹⁶ It would also establish a rebuttable presumption that when State infrastructure is used for a cyberattack, the State owning the infrastructure is responsible. The new test would also help ensure that the State exercise due diligence not to allow its territory, infrastructure, equipment, or funding to be used for a cyberattack against another State – and if it fails to be duly diligent this would entail State responsibility. The new test would draw upon the ICJ’s reasoning in Nicaragua v. USA where the ICJ noted that the contras continued to fight in Nicaragua even after the US Government had ended its funding to the group on 1 October 1984; hence, a rebuttable presumption that, subject to evidence to the contrary, the US was no longer in control of the contras.⁹⁷ Disassociation from non-State actors suspected of launching a cyberattack\n\n⁹³ Jo Biddle, “N. Korea’s Internet collapses after Sony hack,” AFP, 22 Dec. 2014; id., “Who cut North Korea’s Internet?,” AFP, 23 Dec. 2014.\n⁹⁴ David E.

USA Judgment. He also cited the ICTY App. Ch.

    "2.2 Attribution of State Responsibility\n\nalso shows the good faith on the part of the disassociating State.⁹⁸ It could take years to see if this proposed new test will be endorsed by State practice in relation to cyberspace. In the meantime, all the factors cited in support of the proposed new test can be taken into consideration in determining whether a cyber activity is attributable to a State pursuant to the existing international law of State responsibility.\n\nPresently, we may sometimes see the different positions/standards on attribution adopted by intelligence agencies, on the one hand, and law enforcement agencies, on the other hand. The former assess information and evidence, including circumstantial evidence and undisclosed human intelligence, to substantiate their suspicion that an entity or person is behind a cyberattack. The latter usually needs evidence that can stand up in courts of law before they can conclude who is the perpetrator of a cyberattack. This should explain the position taken by the US intelligence agencies and the initial one taken by the FBI, a US national law enforcement agency, in the aftermath of the allegations that a foreign State was behind cyber activities to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016.⁹⁹\n\nIn international relations, it is diplomatically wise and legally permissible to respond to an offensive act by another State commensurate with the level of certainty that the other State is behind the act: the more certain the evidence is, the more severe the response can be, provided that the response does not exceed the permissible bounds of international law. This will be explained in Sect. 4.7 below.\n\n## 2.2.3 Attribution and International Organizations, Such As NATO\n\nIn 2011, the ILC finished its work on the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (DARIOs),¹⁰⁰ which closely follow the ILC’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n\n⁹⁸ Libicki, Crisis, 22–23. For a similar argument, see, Constantine Antonopoulos, “State Responsibility in Cyberspace,” in Research Handbook, eds., Tsagourias and Buchan, 30–54.\n\n⁹⁹ Sam Biddle, “Here’s the Public Evidence Russia Hacked the DNC – It’s Not Enough”, Intercept, 14 Dec. 2016; Kevin Johnson, “FBI accepts CIA conclusion that Russians hacked to help Trump”, USA Today, 16 Dec. 2016.\n\nDisclosure: As of this writing, the present author was an ambassador to the Russian Federation and was, therefore, bound by diplomatic etiquette not to comment on his host State’s relations with a third State. Readers are invited to judge by themselves whether the evidence revealed by the US Government met the international law standard(s) of proof explained in this Sect. 2.2.2.

    "2 Jurisdiction and Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace\n\nArticle 3 of DARIOS stipulates: “Every international wrongful act of an international organization entails the international responsibility of that organization”.\n\nAs a general rule, attribution of responsibility between an international organization and its Member States depends on the constituent instruments, decisions, resolutions and other acts of the international organization adopted in accordance with those instruments, and established practice of the organization. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, for example, is an organization where “the fundamental internal rule governing the functioning of the organization – that of consensus decision-making – is to be found neither in the treaties establishing NATO nor in any formal rules and is, rather, the result of the practice of the organization”.¹⁰¹\n\nIn Behrami and Saramati, the European Court of Human Rights rules that as the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) led by NATO acted on the authorization of the UN Security Council, the acts complained against UNMIK and KFOR were attributable to the United Nations.¹⁰² However, the Grand Chamber of the same Court rules in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom that the UN Security Council “had neither effective control nor ultimate authority and control over the acts and omissions of foreign troops within the Multi-National Force [in Iraq] and that the applicant’s detention was not, therefore, attributable to the United Nations”; hence, the detention complained of in that case had to be attributed to the State detaining the complainant.¹⁰³\n\nAttributing to an international organization ultra vires acts taken by its organ takes is supported by international jurisprudence and practice of international organizations as well as policy considerations that “denying attribution of conduct may deprive third parties of all redresses, unless conduct could be attributable to a State or another organization”.¹⁰⁴ Draft Article 9 of DARIOs also makes it clear that conduct which is not otherwise attributable to an international organization shall nevertheless be considered an act of that organization under international law if and to the extent that the organization acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\n\nthe 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 26 Oct. 2011 (Doc.

Such jurisdiction is based on territoriality, passive personality, active personality, and protective principles to cope with the global connectivity, vulnerable technologies and anonymity in cyberspace that spans the land, sea, air and outer space domains. In order to hold a State responsible for a cyber activity, that activity must be attributed to the State in accordance with international rules on attribution for the purpose of responsibility, including the applicable standard of proof. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the controversy surrounding alleged foreign interference by cyber means in the 2016 US Presidential election show the difficult challenges for the application of these rules. International organizations can be held accountable for cyber activities attributable to them, too.",
