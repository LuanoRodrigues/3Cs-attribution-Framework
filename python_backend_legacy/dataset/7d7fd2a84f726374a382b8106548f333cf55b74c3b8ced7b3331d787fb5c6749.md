Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber-\nCyberspace and the State\npower, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³\nPopular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood ... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴\nBe this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷\nThere are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of\nCyberspace and war | 77\nwar which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n## War and indecision\n‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911:\nMan ... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹\nThe two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole\nCyberspace and the State\naround which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³\nHow similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the\nCyberspace and war | 79\nsociety of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n## Visions of future warfare\nSimilarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example,\nCyberspace and the State\nthe future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars ... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^[16]^\nIn January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars:\nConflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^[17]^\nIn respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^[18]^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century\nCyberspace and war | 81\nin describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging:\nThis is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹\nIf it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in\nCyberspace and the State\ncombination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n## Airpower redux\n‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which,\nbecause prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³\nThe parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication\nCyberspace and war | 83\nin which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵\nThe point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶\nIt is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than\nCyberspace and the State\nthe professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to\npicture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one\nCyberspace and war | 85\nvast raving Bedlam ... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹\nAlso, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart:\nA nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³\nHow similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003:\nOur nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴\nMoreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning\nCyberspace and the State\ntechnology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and\nCyberspace and war | 87\nstrategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸\nThe fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which\nCyberspace and the State\nmakes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n## Cyberwar is not coming\nAirpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it:\nAnyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of\nCyberspace and war | 89\nthe air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴\nCyberspace and the State\nThe literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors):\nOne reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along\nCyberspace and war | 91\nwith the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹\nThe idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership:\nThe phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.\nCyberspace and the State\nMiraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^[51]^\n'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^[52]^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel\nCyberspace and war | 93\nlites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other ... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^[53]^\nWhat are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^[54]^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^[55]^\nIn both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^[56]^ Can 'cyber-\nCyberspace and the State\nwar' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war:\nCombat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.[57]\nClausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful.[58] Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.[59]\nStrategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on\nCyberspace and war | 95\nthe target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61\nIt is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent\nCyberspace and the State\nthrough the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once.[63] There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised.[64] Clausewitz put it this way:\nThe first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for,\nCyberspace and war | 97\nnor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵\nThis is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.\nDownloaded by [Wake Forest University] at 07:05 04 January 2015",

Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber- Cyberspace and the State power, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³ Popular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴ Be this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷ There are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of Cyberspace and war | 77 war which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n## War and indecision ‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911: Man... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹ The two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole Cyberspace and the State around which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³ How similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the Cyberspace and war | 79 society of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n## Visions of future warfare Similarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example, Cyberspace and the State the future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^[16]^ In January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars: Conflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^[17]^ In respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^[18]^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century Cyberspace and war | 81 in describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging: This is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹ If it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in Cyberspace and the State combination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n## Airpower redux ‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which, because prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³ The parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication Cyberspace and war | 83 in which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵ The point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶ It is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than Cyberspace and the State the professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to picture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one Cyberspace and war | 85 vast raving Bedlam... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹ Also, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart: A nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³ How similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003: Our nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴ Moreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning Cyberspace and the State technology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and Cyberspace and war | 87 strategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸ The fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which Cyberspace and the State makes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n## Cyberwar is not coming Airpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it: Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of Cyberspace and war | 89 the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴ Cyberspace and the State The literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors): One reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along Cyberspace and war | 91 with the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹ The idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership: The phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.\nCyberspace and the State Miraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^[51]^ 'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^[52]^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel Cyberspace and war | 93 lites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^[53]^ What are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^[54]^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^[55]^ In both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^[56]^ Can 'cyber- Cyberspace and the State war' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war: Combat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.[57] Clausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful.[58] Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.[59] Strategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on Cyberspace and war | 95 the target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61 It is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent Cyberspace and the State through the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once.[63] There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised.[64] Clausewitz put it this way: The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, Cyberspace and war | 97 nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵ This is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.\nDownloaded by [Wake Forest University] at 07:05 04 January 2015",

    "# Cyberspace and war": "Cyberspace is without doubt one of the most thought-provoking terms in public discourse today. Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber-\nCyberspace and the State\npower, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³\nPopular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood ... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴\nBe this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷\nThere are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of\nCyberspace and war | 77\nwar which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n## War and indecision\n‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911:\nMan ... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹\nThe two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole\nCyberspace and the State\naround which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³\nHow similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the\nCyberspace and war | 79\nsociety of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n## Visions of future warfare\nSimilarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example,\nCyberspace and the State\nthe future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars ... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^^\nIn January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars:\nConflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^^\nIn respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century\nCyberspace and war | 81\nin describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging:\nThis is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹\nIf it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in\nCyberspace and the State\ncombination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n## Airpower redux\n‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which,\nbecause prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³\nThe parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication\nCyberspace and war | 83\nin which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵\nThe point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶\nIt is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than\nCyberspace and the State\nthe professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to\npicture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one\nCyberspace and war | 85\nvast raving Bedlam ... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹\nAlso, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart:\nA nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³\nHow similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003:\nOur nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴\nMoreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning\nCyberspace and the State\ntechnology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and\nCyberspace and war | 87\nstrategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸\nThe fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which\nCyberspace and the State\nmakes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n## Cyberwar is not coming\nAirpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it:\nAnyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of\nCyberspace and war | 89\nthe air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴\nCyberspace and the State\nThe literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors):\nOne reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along\nCyberspace and war | 91\nwith the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹\nThe idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership:\nThe phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.\nCyberspace and the State\nMiraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^^\n'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel\nCyberspace and war | 93\nlites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other ... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^^\nWhat are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^^\nIn both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^^ Can 'cyber-\nCyberspace and the State\nwar' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war:\nCombat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.\nClausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful. Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.\nStrategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on\nCyberspace and war | 95\nthe target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61\nIt is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent\nCyberspace and the State\nthrough the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once. There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised. Clausewitz put it this way:\nThe first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for,\nCyberspace and war | 97\nnor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵\nThis is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.\nDownloaded by [Wake Forest University] at 07:05 04 January 2015"

Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber- Cyberspace and the State power, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³ Popular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴ Be this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷ There are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of Cyberspace and war | 77 war which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n## War and indecision ‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911: Man... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹ The two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole Cyberspace and the State around which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³ How similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the Cyberspace and war | 79 society of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n## Visions of future warfare Similarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example, Cyberspace and the State the future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^[16]^ In January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars: Conflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^[17]^ In respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^[18]^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century Cyberspace and war | 81 in describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging: This is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹ If it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in Cyberspace and the State combination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n## Airpower redux ‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which, because prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³ The parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication Cyberspace and war | 83 in which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵ The point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶ It is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than Cyberspace and the State the professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to picture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one Cyberspace and war | 85 vast raving Bedlam... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹ Also, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart: A nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³ How similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003: Our nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴ Moreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning Cyberspace and the State technology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and Cyberspace and war | 87 strategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸ The fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which Cyberspace and the State makes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n## Cyberwar is not coming Airpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it: Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of Cyberspace and war | 89 the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴ Cyberspace and the State The literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors): One reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along Cyberspace and war | 91 with the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹ The idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership: The phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.\nCyberspace and the State Miraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^[51]^ 'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^[52]^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel Cyberspace and war | 93 lites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^[53]^ What are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^[54]^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^[55]^ In both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^[56]^ Can 'cyber- Cyberspace and the State war' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war: Combat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.[57] Clausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful.[58] Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.[59] Strategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on Cyberspace and war | 95 the target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61 It is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent Cyberspace and the State through the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once.[63] There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised.[64] Clausewitz put it this way: The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, Cyberspace and war | 97 nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵ This is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.\nDownloaded by [Wake Forest University] at 07:05 04 January 2015",

Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber- Cyberspace and the State power, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³ Popular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴ Be this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷ There are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of Cyberspace and war | 77 war which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n## War and indecision ‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911: Man... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹ The two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole Cyberspace and the State around which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³ How similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the Cyberspace and war | 79 society of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n## Visions of future warfare Similarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example, Cyberspace and the State the future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^[16]^ In January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars: Conflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^[17]^ In respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^[18]^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century Cyberspace and war | 81 in describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging: This is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹ If it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in Cyberspace and the State combination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n## Airpower redux ‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which, because prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³ The parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication Cyberspace and war | 83 in which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵ The point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶ It is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than Cyberspace and the State the professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to picture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one Cyberspace and war | 85 vast raving Bedlam... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹ Also, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart: A nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³ How similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003: Our nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴ Moreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning Cyberspace and the State technology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and Cyberspace and war | 87 strategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸ The fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which Cyberspace and the State makes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n## Cyberwar is not coming Airpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it: Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of Cyberspace and war | 89 the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴ Cyberspace and the State The literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors): One reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along Cyberspace and war | 91 with the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹ The idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership: The phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.\nCyberspace and the State Miraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^[51]^ 'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^[52]^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel Cyberspace and war | 93 lites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^[53]^ What are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^[54]^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^[55]^ In both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^[56]^ Can 'cyber- Cyberspace and the State war' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war: Combat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.[57] Clausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful.[58] Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.[59] Strategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on Cyberspace and war | 95 the target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61 It is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent Cyberspace and the State through the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once.[63] There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised.[64] Clausewitz put it this way: The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, Cyberspace and war | 97 nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵ This is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.\nDownloaded by [Wake Forest University] at 07:05 04 January 2015"

Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber-\nCyberspace and the State\npower, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³\nPopular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood ... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴\nBe this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷\nThere are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of\nCyberspace and war | 77\nwar which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n## War and indecision\n‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911:\nMan ... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹\nThe two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole\nCyberspace and the State\naround which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³\nHow similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the\nCyberspace and war | 79\nsociety of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n## Visions of future warfare\nSimilarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example,\nCyberspace and the State\nthe future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars ... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^^\nIn January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars:\nConflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^^\nIn respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century\nCyberspace and war | 81\nin describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging:\nThis is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹\nIf it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in\nCyberspace and the State\ncombination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n## Airpower redux\n‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which,\nbecause prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³\nThe parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication\nCyberspace and war | 83\nin which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵\nThe point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶\nIt is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than\nCyberspace and the State\nthe professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to\npicture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one\nCyberspace and war | 85\nvast raving Bedlam ... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹\nAlso, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart:\nA nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³\nHow similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003:\nOur nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴\nMoreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning\nCyberspace and the State\ntechnology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and\nCyberspace and war | 87\nstrategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸\nThe fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which\nCyberspace and the State\nmakes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n## Cyberwar is not coming\nAirpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it:\nAnyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of\nCyberspace and war | 89\nthe air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴\nCyberspace and the State\nThe literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors):\nOne reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along\nCyberspace and war | 91\nwith the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹\nThe idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership:\nThe phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.\nCyberspace and the State\nMiraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^^\n'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel\nCyberspace and war | 93\nlites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other ... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^^\nWhat are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^^\nIn both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^^ Can 'cyber-\nCyberspace and the State\nwar' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war:\nCombat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.\nClausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful. Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.\nStrategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on\nCyberspace and war | 95\nthe target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61\nIt is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent\nCyberspace and the State\nthrough the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once. There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised. Clausewitz put it this way:\nThe first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for,\nCyberspace and war | 97\nnor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵\nThis is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.\nDownloaded by [Wake Forest University] at 07:05 04 January 2015"

Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber- Cyberspace and the State power, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³ Popular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴ Be this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷ There are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of Cyberspace and war | 77 war which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n## War and indecision ‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911: Man... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹ The two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole Cyberspace and the State around which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³ How similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the Cyberspace and war | 79 society of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n## Visions of future warfare Similarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example, Cyberspace and the State the future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^[16]^ In January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars: Conflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^[17]^ In respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^[18]^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century Cyberspace and war | 81 in describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging: This is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹ If it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in Cyberspace and the State combination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n## Airpower redux ‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which, because prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³ The parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication Cyberspace and war | 83 in which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵ The point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶ It is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than Cyberspace and the State the professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to picture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one Cyberspace and war | 85 vast raving Bedlam... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹ Also, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart: A nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³ How similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003: Our nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴ Moreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning Cyberspace and the State technology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and Cyberspace and war | 87 strategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸ The fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which Cyberspace and the State makes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n## Cyberwar is not coming Airpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it: Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of Cyberspace and war | 89 the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴ Cyberspace and the State The literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors): One reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along Cyberspace and war | 91 with the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹ The idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership: The phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.\nCyberspace and the State Miraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^[51]^ 'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^[52]^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel Cyberspace and war | 93 lites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^[53]^ What are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^[54]^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^[55]^ In both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^[56]^ Can 'cyber- Cyberspace and the State war' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war: Combat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.[57] Clausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful.[58] Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.[59] Strategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on Cyberspace and war | 95 the target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61 It is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent Cyberspace and the State through the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once.[63] There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised.[64] Clausewitz put it this way: The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, Cyberspace and war | 97 nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵ This is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.\nDownloaded by [Wake Forest University] at 07:05 04 January 2015"

Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber-\nCyberspace and the State\npower, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³\nPopular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood ... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴\nBe this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷\nThere are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of\nCyberspace and war | 77\nwar which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911:\nMan ... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹\nThe two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole\nCyberspace and the State\naround which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³\nHow similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the\nCyberspace and war | 79\nsociety of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n## Visions of future warfare\nSimilarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example,\nCyberspace and the State\nthe future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars ... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^^\nIn January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars:\nConflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^^\nIn respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century\nCyberspace and war | 81\nin describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging:\nThis is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹\nIf it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in\nCyberspace and the State\ncombination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n## Airpower redux\n‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which,\nbecause prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³\nThe parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication\nCyberspace and war | 83\nin which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵\nThe point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶\nIt is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than\nCyberspace and the State\nthe professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to\npicture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one\nCyberspace and war | 85\nvast raving Bedlam ... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹\nAlso, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart:\nA nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³\nHow similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003:\nOur nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴\nMoreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning\nCyberspace and the State\ntechnology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and\nCyberspace and war | 87\nstrategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸\nThe fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which\nCyberspace and the State\nmakes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n## Cyberwar is not coming\nAirpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it:\nAnyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of\nCyberspace and war | 89\nthe air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴\nCyberspace and the State\nThe literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors):\nOne reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along\nCyberspace and war | 91\nwith the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹\nThe idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership:\nThe phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.\nCyberspace and the State\nMiraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^^\n'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel\nCyberspace and war | 93\nlites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other ... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^^\nWhat are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^^\nIn both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^^ Can 'cyber-\nCyberspace and the State\nwar' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war:\nCombat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.\nClausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful. Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.\nStrategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on\nCyberspace and war | 95\nthe target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61\nIt is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent\nCyberspace and the State\nthrough the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once. There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised. Clausewitz put it this way:\nThe first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for,\nCyberspace and war | 97\nnor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵\nThis is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.\nDownloaded by [Wake Forest University] at 07:05 04 January 2015",

Strong claims have been made both for and against its wider impact. On the one hand are those who claim that connectivity 'changes everything', perhaps even the way that humans think, our basic human nature;¹ on the other hand are those who claim that it merely enables us to do things we have always done in somewhat different ways.² The derivative term 'cyberwar' is equally evocative. But what does it actually mean for strategists concerned with the balancing of ends, ways and means in conflict today? How useful is it for understanding global trends and the future of warfare?\n\nWe can gain some insights into these issues by exploring the strategic context in which the current 'cyberwar' debate is taking place (in particular, the perceived diminishing utility of force); considering the likely shape of military cyber-power with reference to relevant historical developments and interwar airpower theory; and finally, discussing the difficulty of achieving genuine strategic effect through pure cyber-attack. The challenge here is to chart a course between the millennial and the trivial, recognising the complexities of military cyber-",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\npower, as H.G. Wells did those of airpower 100 years ago as a potentially terrible but ultimately limited weapon, ‘neither unthinkable nor blessed’.³\n\nPopular discourse on cyberwar tends to focus on the vulnerability of the ‘physical layer’ of cyberspace to cyber-attack and the ways in which this may permit even strong powers to be brought to their knees by weaker ones, perhaps bloodlessly. The Chinese strategists Qiao and Wang, authors of the much-cited future-war text *Unrestricted Warfare*, are particularly impressed by this idea: ‘The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odour of blood ... One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war.’⁴\n\nBe this as it may, it behoves us to look at the drivers of change ‘in the round’ in a strategic context and with an eye to relevant historical precedents, which a narrow focus on technology can obscure. The relevant strategic context is not merely the period since the invention of the microchip; rather it is the more-than-a-century-long period in which, for a mixture of political, economic and technological reasons, the decisiveness of major war has been diminishing.⁵ One of Clausewitz’s most valuable insights in *On War* was the distinction he drew between war’s ‘true nature’ and its ‘character’; while the latter is highly mutable (like a chameleon, as he put it), the former changes very slowly, if at all.⁶ It is reasonable to believe that the advent of military cyber-power is altering war’s character, but not that its nature is somehow being transformed also. Thucydides wrote that war arises from a complex of fear, honour and self-interest; this is no less true of war amidst the network flows of cyberspace in our day than it was amongst the isles of the Peloponnese 2,500 years ago.⁷\n\nThere are many instances in the history of war in which technological change has prompted changes in the conduct of",
    "Cyberspace and war | 77\n\nwar which we can use to illuminate the concerns of the present. Above all, there is much to be learned about the significance of military cyber-power by viewing it through the prism of the century-long debate over the benefits of airpower (its ideal and actual tactical and operational employment, optimal form of organisation, doctrine in relation to other arms, and putatively independent strategic effectiveness).\n\n## War and indecision\n\n‘War no longer exists’, claimed Rupert Smith in the first lines of his 2005 book *The Utility of Force*. ‘… War as cognitively known to most non-combatants, war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs; such war no longer exists.’⁸ Qiao and Wang would have approved. But neither was the first to make such a claim. The basic thesis of the ‘futility of force’ is actually at least 100 years old. As Norman Angell put it in *The Great Illusion* in 1911:\n\nMan ... is coming to employ physical force less because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the conclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for by other means.⁹\n\nThe two world wars showed that Angell’s faith in the rationality of mankind in the face of war’s apparent economic senselessness was misplaced at the time. Nonetheless, the belief in major war’s obsolescence has proved extremely persistent. Looking back, the two global conflicts of the twentieth century strike many as the aberration and not the norm.¹⁰ Indeed, Hew Strachan, one of the leading First World War historians and head of Oxford University’s Changing Character of Warfare programme, has argued that ‘the pole",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\naround which our ideas of war cluster should no longer be major war, itself a theoretical construct derived from the Second World War and scarcely encountered in reality since'.¹¹ Moreover, the development of thermonuclear weapons by the superpowers in the 1950s, and their subsequent proliferation among lesser states, has raised the destructive potential of major war many orders of magnitude beyond that imagined by Angell to be sufficient to dissuade leaders from seeing it as a rational tool of policy. By no means has war gone away. It continues to churn away in various forms all over the world. Rather, it is war as seen in the shaky black-and-white footage of the D-Day landings or the decisive German-Soviet Battle for Berlin which has waned.\n\nWhereas in the past wars could be made to pay (princes could add to their treasuries by conquering the lands and taking the resources of other princes), nowadays the benefits of victory are dubious at best.¹² Indeed, it is not simply that the material gains of victory are not what they used to be. In the past, a major benefit when you won the war was that you got your victorious army back in more or less one piece. Nowadays, on the other hand, we have a situation which former US Defense Secretary Colin Powell archly illustrated by using a version of the 'Pottery Barn' rule: 'you break it, you own it.' He was referring to the potential for US forces to become mired in a long, resource-sapping war that would, in his words, 'take all the oxygen out of the environment'. The British historian Sir Michael Howard put it somewhat differently, arguing that while 'the first essential' in today's wars is as it always has been, 'to target and destroy the armed forces of the enemy', beyond that, 'we must obey a military equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: do no unnecessary harm'.¹³\n\nHow similar in spirit this is to Angell's urging that 'the morality which has been by our necessities developed in the",
    "Cyberspace and war | 79\n\nsociety of individuals must also be applied to the society of nations as that society becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent'.14 In fact, there is more than a passing resemblance between the first parts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Each has witnessed ferment over the future character of warfare, which was far from resolved by the events of the First World War. Though the widespread pre-war conviction that land wars in the twentieth century would be short was shattered by four years of trench warfare, there was enormous controversy afterwards within the major armed forces of the world over how to organise, train and equip their land and naval forces to account for the technological developments in aviation, communications and armour which had emerged during the war.\n\n## Visions of future warfare\n\nSimilarly, there is today a raging debate on the likely character of future warfare which revolves around the 'correct' lessons of current conflicts for future ones: in particular, to what extent should armed forces be optimised for counter-insurgency, unconventional warfare or that even more awkward (but useful) term Military Operations Other Than War. On the one hand, 'crusaders' argue that we must adapt to winning the wars we are in, or we are doomed to defeat, wasted lives and money, and a less safe world in which the contagion of 'global insurgency' will thrive in failed and failing states. On the other hand, 'conservatives' argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are aberrations and that adapting our forces for counter-insurgency is a craven bargain, trading a first-class war-fighting army for a second-rate COIN machine.15 Policymakers in Britain and America both appear to have resolved upon a composite, 'hybrid warfare': a theory largely driven by US Marine Corps analyses which hold that, for example,",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\nthe future does not portend a suite of distinct challengers with alternative or different methods but their convergence into multi-modal or Hybrid Wars ... This could include states blending high tech capabilities, like anti-satellite weapons, with terrorism and cyberwarfare.^[16]^\n\nIn January 2010, in a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain's then Chief of General Staff, General Sir David Richards, used very nearly these same terms to describe his vision of future wars:\n\nConflict today, especially because so much of it is effectively fought through the medium of the Communications Revolution, is principally about and for People – hearts and minds on a mass scale. This is much more than just about cyber attack and defence, albeit this is important...\n\nState-on-state warfare is happening and will continue to happen, but some are failing to see how. These wars are not being fought by a conventional invasion of uniformed troops, ready to be repulsed by heavy armour or ships, but through a combination of economic, cyber and proxy actions.^[17]^\n\nIn respect of his first point, whether knowingly or otherwise, Richards echoes the conclusions of sociologist Manuel Castells that de-territorialised insurgency is the paradigmatic conflict type of the Information Age: 'The conflicts of our time are fought by networked social actors aiming to reach their constituencies and target audiences through the decisive switch to multimedia communications networks.'^[18]^ But, significantly, General Richards also evoked the early part of the twentieth century",
    "Cyberspace and war | 81\n\nin describing the current strategic and doctrinal predicament, which he characterised as being even more expansive and challenging:\n\nThis is not a change that happens once in a generation, it is less frequent than that. And in many ways this one is more fundamental than from horse to tank described by [Basil] Liddell-Hart. While that occupied the minds of generals, the present shift is one that includes our entire society and therefore impacts our whole security infrastructure.¹⁹\n\nIf it seems that we have wandered far from cyberspace, it is not for want of reason. Strategy cannot be applied to the direction and conduct of war if it starts from false premises about the nature of that war. On the whole, though, much of the debate over ‘cyberwar’ does just that: it conflates activities in cyberspace such as espionage, crime, hacking and breaches of intellectual property, which are to a greater or lesser degree threatening or annoying to society, and elevates them to the level of war, a state which society has traditionally regarded as legally, morally and strategically exceptional. This is problematic in many ways, not least from an analytical perspective, but also as a matter of practice.\n\nGrandiose talk of ‘cyberwar’ distracts us from the actual strategic context of the day, which is that described by Smith in his own way as ‘a world of confrontations and conflicts rather than one of war and peace’.²⁰ What we face is a condition of continuing hostility among diverse state and non-state actors, conducted largely by non-military means (most importantly propaganda and political agitation), sabotage and propaganda by deed, unparalleled levels of espionage both commercial and political, and crime. All of this is conducted in, through or in",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\ncombination with cyberspace. In short, talk of ‘cyberwar’ tends to ‘securitise’ a problem upon which traditional power instruments in fact have relatively little purchase.²¹ The gist is the same from Angell to Smith and Howard: major war, the rawest exercise of national power – power in the Weberian sense – for a variety of reasons, seems to have lost its place as the decisive arbiter of world events. This has vexed and confused strategists, charged as they are with connecting military means with desired political ends. However, this is not the first time that strategists have been vexed in this way.\n\n## Airpower redux\n\n‘The Web is shifting power in ways that we could never have imagined’, claimed a 2010 BBC documentary, *The Virtual Revolution*. ‘It’s providing us with new allegiances but it is also reinventing warfare.’²² Similar claims typified the interwar airpower debates in Europe and the United States. Michael Sherry, in his masterful history *The Rise of American Air Power*, describes the 1920s as a golden age of speculation about the airplane in which,\n\nbecause prophecy necessarily leaped ahead of technology, it often read like fanciful or bloodless abstractions, as if designed, like science fiction, less to depict future dangers than to express current anxieties.²³\n\nThe parallels with our own era are manifold. One of the most obvious is the language and style used. In 1923 the British strategist J.F.C. Fuller entitled his book on the shape of future wars *The Reformation of War*, a title which reflected his belief in the great transformative effect of new technology on warfare.²⁴ Also in *The Virtual Revolution*, in the context of explaining packet switching – a fundamental of digital network communication",
    "Cyberspace and war | 83\n\nin which blocks of data are transmitted via a connection that is only open for the duration of transmission – it was pointed out that ‘the data will always get through’. This phrase brings to mind Stanley Baldwin’s famous House of Commons speech in November 1932, in which he warned ‘the bomber will always get through’.²⁵\n\nThe point here is not that packets and bombers are the same, although it is a relevant metaphor in some contexts (for example, the information-security industry speaks of detecting and interdicting ‘bad packets’); but rather that both these quotations show a certain resignation: we cannot escape the ramifications of new technologies. One sees this belief too in the hacker slogan ‘information wants to be free’, which expresses the belief that technological progress is making it difficult, if not impossible, for states and other corporate entities to limit the exchange of information or restrict access to data.\n\nIn the context of this discussion of cyberspace and war, however, it is worthwhile noting the explicit equivalency drawn in the ‘cyberpunk’ sub-genre of science fiction between the damage potential of ‘information-bombing’ a society and bombing it in the traditional, high-explosive manner. For instance, in Charles Stross’s novel *Singularity Sky* a highly technologically advanced ‘transhuman’ culture subverts a less developed one by bombarding it with high-tech mobile phones which are able to grant the material wishes of their users in return for information. A recurrent theme in the novel is that information and progress are inexorable and inseparable. In the event, the contact between the lesser developed culture and the advanced one utterly devastates the societal status quo of the former.²⁶\n\nIt is easy to scoff at the musings of science-fiction authors on the future of war; but in fact their extrapolations of the future from existing trends have often been as good as or better than",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\nthe professionals’. Gibson’s Neuromancer is a case in point with respect to cyber-power.²⁷ So too in an earlier era was H.G. Wells’ 1908 novel The War in the Air, in which he painted an apocalyptic picture of the effects of airpower on a hypothetical war initiated by light German air attacks on the United States which expanded rapidly into an unwinnable, bloody global aerial conflagration. His conclusion, written just five years after the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, was that aerial warfare would be ‘at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive’.²⁸ Compare this with the musings of the professional airman and prophet of airpower Billy Mitchell who wrote of it in 1930 that it was, ‘a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years’.²⁹ Whose vision was the clearer?\n\nBut the similarities between the early airpower theorists and today’s cyber-power ones are more than merely semantic. Both, at root, are concerned with restoring decisiveness to war and see in the new technology a potential means of doing so. For the airpower theorists, writing in the shadow of the First World War which had witnessed the world’s Great Powers stalemated in a bloody quagmire of their own making, the aircraft’s ability to manoeuvre in the third dimension offered the possibility of attacking the enemy in vulnerable areas behind his surface fortifications. In the words of the famous British strategist Basil Liddell-Hart, ‘aircraft enable us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike directly and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy’.³⁰ Airpower prophets expressed the decisiveness of this new form of war in no uncertain terms. Fuller, for example, invited readers of The Reformation of War to\n\npicture, if you can, what the result [of a mass aerial attack] will be: London for several days will be one",
    "Cyberspace and war | 85\n\nvast raving Bedlam ... the enemy will dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be fought in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!³¹\n\nAlso, as with cyber-power theorists today, the certitude of airpower theorists about the puissance of aerial bombing rested as much upon an acute sense of the fragility of modern industrial society as it did upon the inherent strength of bombers carrying high explosives, gas and incendiaries. In the 1920s and 1930s there was profound worry in Europe that the economic achievements in which they had gloried, their industrial power, the material and cultural wealth of their societies, had also made them hopelessly vulnerable to attack on the home front.³² Consider the language of Liddell-Hart:\n\nA nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.³³\n\nHow similar this is to the apprehensions apparent in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003:\n\nOur nation's critical infrastructures are composed of [a very long list of assets beginning with 'public and private institutions' and ending with 'postal and shipping']. Cyberspace is their nervous system – the control system of our country.³⁴\n\nMoreover, as with airpower then and cyber-power now, a complicating factor is the intertwining of the underpinning",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\ntechnology with other areas of the economy and political and cultural enterprise. The airplane was never merely an instrument of war; it was also a tool of commerce and a fulfilment of the eternal human longing to fly.\n\nAs Sherry put it, ‘aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a “holy cause”, and with religious fervour they outlined its potential to democratise, uplift and pacify the nations that touched it’.³⁵ Almost exactly the same thing can be seen with cyberspace and its constituent technologies, which are also essentially civilian. Nations consider the sophistication of their digital infrastructure to be integral to the advancement of their prosperity; countries are pumping public and private funds into ever increasing the speed and bandwidth of their digital networks, and in some places monitoring and controlling what their citizens decide to do with this communication power. Which country possesses the world’s fastest computer matters as much to policymakers now as which country possessed the fastest or longest-range aircraft in the interwar period, and for the same reason. They are thought to be indicative of military potential as well as prestige.\n\nWhat was true of airpower need not necessarily be true of military cyber-power. It is generally accepted that in the Industrial Age industrial power largely determined military power. Whether the same correlation exists in the Information Age between the dominant mode of production and military power remains to be seen. The key is probably not the mode of power, but rather the object of its exertion: if the object is the overthrow of one’s enemy, rendering him powerless to resist, then military cyber-power is a multiplier of physical force, not a substitute for it, because of the special relationship between industrial power and strategic decisiveness. If, alternatively, the object of putative ‘cyberwar’ is persuasion, then we might posit some special relationship between cyber-power and",
    "Cyberspace and war | 87\n\nstrategic decisiveness. The American International Relations scholar who coined the concept of ‘soft power’, Joseph Nye, neatly encapsulates this logic: ‘in the Information Age, it’s not just whose army wins, but whose story wins’.³⁶ There is no doubt that such thinking has captured the attention of Western armed forces, to judge from the recent outpouring of new doctrine on ‘strategic communications’, ‘influence’ and ‘information operations’. The truth, however, is that we do not know because it has not yet been put to the test; moreover, even if (as may well be the case) Nye is correct, how much sense does it make to locate the ‘test’ in the conceptual framework of war?\n\nFor our purposes, however, if there are lessons to be learned for military cyber-power from considering the debate over airpower, perhaps the most germane is that both the threats and the opportunities presented by the new technology have a tendency to be oversold and exaggerated by its ‘early adopters’. And hence there is good cause to worry that cyber-power theorists are repeating an old mistake: succumbing to the ‘shock of the new’ where more cool-headed analysis would urge caution and more reflection on the elements of continuity than those of change. Again, as Sherry observed wryly of early airpower theorists, ‘air prophets were not invariably systematic thinkers’.³⁷ Their exhausting precision about the vulnerabilities of the modern nation-state – what today’s cyber literature describes as ‘critical national infrastructure’ – was matched by an exasperating vagueness about how defeat would follow from their destruction. Even today, as Eliot Cohen, professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, has argued, ‘air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without commitment’.³⁸\n\nThe fundamental characteristics of airpower are said to be: speed – a function of the lack of obstacles in airspace, which",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\nmakes airpower highly responsive; range – a function of the ubiquity of the atmosphere which means airpower is highly mobile; and, elevation – a function of the depth of the airspace which means airpower possesses a wide perspective on the conflict below. Cyber-power appears to offer similar things, only more so, which perhaps explains why it has been enthusiastically embraced by air forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Moreover, it offers something else which airpower does not: anonymity, a function of the architecture of cyberspace.³⁹ This attribute is alarming and alluring in equal measure, because it seems to offer some potential for restoring elusive decision; if the identity of an attacker via cyberspace is unknown, then retaliation is difficult, and perhaps, therefore, the escalation of hostilities, which has largely deterred major war since 1945, might not be effective. In short, cyber-power is even more seductive than airpower, in part because it appears to offer gratification without the need of any physical connection (let alone commitment) to other human beings whatsoever.\n\n## Cyberwar is not coming\n\nAirpower has never lived up to the dreams of its most enthusiastic advocates. This is not to deny the enormous contribution it has made to modern warfare. Indeed, virtually unchallenged air supremacy has become more or less the sine qua non of the Western ‘way of war’. This is an undeniable advantage in conventional war, as no one understands better than a commander who has tried to fight while on the wrong end of an airpower asymmetry. As General Erwin Rommel, whose tanks, troops and artillery were mercilessly pummelled by Allied aircraft in the battle for France in 1944, put it:\n\nAnyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of",
    "Cyberspace and war | 89\n\nthe air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\n\nIt is entirely possible that an army of the twenty-first century that attempts to fight without an umbrella of military cyber-power against an enemy equipped with this capability will suffer as did Rommel's panzers, notwithstanding their tactical acumen, esprit de corps and the sophistication of their other weapons.⁴⁰ It is rather the failure to achieve the independent war-winning effects – winning the war in 48 hours with nil casualties on the victorious side, as Fuller imagined – which has failed.\n\nIt is unnecessary, however, to recapitulate here the ‘great airpower debate’ which has been dealt with cogently elsewhere.⁴¹ Rather, what is useful to extract from the debate is that while military cyber-power is likely to be efficacious, it will not be so in itself. Claims, such as that of the 1994 American commission on protecting national infrastructure, that ‘this technology is capable of deciding the outcome of geopolitical crises without the firing of a single weapon’, ought to be greeted sceptically.⁴² Nor should we single out airpower particularly; it is merely a fine example of a more general hope, perfectly encapsulated above, which may be seen in all the armed services to a greater or lesser degree, that despite the lessons of history, advanced technology can overcome the unpredictable and uncertain nature of war. The promise of Network-Centric Warfare, Effects-Based Warfare, and similar derivative concepts of the Revolution in Military Affairs – popular theories of the 1990s – withered in the cruel realities of the wars that followed 11 September 2001.⁴³ Technology cannot make up for all the weaknesses of strategy; often what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other.⁴⁴",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\nThe literature on strategy is far from insensitive to the double-edged nature of information technology. The state of warfare today is a source of anxiety to those who fight, plan and develop policy for it, because it is much more difficult and complex than was anticipated in the heady days after the end of the Cold War, when some believed in a permanent triumph of liberal democracy and market capitalism (and from which point Western military forces would triumph easily and cheaply over less sophisticated enemies).45 For the major armies of the world, formed by the conventions of the Industrial Age, twenty-first-century conflict seems unfathomably complex.46 Invocations of ‘cyberwar’ thus tend to make matters yet more complex. Perhaps the most persistent concern voiced by those who write of ‘cyberwar’ is the idea that it deepens asymmetries of power between strong states and weaker states, and between all states and some ‘super-empowered’ non-state actors.47 As James Adams concluded his 1998 book *The Next World War*, one of the earliest popular treatments on the subject, ‘as David proved against Goliath, strength can be beaten. America today looks uncomfortably like Goliath, arrogant in its power, armed to the teeth, ignorant of its weakness.’48 Adams goes to the heart of the matter: the fear on the part of ‘Goliath’ states that they are vulnerable to a debilitating attack by a lesser-armed adversary, who certainly could not tackle them on their own terms. Strategists are also alert to the disruptive potential of cyberspace in changing the balance of power between the United States and its ‘near-peer’ competitors (as well as non-state actors):\n\nOne reason for the imminent and broad-based nature of the cyberspace challenge is the low buy-in cost compared to the vastly more complex and expensive appurtenances of air and space warfare, along",
    "Cyberspace and war | 91\n\nwith the growing ability of present and prospective Lilliputian adversaries to generate what one expert called ‘catastrophic cascading effects’ through asymmetric operations against the American Gulliver.⁴⁹\n\nThe idea is undeniably a useful rhetorical device, as is the regular invocation of a looming ‘electronic Pearl Harbor’.⁵⁰ Adams described a hypothetical ‘cyberwar’ between China and the United States conducted by what he called ‘War by Other Means’. The scenario rested on the now familiar premise that the computers controlling China’s industrial, communications and public utilities systems, its ‘nervous system’, had been infected during installation, by Western manufacturers, with trojans, which effectively turned over their control to the Americans from a distance. In this hypothetical conflict a Chinese fleet was steaming to the Malacca straits in order to assert territorial claims there which the United States wished to prevent by some other means than sinking it. At its climax, once American cyberwarriors hijack control of Chinese hydropower production and communications facilities in order to cause gradual ‘catastrophic cascading’ effects on their agriculture and industry, the reality dawns on the Chinese leadership:\n\nThe phone in front of the General Secretary rang. The President offered his condolences on the unfolding agricultural crisis in the Yangtze valley, and said if China needed help, the people of the United States stood ready to do what they could.\n\nMystified, the General Secretary thanked the President, and then hung up. With internal communications dead, he had no idea what the President had been talking about.",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\nMiraculously, phone service between the Yangtze region and Beijing was restored, and the grim news of the breakdown at the dam was relayed to the Politburo.\n\nThe General Secretary quickly understood that he was not in as much control of his nation as he had thought. He ordered the Malacca-bound battle group home.^[51]^\n\n'War by Other Means' in this imagining is almost wholly electronic, bloodless and decisive, one might say the very epitome of Liddell-Hart's 'indirect approach' – or indeed of Sun Tzu's famous aphorism about the acme of military skill being to subdue one's enemy without fighting.^[52]^ Another fictitious scenario, written by Richard Clarke, paints a slightly different picture of a hypothetical 'cyberwar' between the United States and an unknown attacker.\n\nWithin a quarter of an hour, 157 major metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide blackout hitting during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting towards Wilmington and Houston. Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centres being wiped out. Weather, navigation and communications satel",
    "Cyberspace and war | 93\n\nlites are spinning out of their orbits into space. And the US military is a series of isolated units struggling to communicate with each other ... In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this country.^[53]^\n\nWhat are the key differences between the two scenarios? On a number of levels Clarke's vision seems the more plausible. For one thing, it is far from bloodless. Lots of Americans are killed, as indeed one expects many Chinese would be killed if the life-support mechanisms of their economy and society were shut down. Clausewitz, who reckoned those who sought 'some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed' to be fantasists, would have approved.^[54]^ For another, whereas in Adams's tale Chinese electronic systems are disrupted by trojans placed in the hardware by Western parts manufacturers, in Clarke's the shoe is on the other foot. This makes much sense given Chinese dominance now in the manufacture of computer hardware and devices specifically; and more generally given that open societies such as the United States have promiscuously networked their systems in ways that make it very difficult to disconnect from the Internet, whereas the 'Great Firewall of China' and other measures taken by China to restrict the physical entry points of the Internet arguably make it more cyber-defensible.^[55]^\n\nIn both scenarios the attack is strategically decisive: the electronic attack actually disarms the target state. As we have seen, many find this plausible; yet experts such as Martin Libicki warn that the possibilities of 'hostile conquest' in cyberspace 'may be less consequential than meets the eye'.^[56]^ Can 'cyber-",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\nwar' without actual or threatened violence be war? According to Clausewitz, the act of fighting is fundamental to war:\n\nCombat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.[57]\n\nClausewitz was, of course, a creature of his time, which long predated electrical devices, let alone cyberspace. Let us, therefore, allow for purposes of argument that the 'abutment' upon which war plans are based, the destruction of the enemy's forces which he imagined requiring physical battle, could also be achieved digitally. Tactically, in essence, armies need to do some basic things – move, shoot and sustain forces – for which communications provides the means of coordination; it is plausible that cyber-attacks could degrade the coordinative role of communications to the point that the basic combat functions could not be performed adequately. Strategically, given the ever-increasing scale and consequence of cyberspace in daily life, it is not an unreasonable supposition that attacks upon digital systems could be very painful.[58] Even then, however, there remains a problem in accepting its independent strategic effect: to whom does the victim of an anonymous cyber attack make 'cash payment'? As Clarke concludes his scenario, 'in cyber war, we may never even know what hit us'.[59]\n\nStrategically, the problem here is not merely for the victim, in identifying against whom to retaliate, it is equally a problem for the aggressor, who must ask 'how do I impose my will on",
    "Cyberspace and war | 95\n\nthe target of attack if I disclose neither what that will is nor my identity?' In terms of strategy, Adams's hypothetical conflict is more plausible, because at least in that instance the Chinese president is under no misapprehension about whose thumb he is under and the course of action he must undertake to remove that pressure. This is not to diminish the 'attribution problem' which is quite obviously exploited by hackers and criminals who, according to the USAF doctrine on Cyberspace Operations, constantly 'amaze those in global law enforcement with the speed at which they stay one step ahead in the technology race'.60 It is to suggest that the attribution problem is really something which pertains primarily to espionage and crime, where goals may be achieved anonymously and much less so to war which, to be a rational tool of policy, ultimately must be clear about what that policy is.\n\nThe false allure of 'cyberwar' lies in the notion that it provides a sneaky way to return a decisiveness to major war which, as noted above, it has lacked for many years. But when states use military cyber-power against other states for the purposes of compelling them to do their will, they still have to declare what it is (even if after the event). There is no sneaky way around this fact. If China were to kill several thousand Americans, or vice versa, and profoundly disrupt the lives of many millions of others through cyber-attack in an attempt to bend the rival government to its will, then the prefix cyber- would be superfluous to the requirement of describing the state of relations which would exist between the two countries. 'Cyberwar' as a 'pure play' option for states is unrealistic, because of the expanse and diversity of their interests and capabilities.61\n\nIt is worth recalling that the seminal 1993 article by Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!', which set off this debate, was essentially tactical in orientation.62 It was a vision of moving and shooting more adroitly than your opponent",
    "Cyberspace and the State\n\nthrough the employment of better information systems. It was about knowledge as power in a very literal and immediate sense. Moreover, the inspiration for their vision of war was not, as might be supposed, the precision technology of the 1991 Gulf War but the brilliant tactics of the world-conquering 13th century Mongol empire. To reiterate, what is of interest here is not the technology per se; rather it is what can be done with that technology. In this case, what cyberspace does is to allow armed forces to move information around in ways that, all things being equal, can deliver it a significant battlefield advantage. Military cyber-power is a real and important complement to other military capabilities. It does not, as airpower did not, obviate those capabilities or change the objective nature of war.\n\nMilitary cyber-power is not as strategically potent as it has been made out to be. There is good reason to think that, like airpower, it will constitute a vital element of future combined operations; but 'cyberwar' in the sense of a strategically decisive form of interstate warfare is a confusing and pointless distraction. Western governments, perhaps more so in the United Kingdom than the United States, seem to understand this, to judge from the speech by GCHQ head Iain Lobban to the IISS in late 2010, which emphasised the contribution of cybersecurity to economic vitality while mentioning 'cyberwar' not even once.[63] There is a growing suspicion of the cyber threat being over-hyped (by experts and companies with a vested interest in selling services to defeat it) that ought to be heeded because the threats need to be carefully contextualised.[64] Clausewitz put it this way:\n\nThe first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for,",
    "Cyberspace and war | 97\n\nnor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.⁶⁵\n\nThis is good advice. But perhaps the most decisive judgement is to realise that the correct frame of reference for Information Age conflict is not ‘pure play’ state-on-state ‘cyberwar’ in which strategic objectives may be met through cyber coups de main on their own. The correct frame is ‘cyber-skirmish’, a more or less constant hum of low-level activity over a wide ‘virtual landscape’, often conducted by irregular actors, with few or no single engagements of strategic consequence, however weighty in aggregate the stakes may be. And indeed the stakes in aggregate – that is to say in terms of the smooth functioning of the overarching international order – are significant.",
