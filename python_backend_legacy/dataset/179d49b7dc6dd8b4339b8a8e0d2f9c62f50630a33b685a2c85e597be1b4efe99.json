Fourth, there is an underdeveloped legal framework to guide response.¹\n\nThere is currently no international, legally binding instrument that would address cyberspace attacks as threats to national security.²\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nChange has come and gone. While academics have been discussing methods to define the use of force in cyberspace, governments and policy makers may have missed an opportunity to shape the law of war. Just like a child “pinching” a peppermint from the candy store while the owner was not looking, someone may have successfully launched two cyberspace attacks, and no one called either one an unlawful use of force or armed attack. Did a state actor set a precedent that could become part of customary international law?\n\nEvery day there are new stories and developments about the increasing connectivity of people around the world spurred by the continued fast pace of technological developments in the computer and communications industries. Military applications of cyberspace are also rapidly evolving, moving the domain of cyberspace to the front lines of conflicts. But, the legal frameworks that regulate war or armed conflict are lagging far behind the technological changes that have already occurred. Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light. Unfortunately, law, especially international law, failed to keep pace with the new applications of existing technologies.³ On the criminal front, law enforcement agencies are swamped with allegations ranging from identity theft to theft of corporate data, while armed with only a marginally effective process to investigate, extradite, and prosecute international cyberspace criminals. However, the conduct of military operations in and through cyberspace, with potentially greater global implications, is bypassing the currently inadequate mire of international law. What if international law could provide a framework capable of enabling deterrence in cyberspace?\n\n¹ U.S.-CHINA ECON. &amp; SEC.

The unique qualities of operations in cyberspace will make this the most difficult domain in which to resolve international disputes and conflict. In this article, I intend to offer a new methodology for determining armed attacks in cyberspace by using existing criminal law legal tools. Specifically, this methodology will borrow from the criminal law’s definitions of cyberspace crimes, in order to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon. More importantly, by defining cyberspace weapon, this methodology will enable the international community to define what constitutes a cyberspace attack. Providing the legal framework for a definition of cyberspace attack, such as the new methodology outlined in this article, will serve to reduce the potential for conflict in cyberspace.\n\nThe article will first examine cyberspace and how current approaches have attempted to apply international law to armed attacks in cyberspace. Looking through the lens of current international laws will highlight how the unique attributes of cyberspace could increase the likelihood of international conflict. The article will identify how the failure of international law to define armed attacks and weapons further exacerbates this problem. The article will then transition from current international laws to examine whether current criminal law definitions and methodologies can fill the gap and provide realistic definitions of weapons and armed attacks in cyberspace. Lastly, the article will put these proposed definitions to the test against the most challenging aspects of cyberspace: attribution and espionage.\n\n⁴ See, e.g., Michael N.

What is Cyberspace?\n\nFor the purposes of this article, I define cyberspace as *an evolving man-made domain for the organization and transfer of data using various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The domain is a combination of private and public property governed by technical rule sets designed primarily to facilitate the flow of information.*⁵ The key feature of cyberspace is that it is a man-made domain designed to transfer data and information.\n\nInformation is the reason cyberspace exists, and this feature makes current discussions involving the international law of conflict management, *jus ad bellum*, so different from traditional *jus ad bellum* discussions. Simply put, information is fundamentally different than the traditional tools of war; bits and bytes bear no physical resemblance to bullets and bombs. Michael Schmitt noted that cyberspace threats differ in four ways from traditional threats: (1) computer networks are a new target category, with computer network attacks capable of providing the same results as striking the traditional target with a kinetic weapon; (2) an attack does not have to use kinetic force and can solely involve a command from one computer to the target system; (3) the intended results are often not kinetic and could simply involve the manipulation of data or disruption of a service; and (4) cyberspace threats are not constrained by political boundaries or geography.⁶\n\nI would add four more distinguishing factors between cyberspace threats and traditional or kinetic uses of force: (1) cyberspace attacks can be completed literally at the speed of light; (2) the results of some cyberspace attacks, whether intended or not, can be similar to those involving weapons of mass destruction;⁷ (3) the cost of acquiring the equipment and expertise to conduct operations in\n\n---\n\n⁵ This definition was developed jointly with my cyberspace law cohort, Major Noah Bledstein at 8 AF/JA. Major Bledstein has been working on cyberspace law issues since 2003. His assistance in discussing and developing the ideas and definitions in this paper was invaluable. It does not specifically address the issue of whether some part or all of cyberspace should be considered a global commons.\n\n⁶ Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, supra note 4, at 888.\n\n⁷ Because the infrastructure of modern societies relies on the technology and data which can be easily targeted during a cyberspace operation, the disabling of such infrastructure or manipulation of data could cause substantial damage and harm to a society. For example: disabling air traffic control systems or the systems which control the water flowing from a large dam, manipulating the data relied upon by banks or the International Monetary Fund, or manipulating the DNA coding for the subsequent year’s flu vaccine.",

In fact, the attribution problem makes cyberspace so different from other mediums or domains that it requires an entirely new international law approach. The unique nature of the cyber domain impacts not only national level decisions but also the development of law in this area, as evidenced by the current state of law regarding cyberspace and conflict management, which is discussed below.\n\n## B. Current Legal Approaches to Cyberspace Attacks\n\nThe majority of scholars considering attacks in cyberspace have used an ambiguous, effects-based analytical approach relying on international law to determine what constitutes a “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter or whether an “armed attack” occurred under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.⁹ The discussions and articles have also looked to other treaties that comprise international law and the law of war, such as the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions. On first impression, an effects-based approach to the issue that relies on\n\n⁸ A nuance of limited attribution is that much of the public is unaware of what is going on in cyberspace. In the other domains where military operations are conducted, the activities are much more visible. However, in cyberspace, we can’t easily spot electrons and data packets whisking by us or through a phone line.\n\n⁹ *See supra* note 4. A brief description of two of the leading approaches follows: First, Gary Sharp’s approach recognizes that a use of force in cyberspace may rise to the threshold of an armed attack, depending on its “scope, duration, and intensity,” which are factors previously relied upon by the United States (*See infra* note 28). Mr. Sharp suggests relying upon an analysis of how states have responded in previous cases to help analyze whether an unlawful use of force or armed attack have occurred, essentially relying on a normative analysis. Mr. Sharp summarizes his test by stating: “What constitutes a use of force of a scope, duration, and intensity that constitutes an armed attack and triggers the law of armed conflict is a question of fact that must be subjectively analyzed in each and every case in the context of all relevant law and circumstances.” SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 69. Michael Schmitt’s analytical approach involves six factors which are used to “délimit” economic/political coercion from determining what is a use of armed force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Mr. Schmitt’s premise for using an effects based approach primarily rests with his assessment that the U.N. Charter was not directly focused on outlawing “force” but rather the “deleterious consequences” of state actions, and outlawing uses of force under Article 2 was a “prescriptive short-hand to achieve their goals.” Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, *supra* note 4, at 911. I would recommend that all practitioners in this area read both works. Mr. Sharp’s book is especially invaluable as a thorough review of international law that applies to cyberspace operations.\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 69",

The actors certainly focus on what effects they can achieve in and through cyberspace. These effects-based approaches add considerable value to the discussion of the issue, but they are unnecessarily constrained by relying primarily on legal documents and customary international norms developed before the advent of mass-produced computers.\n\nThe only substantial international legal document developed to address issues related to cyberspace is the European Union's Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰ (Cybercrime Convention). While the Cybercrime Convention does not address cyberspace attacks as possible acts of war and instead focuses on criminal acts, it does help establish a framework for a new methodology of analyzing cyberspace attacks. Instead of focusing on the end result of a cyberspace event, the effects, and trying to determine whether such an act is a use of force or armed attack under international law, a criminal law methodology places increased emphasis on the genesis of a cyberspace event. The criminal law approach thus focuses on defining the beginning of a cyberspace event and not the effects, and those definitions can then be applied to international law and military operations in cyberspace.\n\nBefore discussing the benefits of the criminal law approach, however, one must first understand how most commentators are currently applying international law to actions in cyberspace. A review of current scholarship on this issue will show the difficulty in applying decades old terms and norms to actions in cyberspace. As a starting point, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”¹¹\n\nHowever, without international sanctions there is little incentive for a party to comply with Article 2(4)’s peaceful objectives.¹² The\n\n¹⁰ Convention on Cybercrime, Nov. 23, 2001, 2296 U.N.T.S. 167, available at http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm.\n¹¹ U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4\n¹² Id. Art. 1 of the Charter states the purpose of the Charter. Subparagraph 1 specifically states:\n\nTo maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.\n\n70 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

            "markdown": "historical reality is that most state actors have not conducted themselves as though they feared some form of international punishment for their actions. By itself, Article 2(4) seems, therefore, to create very little deterrent effect in conflict management.\n\nHowever, in contrast to Article 2(4), Article 51 permits parties to act in self-defense in response to an “armed attack.”¹³ Pragmatically, this right of self-defense can have the quickest success at reducing illegal uses of force constituting breaches of the peace, thereby increasing the deterrent effect of international law.¹⁴ While it is important to analyze whether a state action is a threat or use of force, the more critical question is whether the action is an armed attack, authorizing the recipient to respond in self-defense? The right of self-defense puts other states on notice that their offensive actions could be met with military force.\n\nThe right of self-defense has historically been limited by the reality that smaller nation states would respond against bigger and more powerful states with conventional force only if an attack truly jeopardized its national survival.¹⁵ This could be called the “bully dilemma” of international law.¹⁶ The “bully dilemma” pragmatically disenfranchises smaller and weaker states from the protection of Article 51. If a “bully” state engages in a small-scale breach of the peace against a significantly smaller state that smaller state will likely\n\n¹³ Mr. Sharp reasons “a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), however, the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.” Mr. Sharp recognizes that his position may not be held by all and that any right of self-defense is limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity. SHARP, supra note 4, at 48-49.\n\n¹⁴ When there is a threat or use of force under Article 2, the United Nations can impose sanctions, to include armed intervention under Chapter 7. However, building the consensus for such actions often takes considerable time and debate, while the victims of such use of force wait for relief. Even the liberation of Kuwait took more than six months before U.N. authorized forces began significant operations to remove Iraqi forces.\n\n¹⁵ For example, when the United States launched cruise missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan in August 1998, neither country responded with conventional force. The codename for the operation was “Infinite Reach.” What if Sudan had then possessed a capability to respond in cyberspace? How could Sudan respond in cyberspace, and would the U.S. have countered, if attribution could be obtained?\n\n¹⁶ Mr. Sharp, on page 52 of CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE, supra note 4, concluded the third chapter of his book by stating “[t]here is no black and white, mechanical rule in the law of conflict management that clearly defines what a use of force is under all circumstances.” He then followed that statement by using the opposite of the “bully dilemma” to demonstrate his conclusion that a use of force is a question of fact which must be subjectively analyzed: “For example, a state’s activity that is lawful against another state of equal size may nevertheless be significant enough against a smaller state to cross Article 2(4)’s ‘political independence’ threshold.” A subjective “size matters” approach to law provides no clarity and leaves smaller states wondering whether they can seek international assistance or defend themselves.\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 71",

Meanwhile, as noted above, sanctions under the U.N. Charter are rarely invoked against the “bully” state, especially when the “bully” state is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and therefore holds a veto.\n\nHowever, in contrast to the historical “bully dilemma,” as depicted above, the asymmetric nature of operations in cyberspace now allows any party to possess the capability to swiftly act in self-defense with incredible lethality. The “bully” could soon be extinct and a new era of conflict could unfold, where the appearance of parity could inspire more breaches of the peace.¹⁷ This is why the development of law in this area must move forward.\n\n## C. Looking to Jus in Bello to Define Armed Attack\n\nThe potential lethality of cyberspace responses and unique attributes of cyberspace should compel international lawyers to consider the right of self-defense against cyberspace attacks in light of both the *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum*. Beginning with *jus in bello*, the focus of the examination is whether the current laws and definitions provide sufficient clarity to help nation states resolve what is an armed attack in cyberspace. Unfortunately, international law fails to define “armed attack”. The Geneva Conventions and additional documents relating to the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), *jus in bello*, do provide definitions of related terms that can clarify what international law would likely consider an armed attack. The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols are “not a separate paradigm of conflict management,” but are focused on *jus in bello* issues.¹⁸\n\nArticle 49 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I) defines “attack” as “acts of violence against the\n\n¹⁷ To use a college football analogy, the spread of the “West Coast Offense” to many universities has resulted in non-traditional powerhouse programs rising up and defeating Goliaths of the gridiron. Boise State University’s BCS victory over the University of Oklahoma highlights how smaller teams with allegedly lower quality recruits can use a new method of attack to level the playing field. In cyberspace operations, what is to stop a small nation state from responding with a non-attributable cyberspace operation in response to perceived threats or incursions by a “bullying” superpower? Even if the smaller state is questioned, it could respond that it is acting in self-defense to what it considered an armed attack with necessary actions to protect it from further harm. Such an asymmetric shift in warfare could result in an increasing number of “cyberspace conflicts” much like the low intensity conflicts of the 1980s. However, the capacity for “cyberspace conflicts” to rapidly escalate in lethality, due to self-defense actions, could be an incentive for nation states to instead look for a model that promotes deterrence.\n\n¹⁸ SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 77.\n\n72 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.\n\n*Id.* International law recognizes distinctions with regard to conducting hostilities in the domains of air and sea, yet there is no strong movement for international recognition of the distinctive qualities of the domain of cyberspace.\n\n²⁰ Commentary for Protocol I, art. 49, para. 1882, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=470&amp;t=com.\n\n²¹ Even in 1977, international law failed to grasp the importance of economic battles that could bring a country to its knees.\n\n²² The four Geneva Conventions were signed on 12 August 1949.

The Commentary language begs the question—a question not answered—what is “intervention of the armed forces?”\n\nIn sum, this discussion of the Geneva Conventions as they relate to *jus in bello* reveals that “armed conflict” is an activity that involves acts of violence between armed forces, which affect at least one person, regardless of the amount of damage or suffering inflicted. Overall, the threshold is quite low and certainly does not require significant damage or loss of life. The policy concern to protect people from the harsh effects of conflict most likely inspired such a low, almost bright-line approach. While the definitions and Official Commentaries of the Conventions help explore the issue, the U.N. Charter remains the principal document for analyzing *jus ad bellum* issues relevant to the armed attack determination.\n\n## D. Armed Attack and Jus ad Bellum\n\nUnfortunately, the U.N. Charter itself provides very little by way of definition when it comes to the term, “armed attack.” Moreover, no official commentary addresses the issue. However, one place scholars have turned for clarification is the U.N. General Assembly’s 1974 resolution defining aggression, Resolution Number 3314. In that resolution, the General Assembly defined aggression as the “use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or\n\nConvention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12 1949, provides the following minor distinction:\n\nIt makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces; it suffices for the armed forces of one Power to have captured adversaries falling within the scope of Article 4. Even if there has been no fighting, the fact that persons covered by the Convention are detained is sufficient for its application. The number of persons captured in such circumstances is, of course, immaterial.\n\nParagraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War simply clarifies with regard to civilians that the “respect due to the human person as such is not measured by the number of victims.”\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 75",

Unfortunately, subjective conclusions do not add much clarity to resolving what acts would be considered an armed attack in cyberspace. As noted above, such definitional clarity is essential to aiding all states in understanding which acts in cyberspace can result in self-defense actions.

When a Navy A-6 crew was shot down over Syria in 1983 and one of the crew members was captured, the U.S. claimed POW status for Lt Goodman and stated that “‘armed conflict’ includes any situation in which there is hostile action between the armed forces of two parties, regardless of the duration, intensity or scope of the fighting.” (emphasis added by this author) This is contrasted with the later U.S. position regarding the status of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant as an unlawful detainee, since the U.N. operations in Somalia “did not rise to the level of de facto international armed conflict.” SHARP, supra note 4, at 61-62. Essentially, Mr. Sharp’s position is that the U.S. position has evolved and now relies on the conjunctive “and” when applying the three factors of scope, duration, and intensity, versus the disjunctive “or.”\n\n76 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

Charter and Common Article 2 framework, there appears to be no clear answer in contemporary international law. Mr. Sharp, quoting Ian Brownlie, attempted to illustrate how international law can be applied during an international incident: “the minor nature of an attack” helps to prove the “intention to attack, of honest mistake, or simply the limited objectives of an attack.”²⁹ Brownlie’s observation made sense in the days of conventional weapons and minor border skirmishes or incursions. One or two shots fired by a border guard versus dropping two 1,000 pound bombs can circumstantially help determine intent. Generally, with such kinetic attacks, the first or second order effects are readily discernable. However, warfare has changed and a new domain has evolved.\n\nIn cyberspace, what may appear as a “minor attack” could evolve into something much more destructive to a nation state, taking days or months to cause observable, significant harm. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks, and cyberspace attacks are quite different from the traditional methods of massing forces and building up logistics trains and lines of communication. States can much more easily identify preparation for a kinetic invasion versus a cyberspace onslaught. Asymmetric warfare may require asymmetric application of the law to provide the clarity and enforceability capable of promoting peace. The development of international law related to activities in cyberspace should not be delayed any longer.³⁰\n\nAnd why is finding a legally clear answer so difficult? In his writing, Sharp recognizes the concerns with a strict interpretation of Common Article 2, since such a “rote” application of the Article 2 threshold “intentionally causes military personnel to become belligerents and lawful targets even though they are conducting a peacetime military operation.”³¹ Sharp’s concern regarding a strict\n\n²⁸ Recall the conclusion of supra note 17 regarding how the asymmetric nature of cyberspace warfare could result in an increasing number of conflicts, all with the potential of having substantially greater effects than traditional low intensity conflicts. This asymmetric nature has created a potential deterrence vacuum, which the law must attempt to fill and states must then enforce.\n\n²⁹ SHARP, supra note 4, at 66 (quoting IAN BROWNLEIE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES, 366 (1954)).\n\n³⁰ I refer the reader to the two lead-off quotes at the beginning of this article.

There has been no move to create a U.N. “cyberspace peacekeeping force” to engage in online actions to enforce U.N. resolutions or sanctions, and cyberspace forces are not conducting humanitarian missions. In addition, neither Common Article 2, the U.N. Charter, nor the U.N. definition of aggression are contemporary enough to be strictly applied to activities in cyberspace, since they lack definitions applicable to the unique methods used in cyberspace operations. Nevertheless, the policy objective and low threshold of Common Article 2 provide hope that international law is capable of applying a stricter, definition-based approach to cyberspace attacks. The need for a legally clear answer should help shift the focus from an ambiguous, effects-based approach that relies solely on international law to the development of a definition-based approach capable of consistent application to cyberspace operations that affect other states.\n\n## E. Weapons are the Key\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly’s defined aggression to include the use of “any weapons” against another state. The use of such a clearly broad term as “any” logically implies that the use of even minor weapons against a state could be considered an act of aggression, if the circumstances are of “sufficient gravity.” Leaving aside the inevitably ambiguous discussion of events that may be of “sufficient gravity” in the eyes of the U.N. General Assembly, the General Assembly’s inclusion of the use of weapons in its definition of aggression brings the discussion regarding armed attacks in cyberspace back to the initial proposal of analyzing cyberspace attacks using the criminal law model.\n\nThe criminal law model’s reliance on clear definitions requires us to focus on the causative event, versus emphasizing the effects. For example, a crime is committed when a person fires a gun toward another, regardless of whether the other person is actually struck by a bullet. The minimum crime is some type of assault, likely an aggravated one, in the absence of a legal defense. If the person is struck by the bullet (effect of attack) or other circumstances are developed to indicate a more serious intent, then the chargeable crimes range from aggravated assault to murder. As this example demonstrates, under a criminal law approach, a crime (attack) occurred under all of the factual variations. The increase in harm (effect) only increases the level of punishment the offender may face from society and does not influence whether a crime of some sort occurred.\n\n78 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

This deterrence objective is a philosophical difference between a criminal law approach and an effects-based approach relying on international law. International law, relying upon an effects-based threshold, is implicated only when an incident’s consequences rise above a certain threshold. Whereas the criminal law model reacts even if there is just an attempt to commit a prohibited act. Thus, a criminal law approach focuses on the actual act and the method used, whether accessing a computer without proper authorization or robbing a bank with a gun. Relying on the criminal law approach allows one to examine the genesis of an attack at an even deeper level. The criminal law approach strives to provide clarity and consistency, allowing all members of a society to know what conduct is prohibited, which also serves the additional objective of deterrence. In the case of defining cyberspace attacks, a consideration of cyberspace weapons is the key to providing such clarity.\n\nThe use of a weapon of some kind is the true genesis of an attack. In fact, the types of weapons available to a state determine the possible attack methodologies.³² Thus, studying weapons is also important to understanding the strategy of potential adversaries. However, for the purpose of providing clarity to the issue of armed attacks in cyberspace, the definition of what is a weapon in cyberspace becomes the foundational question to developing a new approach to international law affecting cyberspace operations.\n\nWhile the U.N. General Assembly used the term “any weapon” and provided no further definition of what constitutes a weapon, one can turn to the law of armed conflict (LOAC) for assistance. Based on the LOAC’s specific guidance regarding conventional tools of war, conventional militaries tend to have a practical understanding of what are lawful and unlawful weapons. For example, exploding bullets and poisonous gas are unlawful weapons.³³ The LOAC focuses, however, almost completely on kinetic weapons.\n\nDespite its narrow focus on kinetic weapons, the LOAC has nevertheless struggled to define a “weapon,” and there is currently no\n\n³² For example, possessing and being able to field deep strike kinetic weapons such as low observable bombers opens up a range of options for a state actor.

THE KEY TO THIS PUZZLE: CYBERSPACE WEAPONS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW DEFINITION-BASED MODEL\n\n### A. Defining Cyberspace Weapons\n\nThe criminal law approach and methodology help resolve the issues of ambiguity, enforceability, and attribution for two reasons. First, it provides strong definitions that can withstand judicial scrutiny and allow for fair application to a variety of fact patterns. A nuance of this first strength is that criminal law definitions must also clearly put everyone on notice as to prohibited activities. The second strength is that the criminal law methodology requires the definition of a prohibited act to have some degree of intent, also known as the scienter element. Relying on these strengths, the criminal law approach creates a definition of a cyberspace crime that is clear, flexible, and requires a minimum level of intent. The criminal law methodology will then enable us to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace crime in order to establish the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\n\nAs noted earlier, the European Union’s Convention on Cybercrime is an international treaty intended to create consistency in criminal laws related to internet activities. Unfortunately, the Cybercrime Convention does not offer a definition of malicious logic or cyberspace weapon. Instead, the Cybercrime Convention identifies specific activities states should criminalize. Logically, the reason to prohibit certain activities is to avoid unwanted effects. The criminal law methodology is able to transform unwanted effects into specific definitions and prohibitions, whereas the current approach under international humanitarian law relies on an ambiguous analysis of facts using undefined prohibitions.\n\nThe intent of the Cybercrime Convention was to set up a basic framework whereby the parties agreed to create their own state criminal codes to address broadly defined prohibited activities. Because the Convention defines prohibited activities broadly, it does not provide the detailed definitions of actual effects in cyberspace necessary to specifically define a cyberspace weapon. Nevertheless, the Convention’s aspirational criminal law definitions of unlawful activity in cyberspace can help identify the international community’s thoughts\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 81",

Cyberspace attacks, just like criminal hacks, are designed to affect electromagnetic data in various ways, which then impact the adversary's cyberspace to create an operational advantage for the attacker. Thus, the basic legal framework of the Cybercrime Convention is beneficial in the context of military operations in cyberspace.\n\nAlthough the Cybercrime Convention does not provide definitions of key terms such as \"damaging\" or \"altering,\" the Cybercrime Convention points us to the criminal codes of party states, such as the United States, to specifically define the actus reus. The criminal code of the United States is considered for several reasons: the United States invented the internet; the United States is arguably the largest user of cyberspace; the United States is a leading prosecutor of cyberspace crimes; and many nations work with the United States to solve cyberspace crimes.\n\nSection 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes intentionally causing damage to a protected computer.[42] Section 1030 is often used by U.S. Attorneys to prosecute persons who steal or corrupt data located on computer systems and persons who engage in denial of service attacks. Section 1030 defines \"damage\" as \"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.\" This definition of \"damage\" recognizes the reality of what happens during a criminal hack or a cyberspace attack: \"damage\" in cyberspace does not require smashing, burning, or blowing things up. The U.S. Code provides a clear, judicially accepted and internationally recognized definition of damage in the cyberspace realm. By borrowing from this definition, it is possible to logically develop a definition of a cyberspace weapon, the key to the puzzle.[43]\n\nFrom the above, we see that in its most simple terms, the definition of a weapon is \"something that causes damage.\" Applying the definition of damage from Section 1030, I propose the following definition of a cyberspace weapon: Any capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.[44] Although the proposed definition uses the term\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n83",

The term “disable” requires that a weapon must cause a complete loss of function, while the term “impair” recognizes that malicious software code need only reduce an information system’s capability, i.e. degrade.⁴⁵\n\n## B. Applying the Definition of a Cyberspace Weapon\n\nNow that we have defined cyberspace weapon, the remaining challenge is to determine whether the proposed definition works within the context of cyberspace operations and within the current limits of international law. While the first instances of negative code may not have been written with the intent of harming a computer, today the story is quite different. Today, the development of computer code that negatively impacts an information system has evolved and spread like an advanced, persistent plague. The tools of the modern hacker, whether criminal, military, terrorist, geek, or spy, are broadly referred to as malicious logic. While malicious logic can take many forms, the key question for our purposes is: “At what point does malicious logic become a cyberspace weapon, the use of which constitutes an armed attack under international law?” The first part of the question focuses not on the end result but on the “tool” used in cyberspace and whether that tool is a “weapon.” The second part of the question will focus on the weapon’s use in cyberspace.\n\nFirst, one must consider whether particular cyberspace “tools” constitute weapons under international law. The ICRC Commentary on Article 35 of Additional Protocol I states: “The words ‘methods and means’ include weapons in the widest sense, as well as the way in which they are used.”⁴⁶ Furthermore, the ICRC Guide on New Weapons expounds on the above commentary provision by noting that the legal\n\n⁴⁵ Again, recall that while the services’ definitions of weapon all used the term “disable,” JP 1-02, supra note 41, uses the term “degrade” when describing Computer Network Attack.\n\n⁴⁶ Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1402 (for art. 35). Article 35 provides overarching guidance regarding the means and methods of warfare and reads:\n\nBasic rules - 1. In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. 2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. 3. It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.\n\nProtocol I, supra note 19, at art. 35.\n\n84 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

Considering the realities of these two events, does the proposed definition provide sufficient clarity for use in international law?\n\nThe cyberspace event in April and May of 2007 in Estonia involved a number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) actions against the networks for the two largest banks, effectively severing all internet communications for two hours and causing partial interruptions thereafter.49 The event also included acts against an Estonian government internet service provider that “disrupted government communications for at least a short period of time.”50 Lastly, the web page for the Estonian Prime Minister was “defaced,” manipulating it to show an alleged apology for moving a Soviet World War II memorial.51 Clearly, the event in Estonia resulted in reduced availability and impaired the integrity of the information located on computer systems in Estonia. Applying the attacker’s methods to the proposed definition, it is clear these methods constituted “cyberspace weapons.”\n\nThe cyberspace event that occurred in July and August of 2008 in Georgia results in a similar conclusion. Again, a DDoS event targeted the website of the Georgian President, making it unavailable for 24 hours. Attackers also defaced the website with pictures of Adolf Hitler next to the image of the Georgian President, and, using malicious logic, caused websites for other government agencies to lose connectivity.52 Here again, the methods used by cyberspace attackers in Georgia caused a loss of access and impaired the integrity of the data. Consequently, it is appropriate to label these methods as “cyberspace weapons.” The proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon therefore\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 85\n\n47 ICRC GUIDE ON NEW WEAPONS, supra note 36, at 9–10.\n48 Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1469 (for art. 35).\n49 Kenneth Geers, Cyberspace and the Changing Nature of Warfare, Keynote Speech for NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CDCOE) 9 (Oct. 13, 2008), available at http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/Cyberspace%20and%20the%20Changing%20Nature%20of%20Warfare.pdf (NATO CDCOE can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.ccdcoe.org).\n50 Id.\n51 Id.\n52 NATO COOPERATIVE CYBER DEFENCE CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE, supra note 2, at 28-33.",

When is the Use of a Cyberspace Weapon a Cyberspace Attack?\n\nAcknowledging that cyberspace weapons were used in the events in Estonia and Georgia does not answer the ultimate question of whether the acts should be considered armed attacks under international law? Here again, the temptation is to return to an effects-based analysis to answer the question. However, as noted at the beginning of this article, previous attempts to answer the question using such an analysis provide ambiguous answers at best. Instead, by applying a definition-based approach, much like the criminal law does, there is a higher likelihood of reaching a clear answer. Therefore, in order to determine when the use of a cyberspace weapon constitutes an “armed attack” under international law, one must look to how the cyberspace weapon is used rather than its effects.\n\nThis question of how a weapon is used is the key transitional point in this analytical approach and borrows substantially from the criminal law. For example, a gun can either be a weapon used to kill people or a weapon used to assist a hunter in gathering food. The intent of the user remains the primary issue under the criminal law. Using this criminal law approach will enable conversion of the above question into a definition applicable to the international law arena.\n\nTo prove an offense under the criminal law, almost all crimes require proof of *mens rea*, the idea of a criminal intent or purpose. Specifically, most crimes require proof of either specific or general intent or knowledge. The most difficult *mens rea* to prove is specific intent, whereas knowledge is much more easily inferred from the circumstances. Considering history and the unwillingness of state actors to admit their actual intent, proving the specific or general intent of a state actor is very difficult when relying on circumstantial evidence, and would therefore result in an unenforceable definition beneficial only to academic discussions.\n\nTherefore, because proof of knowledge is easier to prove than either a specific or general *mens rea*, it will lead to a more enforceable standard and place a higher level of responsibility on states. Even though knowledge is a lower threshold than specific or general intent, it is nevertheless a common and accepted *mens rea* requirement under criminal law. Still, the question remains, knowledge of what? As will be discussed further below, state actors have a responsibility, as sovereigns with power and control, to conduct their affairs with due regard for their international legal obligations when they have knowledge of activities within their legal or physical boundaries. Hence, it is appropriate to consider the following definition of a\n\n86 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

Under the unique circumstances of cyberspace, such a clear definition establishes the increased degree of responsibility necessary to promote international peace and help deter the myriad of adverse activities in cyberspace. Consider the actions of one rogue group if they were to successfully conduct a cyberspace attack against the critical infrastructure of another state. Regardless of the group's motives, whether nationalistic, ideological, or criminal, causing the death of several hundred people and millions of dollars worth of property damage is a scenario that international law must evolve to address and deter. Still, if the state is completely unaware of a rogue element's activities, then it seems appropriate not to impart responsibility and accountability under international law.\n\nHowever, what if the state that can legally control the rogue element knew that the element was about to or was currently engaging in a cyberspace attack against persons or property in the victim state? The responsible state could, if necessary, disrupt all communications originating from the rogue element or emanating from the state until it could locate and arrest the attackers for violating their domestic laws. The definition of a cyberspace attack, although similar to the definition of a cyberspace crime, is not intended to hold states responsible for the nefarious efforts of criminals, unless the state is aware of the criminal's efforts and knowingly acquiesces to the use of a cyberspace weapon. The objective is to develop a legal framework that inspires states to cooperate to eliminate the harmful use of cyberspace—to create deterrence.\n\nWithout the proposed legal framework, why should a state try to stop an impending cyberspace attack against another state? Under current state practice, if the victim state is an \"ally,\" then the responsible, \"host\" state will likely feel much more compelled to take positive steps to stop the attack. For example, if a hacker in the United Kingdom was conducting a cyberspace attack against the Hoover Dam in the United States, U.K. security and law enforcement officials would almost certainly act with all diligence to stop the attack and arrest the perpetrators, and would likely allow their extradition to the United States.[53] However, how many cyberspace events against entities in the\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n87",

Resolution 1373 decided under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that all states shall take the necessary steps to prevent terrorist acts, to prevent terrorists from using their territories for terrorist purposes, and to provide early warning to other states.⁵⁶\n\nAlthough not directly on point with all scenarios of cyberspace attack, some cyberspace attacks could fit within the resolutions’ already accepted prohibitions related to harboring terrorists, preventing use of territory by terrorists, and acquiescing to those who cause civil strife. The proposed definition of armed attack in cyberspace would really only increase the degree of state responsibility for non-state actors by a small amount. In light of the growing concern related to the impact of non-state actors on international peace, and considering the asymmetric and potentially dangerous attributes of cyberspace, such an increase in state responsibility is not unreasonable.\n\nThe strength of the proposed definition of cyberspace attack is that it would place a clear responsibility on all states. All states would know what international law requires and non-state actors would know that their actions could be considered armed attacks. Although clear and strict in comparison to the current approach, the proposed legal threshold is not improperly low. It has a reasonable *mens rea* requirement, to wit: the host state must have knowledge of the impending or ongoing use of a cyberspace weapon. Because the proposed definition requires knowing acquiescence, a state can claim the defense of impossibility. For example, the host state may have no knowledge of an ongoing cyberspace attack because the rogue element first hacked into and gained control of the entire host state’s communications infrastructure. Still, once the host state became aware of the intended location of the attack, it would then be responsible to at least communicate that information to the victim state and continue to take reasonable measures to stop or impede the attack and cooperate with the victim state.\n\nThe unique attributes of cyberspace, such as its speed and lack of physical borders, are key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory when they do not take reasonable measures to stop the attack and warn the victim state.

Therefore, another difference between the proposed definition and current requirements under international law is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack does not include a requirement that the attack involve the armed forces of the aggressor, as the commentary to Common Article 2 requires and the U.N. definition of aggression implies. However, the U.N. definition of aggression clearly includes mercenaries and irregulars. Once more, considering the asymmetric nature of cyberspace, requiring a cyberspace attack to involve the armed forces or mercenaries of the aggressor would create a legal hole big enough for hundreds of thugs and brigands to \"attack\" the victim state. In consideration of the incredible amount of physical or information damage that non-state actors can cause in cyberspace, knowing acquiescence to such attacks is the correct standard for imposing state responsibility under international law.\n\nBut, is it fair to impose such strict accountability on the use of cyberspace, when some cyberspace attributes, such as ease of access and use, are similar to those of global commons? For example, some may argue that the proposed definition is contrary to Article 8 of the Hague Regulation (V).[57] Article 8 provides that “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” It is accepted that many cyberspace communications occur over “telephone cables” and similar telecommunications infrastructure. Thus, the language of Article 8 is applicable to cyberspace operations. Article 8 clearly does not place a duty on a neutral power to forbid or restrict belligerents from using their communications infrastructure. In fact, Article 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) states that any restrictive measures implemented by a neutral power must be equally applied to “both belligerents.” Article 8’s language, therefore, appears to contradict the proposed definition.\n\nAlternatively, one could argue that the proposed definition of cyberspace attack does not conflict with Article 8, because the proposed definition creates a transitional status for a state. Once a state becomes aware of a cyberspace attack originating from its territory and targeting another state, it is no longer a \"neutral power\" and now must act to stop the attack or become a de facto \"belligerent.\" The idea of a state transitioning between being a neutral power and a belligerent may be too tenuous for realistic application in international law.

Despite early and widespread media attribution to Russia, the attacks continued, strongly implying that Russia was directly responsible for the attacks.⁵⁸ Apparently, Russian law enforcement and security services made no effort to stop the cyberspace attacks.⁵⁹ Russia was certainly on notice that the world community believed the cyberspace attacks were originating from within its borders. While circumstantial evidence clearly indicated that Russia knowingly acquiesced to these attacks, there was no direct evidence. Reviewing the circumstantial evidence under the proposed definition indicates that Russia violated international law and the victim states had the right of self-defense. However, relying on circumstantial evidence is not something the international community and international law are generally comfortable doing.\n\nThis lack of direct evidence is indicative of the attribution problem currently hindering all investigations of actions in cyberspace. Investigators of domestic cyberspace crimes meticulously use forensic tools to identify which specific internet protocol (IP) address is responsible for a cyberspace crime and then interview the suspect to determine their level of knowledge or intent. Unfortunately, overseas investigations can only be accomplished if there is cooperation between the involved states. When a foreign state does not provide equal access to forensic evidence and suspects, the attribution barrier obstructs the inquiry and protects the “attacker.” Such actions do not promote peace or resolve conflict.\n\nThe effects-based model would likely conclude that the Estonia and Georgia attacks were not severe enough to be considered armed attacks or even an unlawful use of force.

If Estonia felt it had sufficient attribution, Estonia could have considered the acts armed attacks, creating a de facto state of hostilities and requested the assistance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under the NATO Treaty’s collective self-defense provision.⁶⁰ Estonia could have waited for NATO to risk war with Russia.

Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.\n\n92 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

The end result would hopefully be a dramatic decrease in cyberspace events of foreign origin, which would also reduce the likelihood of a cyberspace “arms race” and cause the de-escalation of low intensity conflicts in cyberspace.\n\n## D. Flies in the Ointment: Attribution and Espionage\n\nAs referenced above, an effects-based approach magnifies the attribution problem, because it requires attribution of intentional direct participation or support by the state actor, versus knowing acquiescence. The difficulty of attribution in cyberspace prevents the evolution of realistic customary norms.⁶² No state actor can realistically consider the full spectrum of actions, because they do not know who acted against them or why. In addition, the difficulty in comprehending the full severity of the “attack,” because of the delayed effects of cyberspace weapons, compounds the difficulty in determining an appropriate response.\n\nUnlike the effects-based approach, the proposed definition does not require determining who controlled or supported the activity, the aggressor’s intent, or the full magnitude of the attack. Using the\n\n⁶¹ The concept of boundaries and sovereignty in cyberspace is also a topic of discussion amongst academics and practitioners. Although there is no clear definition and enforcement of boundaries in cyberspace, all states should recognize that electronic communications of all types originate in one state and can terminate (and have effects) in another state. Therefore, a state can monitor communications occurring inside its geographic borders. For example, the NSA under the Terrorist Surveillance Program was able to monitor communications where one party was located “outside” the United States. White House Press Briefing, Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales &amp; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, Principal Deputy Dir. of Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2005/intell-051219-dni01.htm. The concept of cyberspace borders has even been expanded to include discussions of a cyberspace Monroe Doctrine with regard to cyberspace infrastructure associated to the United States.

In order for scientific experiments and their results to be reliable, external factors must be eliminated or controlled, and all other factors must be accurately known. The lack of attribution makes it impossible to accurately complete a heuristic analysis, since three of the most important factors, identity, intent, and full severity of attack, will rarely be known without it.\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 93",

Second, did a foreign state knowingly allow an entity under its legal control to use the cyberspace weapon against the victim?\n\nEven with the proposed definitions and a two element test, one of the oldest arts, espionage, can still take advantage of the attribution difficulties in cyberspace. Espionage has long been recognized as essential to the success of states and their militaries.⁶³ While a criminal offense in virtually every nation state, espionage is not a violation of the law of war and was first recognized in the Lieber Code in 1863.⁶⁴ It was subsequently codified in the 1907 Hague Regulations and in Protocol I.⁶⁵ Acts deemed to be espionage will not trigger a state’s right to self-defense, because espionage does not violate international law. Based on the definitions from the various documents considered part of customary international law, the consistent requirement for espionage is that a member of the armed forces gathers or attempts to gather information under false pretenses or while not wearing their uniform.\n\nSuch a definition does not perfectly transfer over to espionage in cyberspace. Whether the person at the other computer terminal is wearing his uniform is irrelevant to attributing his identity and intent in cyberspace. Still, a cyberspace spy will intrinsically gain access to the information or data under false pretenses. The average cyberspace intruder does not disclose his identity nor does he come to the main web page and ask the webmaster for permission. Instead, he exploits vulnerabilities in software coding that allow him to gain unauthorized access, which is essentially under false pretenses as discussed in Article\n\n⁶³ Sun Tzu stated: “So, as for enlightened lords or distinguished commanders, the reason they can overcome the adversary when action is taken and achieve unparalleled success is prescience. Prescience cannot be gained from ghost or gods . . . . It must be gained from what is learned by men.” SUN TZU, SUN TZU: THE NEW TRANSLATION 112 (J. H.

Article 88 defines a spy as: “a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy.”\n\n⁶⁵ Article 29 of Hague Regulation (IV), supra note 33, defines a spy thus:\n\n[A]cting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information, are not considered spies.\n\nArticle 46 of Protocol I, supra note 19, provides that a member of the armed forces shall not be considered a spy “unless he does so through an act of false pretences or deliberately in a clandestine manner.”\n\n94 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

Even when an intruder sends an e-mail directly to an authorized user, asking the user to provide his password information, the e-mail is still sent under false pretenses.⁶⁶\n\nIt is certainly possible for cyberspace spies to gain access to information and copy or degrade the data without the use of a cyberspace weapon. However, the tension between lawful espionage and armed attack in cyberspace occurs when a spy uses a cyberspace weapon to access or steal information. If a traditional spy uses a weapon, such as a pistol, the act is viewed as a criminal act, versus an armed attack. Should the same be true of a cyberspace spy who hacks into a system by using a cyberspace weapon? Applying the proposed definition of cyberspace attack, the use of a cyberspace weapon while committing espionage in or through cyberspace could be interpreted as a cyberspace attack and result in self-defense actions.\n\nThe only way to resolve the tension between cyberspace espionage and cyberspace attack is to determine whether the cyberspace intruder intends solely to copy and then steal the data or information. Again, this dilemma adds a layer of complexity to the attribution issue by now requiring a determination of the actor’s full intent, creating an untenable situation for the victim state. Given that actions happen so fast in cyberspace, a spy or attacker could move “in and out” before a victim state could do any more than determine the foreign internet protocol (IP) address of the intruder. A full damage assessment, identifying what happened to the victim computer system could take hours to weeks. While some cyberspace attacks may be obvious, many will not be, as the beauty of cyberspace warfare is the ability to create second and third order effects, which are difficult to identify in advance.\n\nThe attribution issue reaches a pinnacle of complexity when trying to resolve events between espionage and cyberspace attacks. Therefore, today, a victim state is left with three choices: (1) continue to operate in the current international system of subjective analysis and inconsistent past responses while ineffectively trying to gather very detailed attribution information; (2) develop a robust cyberspace force capable of conducting cyberspace attacks, cyberspace espionage, and able to “hack back” to develop reasonably detailed attribution information; (3) or issue an ultimatum to the international community, hoping that others will agree, which informs all other states that any activity in that state’s territory that is determined to satisfy the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack will justify self-defense actions by the victim state.\n\n⁶⁶ Phishing or spear phishing emails target known users on a network and always provide a false reason for the recipient to provide key information or click on a hyperlink that will then redirect the user to another web page where malicious code, read weapon, will be surreptitiously installed on the user’s computer.\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 95",

In addition, the evidence to satisfy the international community would likely include the elusive proof of actual intent to harm the victim state. Adversarial states could choose to take advantage of this slow analysis and decision loop, achieving paralysis by analysis, and methodically weaken a state with what appears to be cyberspace espionage but is in fact a number of cyberspace attacks aimed at creating third order effects. Lastly, it appears that states are not willingly sharing the details of their cyberspace activities with others, which still leaves a void of necessary information to conduct the required heuristic analysis to develop the law under the current framework.\n\nThe second option will help the state protect itself from adversarial activities in cyberspace and possibly lead to attributable information. In spite of this benefit, the potential of a cyberspace arms race increases. This development could lead to an increase in low scale cyberspace conflicts and ultimately result in an adversary conducting a second or third order cyberspace attack inflicting massive casualties or property damage.67 The continued development of cyberspace capabilities appears to be the current direction of the leading states, such as China, Russia, and the United States. States certainly cannot be faulted for taking such an approach, as the current international legal scheme offers them very little protection yet many opportunities to exploit the cyberspace of other states. Therefore, the race for dominance in cyberspace has begun and may soon grow out of control.\n\nThe second option also has some parallels to the approach that states took when nuclear tensions were high during the Cold War. The superpowers recognized that conventional methodologies could not be applied to the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). States recognized that Article 51’s right of self-defense limited them to proportional actions. However, due to the overwhelming effect and fairly rapid speed of any nuclear attack, states were doctrinally prepared to respond in full at the first indication of even a limited attack, since they recognized that they could not afford to wait and see how many warheads or which locations the adversary’s warheads hit and how much damage they caused. Superpowers projected that they were capable, prepared, and willing to respond to even a limited, targeted nuclear first-strike with a full-scale response.\n\n67 Cyberspace attacks against critical infrastructure, aircraft and air traffic control software, navigation systems (GPS), and pharmaceutical companies to alter the code for medicines and vaccines are just some examples of cyberspace attacks that may not have recognizable first order effects, but catastrophic subsequent effects.\n\n96 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

While many decried the age of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and called it “mad,” one cannot dispute that during that time period, even though there was a nuclear arms race, no nuclear weapons were used. Mad or not, MAD was an effective method of deterrence. There are a number of parallels between the use of ICBMs and cyberspace operations: cyberspace attacks have the potential for incredible lethality; much greater speed than previous weapons; and the actual severity of the threat, the intent, and the identity of the actor are usually too difficult to determine in sufficient time to respond appropriately before the damage is done.\n\nHowever, there is one crucial difference between today’s option two situation (developing a robust cyberspace force and “hacking back”) and the deterrence model of MAD during the Cold War. Currently, it does not appear that a substantial number of states are willing to make a declaration of mutually assured destruction through cyberspace and simultaneously abstain from conducting cyberspace operations. Without such declarations and cessation of the use of cyberspace weapons, the parallels with the Cold War nuclear deterrence model end. Pragmatically, states do not feel the impetus to consider such an approach. There has been no mass disaster or 9-11 type “wake-up call” in cyberspace, and, as noted above, a number of states likely believe they can “win” in cyberspace. Therefore, applying the nuclear deterrence model to cyberspace operations is not practical. Unfortunately, history has shown that society rarely chooses to collectively legislate against harm until after it suffers the consequences.\n\nStill, there is one historical example where society chose to proactively legislate and limit the weaponization of a domain, much like option three. The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space.⁶⁸ The third option can perhaps draw strength from the efforts to limit the militarization of space, recognizing cyberspace as a sort of international commons similar to outer space. Each state, relying on the proposed definitions, would still retain its sovereignty and control of cyberspace infrastructure located within its borders. The implementation of the proposed definitions would recognize that the use of cyberspace is intended for peace-promoting purposes and the use of weapons in cyberspace, even for espionage purposes, will not be accepted.

APPLYING THE DEFINITIONS AND EXERCISING SELF-DEFENSE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nIn order to further understand how option three’s (issuing an ultimatum that the state could respond in self-defense to cyberspace attacks) use of the proposed definitions will promote peace and reduce the improper use of cyberspace, it is helpful to explore how states could act in response to a cyberspace attack. The doctrine of self-defense relies on two principles: necessity and proportionality. Necessity involves whether effective peaceful means of resolution exist; the nature of the aggression, each party’s objectives, and the likelihood of effective intervention by the international community.⁶⁹ Proportionality requires limiting the magnitude, scope, and duration of the force used in response to that which is reasonably necessary to counter the threat or attack.⁷⁰ The timing of a self-defense action is closely related to the factor of necessity and is a debated issue. A delayed response weakens a state’s claim of necessity to defend itself. While an early response in anticipation of attack also draws questions as to the certainty of need for the self-defense action.\n\nLooking at necessity and the timing of self-defense actions in cyberspace, the unique qualities of cyberspace again highlight the importance of moving toward a deterrence model. Once a state suffers what it believes to be an armed attack in or through cyberspace, it can arguably satisfy the above requirements of necessity to defend itself. Unfortunately, in cyberspace, there will likely not be sufficient time to consider peaceful resolution of the matter, fully understand the nature of the attack or the intended results, or to mobilize international peacekeeping forces. Thus, the more difficult question related to necessity is how appropriate is anticipatory self-defense in cyberspace?\n\nAnticipatory self-defense “justifies use of force in anticipation of an ‘imminent’ armed attack.”⁷¹ Basically, a state need not wait to receive the aggressor’s attack and can instead act in self-defense to “repel” the attack.⁷² The doctrine “finds it roots in the 1837 Caroline case and subsequent correspondence between then-U.S. Secretary of\n\n⁶⁹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK 4 (2007) [hereinafter U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK]; see also YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION AND SELF-DEFENCE (4th ed. 2005).\n\n⁷⁰ U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 69.\n\n⁷¹ Id. at 6.\n\n⁷² Id.\n\n98 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

Essentially, if a state is fortunate enough to develop information about a developing or planned cyberspace attack against it, the attributes of cyberspace may compel a state to act in its best interest and exercise anticipatory self-defense.\n\nThe follow-on question involves what a state can do in self-defense, i.e. how is the principle of proportional response applied in and through cyberspace? In cyberspace, there may be a number of ways to technically counter an attack. A state could disconnect itself from cyberspace. However, such a response seems disproportionately burdensome on the victim state and could cause other forms of harm internally. The victim state could quickly counter with anti-virus measures, although such efforts are always a game of \"catch-up.\" The victim state could respond by disconnecting all cyberspace connections with the aggressor state. However, this will only work as long as the aggressor state chooses not to attack through another state. Moreover, such actions require attribution.\n\nBecause a state needs to know against which state to exercise self-defense, developing reliable attribution represents another difficulty with applying age-old laws and methods to cyberspace. Given that a cyberspace attack comes from another country and could involve communications \"hopping\" through several other countries, it is nearly impossible for a state to develop attribution without first violating the cyberspace infrastructure and jurisdiction of other states. Currently, to avoid violating another state's cyberspace, states send requests for assistance to cooperating states. The victim state requests help in developing information about the IP address in question and also requests monitoring of that IP address, allowing the state to \"hop back\" to the next IP address, and then request more help. This \"hopping back\" process can be painful and long, leaving the victim state vulnerable. However, the traditional police doctrine of hot pursuit is expanding in international law. Under customary international law, ships and planes can follow offending vessels in hot pursuit up to another state's territorial sea or airspace.75 However, the European Union has adopted the Schengen Agreement that permits law enforcement officials to cross state borders when pursuing a criminal suspected of certain serious\n\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 99\n\n73 Id.\n74 Id.\n75 Id. at 541.",

Permitting hot pursuit is consistent with the proposed definition’s efforts to deter states from knowingly acquiescing to cyberspace attacks. Witting host states will find it much harder to hide in the shadow of attribution. Providing victim states with a legal “hot pursuit” capability, including proper coordination mechanisms, will be invaluable to promoting cooperation, reducing crime, and deterring attacks in and through cyberspace.\n\nWith the ability to more quickly attribute attacks, a state would then have other options to consider under the principle of proportionate response. The victim state could consider firing back in self-defense with a cyberspace weapon at the actual computer(s) used to attack it. This can be reasonably effective if a limited number of computers are involved.⁷⁸ However, a victim state will likely remain concerned, due to its limited ability to determine whether more attacks or attacks of increasing severity will follow the initial round of attacks. This challenge may lead a state to consider more serious measures, such as responding with a self-defense attack that involves disrupting a substantial portion of the witting host state’s cyberspace. However, the collateral damage from such a self-defense action could be substantial. The questions of necessity and anticipatory self-defense also affect the proportionality decision. Moreover, nothing prohibits states from defending against a cyberspace attack by using kinetic weapons, such as striking a key communication node with a cruise missile or damaging a state’s communication satellite(s). The hypotheticals and the potential for conflict abound. Thus, the unique nature of cyberspace and the inability to clearly apply current international laws, norms, and practices make resolution of conflict extremely difficult, and should inspire states to seek a framework of cooperation and deterrence, such as the one I advocate in this article.\n\n100 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

LOOKING FORWARD AND CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\n\nThe definitions proposed in this article provide a framework for consistency and an opportunity to level the playing field of international law. Today, states can either choose to continue with the status quo, or, recognizing the benefits of the peaceful use of cyberspace, embrace the need for clear definitions of cyberspace weapon and cyberspace attack. Embracing the definitions I propose would, at most, have a moderate impact on how international affairs are conducted today. The Schengen Agreement and the E.U. Convention on Cybercrime serve as models to build a framework of cooperation to promote peace and reduce crime. States would need to establish cyberspace communications centers, whereby each state would agree to pass information to another state as soon as it became aware of a cyberspace attack against a victim state, but is currently unable to halt the attack from affecting the victim state.⁷⁹ The centers would also coordinate the hot pursuit issues related to developing attribution.\n\nThose states that choose not to adopt the proposed legal definitions and methods of cooperation would do so knowing that their actions or inaction could be viewed as a cyberspace attack. Each state would still continue to exercise its right of self-defense. Meanwhile, the international community could apply the new legal standard when considering whether to apply sanctions. The end result is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack with cooperative application under international law could make a powerful form of asymmetric warfare untenable before it develops into an arms race that leads to increased conflicts and harms people and property.\n\nWhen our predecessors developed the law of conflict management it is doubtful anyone could foresee the day when a state could attack another state simply by manipulating electronic data. Even the futuristic Buck Rogers and lasers still had visible, kinetic-like effects. Today, one must recognize that the lack of specific definitions for “weapon” and “armed attack” create an untenable vacuum in the evolving domain of cyberspace. So far, only the criminal law has provided thorough definitions in an attempt to keep pace with the development of nefarious tools in cyberspace. The criminal law methodology provides a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt such definitions to the various uses of prohibited cyberspace tools. The field of international law requires similar flexibility. This article attempted to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon from the criminal law’s efforts to specifically define the acts caused by cyberspace criminals.

INTRODUCTION\nChange has come and gone. While academics have been discussing methods to define the use of force in cyberspace, governments and policy makers may have missed an opportunity to shape the law of war. Just like a child “pinching” a peppermint from the candy store while the owner was not looking, someone may have successfully launched two cyberspace attacks, and no one called either one an unlawful use of force or armed attack. Did a state actor set a precedent that could become part of customary international law?\nEvery day there are new stories and developments about the increasing connectivity of people around the world spurred by the continued fast pace of technological developments in the computer and communications industries. Military applications of cyberspace are also rapidly evolving, moving the domain of cyberspace to the front lines of conflicts. But, the legal frameworks that regulate war or armed conflict are lagging far behind the technological changes that have already occurred. Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light. Unfortunately, law, especially international law, failed to keep pace with the new applications of existing technologies.³ On the criminal front, law enforcement agencies are swamped with allegations ranging from identity theft to theft of corporate data, while armed with only a marginally effective process to investigate, extradite, and prosecute international cyberspace criminals. However, the conduct of military operations in and through cyberspace, with potentially greater global implications, is bypassing the currently inadequate mire of international law. What if international law could provide a framework capable of enabling deterrence in cyberspace?\n¹ U.S.-CHINA ECON. &amp; SEC.

The unique qualities of operations in cyberspace will make this the most difficult domain in which to resolve international disputes and conflict. In this article, I intend to offer a new methodology for determining armed attacks in cyberspace by using existing criminal law legal tools. Specifically, this methodology will borrow from the criminal law’s definitions of cyberspace crimes, in order to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon. More importantly, by defining cyberspace weapon, this methodology will enable the international community to define what constitutes a cyberspace attack. Providing the legal framework for a definition of cyberspace attack, such as the new methodology outlined in this article, will serve to reduce the potential for conflict in cyberspace.\nThe article will first examine cyberspace and how current approaches have attempted to apply international law to armed attacks in cyberspace. Looking through the lens of current international laws will highlight how the unique attributes of cyberspace could increase the likelihood of international conflict. The article will identify how the failure of international law to define armed attacks and weapons further exacerbates this problem. The article will then transition from current international laws to examine whether current criminal law definitions and methodologies can fill the gap and provide realistic definitions of weapons and armed attacks in cyberspace. Lastly, the article will put these proposed definitions to the test against the most challenging aspects of cyberspace: attribution and espionage.\n⁴ See, e.g., Michael N.

APPLYING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBERSPACE ATTACKS: FALLING SHORT WITHOUT DEFINITIONS\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nFor the purposes of this article, I define cyberspace as *an evolving man-made domain for the organization and transfer of data using various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The domain is a combination of private and public property governed by technical rule sets designed primarily to facilitate the flow of information.*⁵ The key feature of cyberspace is that it is a man-made domain designed to transfer data and information.\nInformation is the reason cyberspace exists, and this feature makes current discussions involving the international law of conflict management, *jus ad bellum*, so different from traditional *jus ad bellum* discussions. Simply put, information is fundamentally different than the traditional tools of war; bits and bytes bear no physical resemblance to bullets and bombs. Michael Schmitt noted that cyberspace threats differ in four ways from traditional threats: (1) computer networks are a new target category, with computer network attacks capable of providing the same results as striking the traditional target with a kinetic weapon; (2) an attack does not have to use kinetic force and can solely involve a command from one computer to the target system; (3) the intended results are often not kinetic and could simply involve the manipulation of data or disruption of a service; and (4) cyberspace threats are not constrained by political boundaries or geography.⁶\nI would add four more distinguishing factors between cyberspace threats and traditional or kinetic uses of force: (1) cyberspace attacks can be completed literally at the speed of light; (2) the results of some cyberspace attacks, whether intended or not, can be similar to those involving weapons of mass destruction;⁷ (3) the cost of acquiring the equipment and expertise to conduct operations in\n---\n⁵ This definition was developed jointly with my cyberspace law cohort, Major Noah Bledstein at 8 AF/JA. Major Bledstein has been working on cyberspace law issues since 2003. His assistance in discussing and developing the ideas and definitions in this paper was invaluable. It does not specifically address the issue of whether some part or all of cyberspace should be considered a global commons.\n⁶ Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, supra note 4, at 888.\n⁷ Because the infrastructure of modern societies relies on the technology and data which can be easily targeted during a cyberspace operation, the disabling of such infrastructure or manipulation of data could cause substantial damage and harm to a society. For example: disabling air traffic control systems or the systems which control the water flowing from a large dam, manipulating the data relied upon by banks or the International Monetary Fund, or manipulating the DNA coding for the subsequent year’s flu vaccine.\ncyberspace is *de minimis* in comparison to fielding conventional forces; and (4) attributing the attack to the responsible party and determining whether the attack was intentional or accidental is extremely difficult.⁸\nThe attribution problem, which this article discusses throughout, is indeed the elusive factor that most severely complicates the application of international law. In fact, the attribution problem makes cyberspace so different from other mediums or domains that it requires an entirely new international law approach. The unique nature of the cyber domain impacts not only national level decisions but also the development of law in this area, as evidenced by the current state of law regarding cyberspace and conflict management, which is discussed below.\n## B. Current Legal Approaches to Cyberspace Attacks\nThe majority of scholars considering attacks in cyberspace have used an ambiguous, effects-based analytical approach relying on international law to determine what constitutes a “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter or whether an “armed attack” occurred under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.⁹ The discussions and articles have also looked to other treaties that comprise international law and the law of war, such as the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions. On first impression, an effects-based approach to the issue that relies on\n⁸ A nuance of limited attribution is that much of the public is unaware of what is going on in cyberspace. In the other domains where military operations are conducted, the activities are much more visible. However, in cyberspace, we can’t easily spot electrons and data packets whisking by us or through a phone line.\n⁹ *See supra* note 4. A brief description of two of the leading approaches follows: First, Gary Sharp’s approach recognizes that a use of force in cyberspace may rise to the threshold of an armed attack, depending on its “scope, duration, and intensity,” which are factors previously relied upon by the United States (*See infra* note 28). Mr. Sharp suggests relying upon an analysis of how states have responded in previous cases to help analyze whether an unlawful use of force or armed attack have occurred, essentially relying on a normative analysis. Mr. Sharp summarizes his test by stating: “What constitutes a use of force of a scope, duration, and intensity that constitutes an armed attack and triggers the law of armed conflict is a question of fact that must be subjectively analyzed in each and every case in the context of all relevant law and circumstances.” SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 69. Michael Schmitt’s analytical approach involves six factors which are used to “délimit” economic/political coercion from determining what is a use of armed force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Mr. Schmitt’s premise for using an effects based approach primarily rests with his assessment that the U.N. Charter was not directly focused on outlawing “force” but rather the “deleterious consequences” of state actions, and outlawing uses of force under Article 2 was a “prescriptive short-hand to achieve their goals.” Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, *supra* note 4, at 911. I would recommend that all practitioners in this area read both works. Mr. Sharp’s book is especially invaluable as a thorough review of international law that applies to cyberspace operations.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 69\ninternational law seems to make sense, since it is electromagnetic data that moves through cyberspace and then creates an electromagnetic effect at the terminating point. The actors certainly focus on what effects they can achieve in and through cyberspace. These effects-based approaches add considerable value to the discussion of the issue, but they are unnecessarily constrained by relying primarily on legal documents and customary international norms developed before the advent of mass-produced computers.\nThe only substantial international legal document developed to address issues related to cyberspace is the European Union's Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰ (Cybercrime Convention). While the Cybercrime Convention does not address cyberspace attacks as possible acts of war and instead focuses on criminal acts, it does help establish a framework for a new methodology of analyzing cyberspace attacks. Instead of focusing on the end result of a cyberspace event, the effects, and trying to determine whether such an act is a use of force or armed attack under international law, a criminal law methodology places increased emphasis on the genesis of a cyberspace event. The criminal law approach thus focuses on defining the beginning of a cyberspace event and not the effects, and those definitions can then be applied to international law and military operations in cyberspace.\nBefore discussing the benefits of the criminal law approach, however, one must first understand how most commentators are currently applying international law to actions in cyberspace. A review of current scholarship on this issue will show the difficulty in applying decades old terms and norms to actions in cyberspace. As a starting point, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”¹¹\nHowever, without international sanctions there is little incentive for a party to comply with Article 2(4)’s peaceful objectives.¹² The\n¹⁰ Convention on Cybercrime, Nov. 23, 2001, 2296 U.N.T.S. 167, available at http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm.\n¹¹ U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4\n¹² Id. Art. 1 of the Charter states the purpose of the Charter. Subparagraph 1 specifically states:\nTo maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.\n70 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nhistorical reality is that most state actors have not conducted themselves as though they feared some form of international punishment for their actions. By itself, Article 2(4) seems, therefore, to create very little deterrent effect in conflict management.\nHowever, in contrast to Article 2(4), Article 51 permits parties to act in self-defense in response to an “armed attack.”¹³ Pragmatically, this right of self-defense can have the quickest success at reducing illegal uses of force constituting breaches of the peace, thereby increasing the deterrent effect of international law.¹⁴ While it is important to analyze whether a state action is a threat or use of force, the more critical question is whether the action is an armed attack, authorizing the recipient to respond in self-defense? The right of self-defense puts other states on notice that their offensive actions could be met with military force.\nThe right of self-defense has historically been limited by the reality that smaller nation states would respond against bigger and more powerful states with conventional force only if an attack truly jeopardized its national survival.¹⁵ This could be called the “bully dilemma” of international law.¹⁶ The “bully dilemma” pragmatically disenfranchises smaller and weaker states from the protection of Article 51. If a “bully” state engages in a small-scale breach of the peace against a significantly smaller state that smaller state will likely\n¹³ Mr. Sharp reasons “a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), however, the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.” Mr. Sharp recognizes that his position may not be held by all and that any right of self-defense is limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity. SHARP, supra note 4, at 48-49.\n¹⁴ When there is a threat or use of force under Article 2, the United Nations can impose sanctions, to include armed intervention under Chapter 7. However, building the consensus for such actions often takes considerable time and debate, while the victims of such use of force wait for relief. Even the liberation of Kuwait took more than six months before U.N. authorized forces began significant operations to remove Iraqi forces.\n¹⁵ For example, when the United States launched cruise missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan in August 1998, neither country responded with conventional force. The codename for the operation was “Infinite Reach.” What if Sudan had then possessed a capability to respond in cyberspace? How could Sudan respond in cyberspace, and would the U.S. have countered, if attribution could be obtained?\n¹⁶ Mr. Sharp, on page 52 of CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE, supra note 4, concluded the third chapter of his book by stating “[t]here is no black and white, mechanical rule in the law of conflict management that clearly defines what a use of force is under all circumstances.” He then followed that statement by using the opposite of the “bully dilemma” to demonstrate his conclusion that a use of force is a question of fact which must be subjectively analyzed: “For example, a state’s activity that is lawful against another state of equal size may nevertheless be significant enough against a smaller state to cross Article 2(4)’s ‘political independence’ threshold.” A subjective “size matters” approach to law provides no clarity and leaves smaller states wondering whether they can seek international assistance or defend themselves.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 71\nacquiesce to the aggression. The smaller state will likely determine that it is better to suffer outright defeat than to attempt to stop the aggression and fail. Meanwhile, as noted above, sanctions under the U.N. Charter are rarely invoked against the “bully” state, especially when the “bully” state is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and therefore holds a veto.\nHowever, in contrast to the historical “bully dilemma,” as depicted above, the asymmetric nature of operations in cyberspace now allows any party to possess the capability to swiftly act in self-defense with incredible lethality. The “bully” could soon be extinct and a new era of conflict could unfold, where the appearance of parity could inspire more breaches of the peace.¹⁷ This is why the development of law in this area must move forward.\n## C. Looking to Jus in Bello to Define Armed Attack\nThe potential lethality of cyberspace responses and unique attributes of cyberspace should compel international lawyers to consider the right of self-defense against cyberspace attacks in light of both the *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum*. Beginning with *jus in bello*, the focus of the examination is whether the current laws and definitions provide sufficient clarity to help nation states resolve what is an armed attack in cyberspace. Unfortunately, international law fails to define “armed attack”. The Geneva Conventions and additional documents relating to the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), *jus in bello*, do provide definitions of related terms that can clarify what international law would likely consider an armed attack. The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols are “not a separate paradigm of conflict management,” but are focused on *jus in bello* issues.¹⁸\nArticle 49 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I) defines “attack” as “acts of violence against the\n¹⁷ To use a college football analogy, the spread of the “West Coast Offense” to many universities has resulted in non-traditional powerhouse programs rising up and defeating Goliaths of the gridiron. Boise State University’s BCS victory over the University of Oklahoma highlights how smaller teams with allegedly lower quality recruits can use a new method of attack to level the playing field. In cyberspace operations, what is to stop a small nation state from responding with a non-attributable cyberspace operation in response to perceived threats or incursions by a “bullying” superpower? Even if the smaller state is questioned, it could respond that it is acting in self-defense to what it considered an armed attack with necessary actions to protect it from further harm. Such an asymmetric shift in warfare could result in an increasing number of “cyberspace conflicts” much like the low intensity conflicts of the 1980s. However, the capacity for “cyberspace conflicts” to rapidly escalate in lethality, due to self-defense actions, could be an incentive for nation states to instead look for a model that promotes deterrence.\n¹⁸ SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 77.\n72 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nadversary.\"¹⁹ The official commentary for Protocol I further adds that the definition “refers simply to the use of armed force to carry out a military operation.”²⁰ Note that because this definition requires the use of armed force, non-military personnel hacking into the New York Stock Exchange and causing substantial economic harm would not be an attack.²¹ Such an application identifies practical limitations with the current definition in Article 49.\nCommon Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions states that the Conventions shall apply during “any other armed conflict,” yet that term is not well defined in the conventions.²² The official commentary to Common Article 2 helps in understanding what is an armed conflict and states that “de facto hostilities” are sufficient. The commentary then makes clear the Conventions’ intention for a low threshold and broad application of the term “armed conflict”:\nThe substitution of this much more general expression for the word \"war\" was deliberate. One may argue almost endlessly about the legal definition of \"war.\" A\n¹⁹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/470?OpenDocument. The United States has not ratified Protocol I, but it is accepted as customary international law. It is interesting to note that Article 49 further states:\n[The] provisions of this section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.\n*Id.* International law recognizes distinctions with regard to conducting hostilities in the domains of air and sea, yet there is no strong movement for international recognition of the distinctive qualities of the domain of cyberspace.\n²⁰ Commentary for Protocol I, art. 49, para. 1882, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=470&amp;t=com.\n²¹ Even in 1977, international law failed to grasp the importance of economic battles that could bring a country to its knees.\n²² The four Geneva Conventions were signed on 12 August 1949. Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3114, 75 U.N.T.S. 31; Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3217, 75 U.N.T.S. 85; Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135; Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 75 U.N.T.S. 287. The Conventions and their commentaries are available on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) web page at: http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView. The Geneva Conventions represent customary international law with regard to the conduct of armed hostilities or *jus in bello*.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 73\nState can always pretend, when it commits a hostile act against another State, that it is not making war, but merely engaging in a police action, or acting in legitimate self-defence. The expression \"armed conflict\" makes such arguments less easy. Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, or how much slaughter takes place.²³\nIn addition to the above statement, each of the four commentaries to the Geneva Conventions provides slightly different amplifying language for Article 2. This is, no doubt, due to the specific context of each of the four Geneva Conventions. For example, with respect to the First Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, the Commentary adds:\nThe respect due to human personality is not measured by the number of victims. Nor, incidentally, does the application of the Convention necessarily involve the intervention of cumbrous machinery. It all depends on circumstances. If there is only a single wounded person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .²⁴\n²³ Commentary to Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions. The quoted language is repeated in paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of each of the four Geneva Conventions. Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/365-570005?OpenDocument; Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/370-580005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600005?OpenDocument.\n²⁴ Id. Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Geneva Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12 1949, provides almost identical language, with a minor distinction regarding shipwrecked persons: “If there is only a single shipwrecked person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .” Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the\n74 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nThus, what is clear from the Commentaries regarding when an “armed conflict” has occurred is not the number or persons involved or whether the parties are using “cumbrous machinery”, such as tanks, rockets, planes, etc., or “even if there has been no fighting,” but simply whether there is “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces.” Further, a consistent theme is that “armed conflict” usually involves some sort of negative impact on at least one person, even if it is a civilian victim. The Commentary language begs the question—a question not answered—what is “intervention of the armed forces?”\nIn sum, this discussion of the Geneva Conventions as they relate to *jus in bello* reveals that “armed conflict” is an activity that involves acts of violence between armed forces, which affect at least one person, regardless of the amount of damage or suffering inflicted. Overall, the threshold is quite low and certainly does not require significant damage or loss of life. The policy concern to protect people from the harsh effects of conflict most likely inspired such a low, almost bright-line approach. While the definitions and Official Commentaries of the Conventions help explore the issue, the U.N. Charter remains the principal document for analyzing *jus ad bellum* issues relevant to the armed attack determination.\n## D. Armed Attack and Jus ad Bellum\nUnfortunately, the U.N. Charter itself provides very little by way of definition when it comes to the term, “armed attack.” Moreover, no official commentary addresses the issue. However, one place scholars have turned for clarification is the U.N. General Assembly’s 1974 resolution defining aggression, Resolution Number 3314. In that resolution, the General Assembly defined aggression as the “use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or\nConvention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12 1949, provides the following minor distinction:\nIt makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces; it suffices for the armed forces of one Power to have captured adversaries falling within the scope of Article 4. Even if there has been no fighting, the fact that persons covered by the Convention are detained is sufficient for its application. The number of persons captured in such circumstances is, of course, immaterial.\nParagraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War simply clarifies with regard to civilians that the “respect due to the human person as such is not measured by the number of victims.”\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 75\npolitical independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\"²⁵ More importantly, the resolution provides a number of specific acts that constitute aggression, including, but not limited to:\nInvasion, attack or military occupation; bombardment or the use of any weapons against a State; blockade; an attack on the land, sea, or air forces or the marine and air fleets of a State; and the sending of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries to complete any of the previous acts.²⁶\nThe resolution states that it may limit a finding of aggression in light of relevant circumstances, such as when the act is not of \"sufficient gravity.\" The pragmatic tone of this qualifying language is more consistent with how nation states subjectively conclude whether an armed attack occurred.²⁷ The term \"sufficient gravity\" may be an unintended endorsement of the \"bully dilemma.\" Thus, the \"bully\" state again avoids accountability when the international community determines its small-scale aggression is not of \"sufficient gravity,\" i.e. the international community is not sufficiently concerned about their own safety and security. Unfortunately, subjective conclusions do not add much clarity to resolving what acts would be considered an armed attack in cyberspace. As noted above, such definitional clarity is essential to aiding all states in understanding which acts in cyberspace can result in self-defense actions. If there was a legal framework, which created a clearer understanding of one's accountability in cyberspace, there would be a greater likelihood of deterring states from acting\n²⁵ G. A. Res. 3314, U.N. GAOR, 29th Sess., art. 1 (Dec. 14, 1974) available at http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/29/ares29.htm. This language is almost identical to the language found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n²⁶ Id. art. 3.\n²⁷ Mr. Sharp accurately notes that the United States uses the factors of scope, duration and intensity to determine whether de facto hostilities exist, but notes that the application has been inconsistent. When a Navy A-6 crew was shot down over Syria in 1983 and one of the crew members was captured, the U.S. claimed POW status for Lt Goodman and stated that “‘armed conflict’ includes any situation in which there is hostile action between the armed forces of two parties, regardless of the duration, intensity or scope of the fighting.” (emphasis added by this author) This is contrasted with the later U.S. position regarding the status of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant as an unlawful detainee, since the U.N. operations in Somalia “did not rise to the level of de facto international armed conflict.” SHARP, supra note 4, at 61-62. Essentially, Mr. Sharp’s position is that the U.S. position has evolved and now relies on the conjunctive “and” when applying the three factors of scope, duration, and intensity, versus the disjunctive “or.”\n76 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\naggressively in cyberspace, because they would know which acts could result in a cyberspace self-defense action.²⁸\nWhether one looks to the “Schmitt analysis” using six factors or Sharp’s approach of “heuristic analysis” to develop a profile of how states apply the factors of scope, duration, and intensity to the U.N. Charter and Common Article 2 framework, there appears to be no clear answer in contemporary international law. Mr. Sharp, quoting Ian Brownlie, attempted to illustrate how international law can be applied during an international incident: “the minor nature of an attack” helps to prove the “intention to attack, of honest mistake, or simply the limited objectives of an attack.”²⁹ Brownlie’s observation made sense in the days of conventional weapons and minor border skirmishes or incursions. One or two shots fired by a border guard versus dropping two 1,000 pound bombs can circumstantially help determine intent. Generally, with such kinetic attacks, the first or second order effects are readily discernable. However, warfare has changed and a new domain has evolved.\nIn cyberspace, what may appear as a “minor attack” could evolve into something much more destructive to a nation state, taking days or months to cause observable, significant harm. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks, and cyberspace attacks are quite different from the traditional methods of massing forces and building up logistics trains and lines of communication. States can much more easily identify preparation for a kinetic invasion versus a cyberspace onslaught. Asymmetric warfare may require asymmetric application of the law to provide the clarity and enforceability capable of promoting peace. The development of international law related to activities in cyberspace should not be delayed any longer.³⁰\nAnd why is finding a legally clear answer so difficult? In his writing, Sharp recognizes the concerns with a strict interpretation of Common Article 2, since such a “rote” application of the Article 2 threshold “intentionally causes military personnel to become belligerents and lawful targets even though they are conducting a peacetime military operation.”³¹ Sharp’s concern regarding a strict\n²⁸ Recall the conclusion of supra note 17 regarding how the asymmetric nature of cyberspace warfare could result in an increasing number of conflicts, all with the potential of having substantially greater effects than traditional low intensity conflicts. This asymmetric nature has created a potential deterrence vacuum, which the law must attempt to fill and states must then enforce.\n²⁹ SHARP, supra note 4, at 66 (quoting IAN BROWNLEIE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES, 366 (1954)).\n³⁰ I refer the reader to the two lead-off quotes at the beginning of this article. The lack of clear, enforceable law will only embolden activities in cyberspace and increase international tension and the likelihood of substantial physical damage in addition to the on-going intellectual carnage.\n³¹ SHARP, supra note 4, at 65-66.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 77\napplication of Common Article 2 to *jus ad bellum*, conflict management, is certainly justified with regard to the evolution of conventional military activities, such as peacekeeping and peacemaking.\nCyberspace operations, however, do not create the same concerns related to peacekeeping operations. There has been no move to create a U.N. “cyberspace peacekeeping force” to engage in online actions to enforce U.N. resolutions or sanctions, and cyberspace forces are not conducting humanitarian missions. In addition, neither Common Article 2, the U.N. Charter, nor the U.N. definition of aggression are contemporary enough to be strictly applied to activities in cyberspace, since they lack definitions applicable to the unique methods used in cyberspace operations. Nevertheless, the policy objective and low threshold of Common Article 2 provide hope that international law is capable of applying a stricter, definition-based approach to cyberspace attacks. The need for a legally clear answer should help shift the focus from an ambiguous, effects-based approach that relies solely on international law to the development of a definition-based approach capable of consistent application to cyberspace operations that affect other states.\n## E. Weapons are the Key\nThe U.N. General Assembly’s defined aggression to include the use of “any weapons” against another state. The use of such a clearly broad term as “any” logically implies that the use of even minor weapons against a state could be considered an act of aggression, if the circumstances are of “sufficient gravity.” Leaving aside the inevitably ambiguous discussion of events that may be of “sufficient gravity” in the eyes of the U.N. General Assembly, the General Assembly’s inclusion of the use of weapons in its definition of aggression brings the discussion regarding armed attacks in cyberspace back to the initial proposal of analyzing cyberspace attacks using the criminal law model.\nThe criminal law model’s reliance on clear definitions requires us to focus on the causative event, versus emphasizing the effects. For example, a crime is committed when a person fires a gun toward another, regardless of whether the other person is actually struck by a bullet. The minimum crime is some type of assault, likely an aggravated one, in the absence of a legal defense. If the person is struck by the bullet (effect of attack) or other circumstances are developed to indicate a more serious intent, then the chargeable crimes range from aggravated assault to murder. As this example demonstrates, under a criminal law approach, a crime (attack) occurred under all of the factual variations. The increase in harm (effect) only increases the level of punishment the offender may face from society and does not influence whether a crime of some sort occurred.\n78 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nRegardless of the severity of the crime (attack), societies have long recognized the policy interest in taking measures to respond to and deter crimes. This deterrence objective is a philosophical difference between a criminal law approach and an effects-based approach relying on international law. International law, relying upon an effects-based threshold, is implicated only when an incident’s consequences rise above a certain threshold. Whereas the criminal law model reacts even if there is just an attempt to commit a prohibited act. Thus, a criminal law approach focuses on the actual act and the method used, whether accessing a computer without proper authorization or robbing a bank with a gun. Relying on the criminal law approach allows one to examine the genesis of an attack at an even deeper level. The criminal law approach strives to provide clarity and consistency, allowing all members of a society to know what conduct is prohibited, which also serves the additional objective of deterrence. In the case of defining cyberspace attacks, a consideration of cyberspace weapons is the key to providing such clarity.\nThe use of a weapon of some kind is the true genesis of an attack. In fact, the types of weapons available to a state determine the possible attack methodologies.³² Thus, studying weapons is also important to understanding the strategy of potential adversaries. However, for the purpose of providing clarity to the issue of armed attacks in cyberspace, the definition of what is a weapon in cyberspace becomes the foundational question to developing a new approach to international law affecting cyberspace operations.\nWhile the U.N. General Assembly used the term “any weapon” and provided no further definition of what constitutes a weapon, one can turn to the law of armed conflict (LOAC) for assistance. Based on the LOAC’s specific guidance regarding conventional tools of war, conventional militaries tend to have a practical understanding of what are lawful and unlawful weapons. For example, exploding bullets and poisonous gas are unlawful weapons.³³ The LOAC focuses, however, almost completely on kinetic weapons.\nDespite its narrow focus on kinetic weapons, the LOAC has nevertheless struggled to define a “weapon,” and there is currently no\n³² For example, possessing and being able to field deep strike kinetic weapons such as low observable bombers opens up a range of options for a state actor. Likewise, possessing and being willing to use suicide bombers or biological weapons creates a tactical (asymmetric) advantage over adversaries. Thus, being able to conduct operations in cyberspace creates a new line of attack methods.\n³³ Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Oct. 18, 1907, art. 23, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/195?OpenDocument [hereinafter Hague Regulation (IV)].

Instead, Article 36 of Protocol I requires a review of any “new weapon, means or method of warfare” to ensure its use would comply with international law.³⁴ Although the United States has not ratified Protocol I, customary international law requires the review of weapons.³⁵\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has noted that each state tends to have its own definition of “weapon.”³⁶ Even within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) there is no standard definition of “weapon.”³⁷ Thus, each service developed its own definition of weapon, which it uses to determine whether a means or method of warfare requires a legal review in accordance with Article 36 of Protocol I. In the Air Force, paragraph 1 of Air Force Instruction 51-402, Weapons Review, 13 May 1994, defines weapons as “devices designed to kill, injure, or disable people, or to damage or destroy property.” The definition specifically excludes “electronic warfare devices.” The definition also differentiates between effects on people and effects on property, failing to include devices that “disable” property. Meanwhile, the United States Army and Navy each provide a definition of weapon that specifically includes devices that “disable” property.³⁸ Thus, the Army and Navy definitions appear to be more\n³⁴ Throughout the remainder of the discussion, the term “weapon” will be used in lieu of the broader term, “weapon, means or method of warfare.”\n³⁵ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONS LAW DIV., OFFICE OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL, DEP’T OF THE AIR FORCE, AIR FORCE OPERATIONS &amp; THE LAW 25, 48 (1st ed. 2002).

THE KEY TO THIS PUZZLE: CYBERSPACE WEAPONS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW DEFINITION-BASED MODEL\n### A. Defining Cyberspace Weapons\nThe criminal law approach and methodology help resolve the issues of ambiguity, enforceability, and attribution for two reasons. First, it provides strong definitions that can withstand judicial scrutiny and allow for fair application to a variety of fact patterns. A nuance of this first strength is that criminal law definitions must also clearly put everyone on notice as to prohibited activities. The second strength is that the criminal law methodology requires the definition of a prohibited act to have some degree of intent, also known as the scienter element. Relying on these strengths, the criminal law approach creates a definition of a cyberspace crime that is clear, flexible, and requires a minimum level of intent. The criminal law methodology will then enable us to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace crime in order to establish the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nAs noted earlier, the European Union’s Convention on Cybercrime is an international treaty intended to create consistency in criminal laws related to internet activities. Unfortunately, the Cybercrime Convention does not offer a definition of malicious logic or cyberspace weapon. Instead, the Cybercrime Convention identifies specific activities states should criminalize. Logically, the reason to prohibit certain activities is to avoid unwanted effects. The criminal law methodology is able to transform unwanted effects into specific definitions and prohibitions, whereas the current approach under international humanitarian law relies on an ambiguous analysis of facts using undefined prohibitions.\nThe intent of the Cybercrime Convention was to set up a basic framework whereby the parties agreed to create their own state criminal codes to address broadly defined prohibited activities. Because the Convention defines prohibited activities broadly, it does not provide the detailed definitions of actual effects in cyberspace necessary to specifically define a cyberspace weapon. Nevertheless, the Convention’s aspirational criminal law definitions of unlawful activity in cyberspace can help identify the international community’s thoughts\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 81\nregarding unlawful cyberspace effects and thus the weapons that cause those effects. By looking at what types of activities the Cybercrime Convention intends to criminalize, it is possible to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nSpecifically, the Cybercrime Convention provides that the parties will adopt laws that criminalize cyberspace crimes such as: unlawful access, unlawful interception, interfering with data or systems, and computer fraud or forgery.³⁹ Looking at the broad definitions for these offenses under the Cybercrime Convention, terms such as “obtaining,” “damaging,” “deleting,” “deteriorating,” “altering” or “suppressing” data represent a common theme of what happens to electromagnetic data when a cyberspace crime occurs.⁴⁰\nThis criminal law framework parallels the scenarios discussed by many others with regard to armed attacks in cyberspace. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense defines Computer Network Attack as: “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”⁴¹ Whether a cyberspace crime or a cyberspace attack, the goal is to affect someone else’s data, or use data to affect property.\nThe domain of cyberspace is obviously not as physically transparent as the domains of air and space. If one were to try and “fire” one million volts at a cyberspace target, there are too many information nodes, such as routers and switches, along the internet pathway that would become the unintended recipient of the “electromagnetic missile.” The one million volt “electromagnetic missile” would cause\n³⁹ See Convention on Cybercrime, supra note 10, at arts. 2-8.\n⁴⁰ Id. arts. 4, 5. Article 4 provides:\nData interference: 1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data without right. 2. A Party may reserve the right to require that the conduct described in paragraph 1 result in serious harm.\nArticle 5 provides:\nSystem interference: Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.\n⁴¹ JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUB. 1-02, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS 113 (17 Mar. 2009) [hereinafter JP 1-02].\n82 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\ncollateral damage to those nodes and would be worn down long before it reached its intended target. Cyberspace attacks, just like criminal hacks, are designed to affect electromagnetic data in various ways, which then impact the adversary's cyberspace to create an operational advantage for the attacker. Thus, the basic legal framework of the Cybercrime Convention is beneficial in the context of military operations in cyberspace.\nAlthough the Cybercrime Convention does not provide definitions of key terms such as \"damaging\" or \"altering,\" the Cybercrime Convention points us to the criminal codes of party states, such as the United States, to specifically define the actus reus. The criminal code of the United States is considered for several reasons: the United States invented the internet; the United States is arguably the largest user of cyberspace; the United States is a leading prosecutor of cyberspace crimes; and many nations work with the United States to solve cyberspace crimes.\nSection 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes intentionally causing damage to a protected computer.[42] Section 1030 is often used by U.S. Attorneys to prosecute persons who steal or corrupt data located on computer systems and persons who engage in denial of service attacks. Section 1030 defines \"damage\" as \"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.\" This definition of \"damage\" recognizes the reality of what happens during a criminal hack or a cyberspace attack: \"damage\" in cyberspace does not require smashing, burning, or blowing things up. The U.S. Code provides a clear, judicially accepted and internationally recognized definition of damage in the cyberspace realm. By borrowing from this definition, it is possible to logically develop a definition of a cyberspace weapon, the key to the puzzle.[43]\nFrom the above, we see that in its most simple terms, the definition of a weapon is \"something that causes damage.\" Applying the definition of damage from Section 1030, I propose the following definition of a cyberspace weapon: Any capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.[44] Although the proposed definition uses the term\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n83\n“impair” versus the DOD favored term “disable,” the terms are somewhat similar in meaning. The term “disable” requires that a weapon must cause a complete loss of function, while the term “impair” recognizes that malicious software code need only reduce an information system’s capability, i.e. degrade.⁴⁵\n## B. Applying the Definition of a Cyberspace Weapon\nNow that we have defined cyberspace weapon, the remaining challenge is to determine whether the proposed definition works within the context of cyberspace operations and within the current limits of international law. While the first instances of negative code may not have been written with the intent of harming a computer, today the story is quite different. Today, the development of computer code that negatively impacts an information system has evolved and spread like an advanced, persistent plague. The tools of the modern hacker, whether criminal, military, terrorist, geek, or spy, are broadly referred to as malicious logic. While malicious logic can take many forms, the key question for our purposes is: “At what point does malicious logic become a cyberspace weapon, the use of which constitutes an armed attack under international law?” The first part of the question focuses not on the end result but on the “tool” used in cyberspace and whether that tool is a “weapon.” The second part of the question will focus on the weapon’s use in cyberspace.\nFirst, one must consider whether particular cyberspace “tools” constitute weapons under international law. The ICRC Commentary on Article 35 of Additional Protocol I states: “The words ‘methods and means’ include weapons in the widest sense, as well as the way in which they are used.”⁴⁶ Furthermore, the ICRC Guide on New Weapons expounds on the above commentary provision by noting that the legal\n⁴⁵ Again, recall that while the services’ definitions of weapon all used the term “disable,” JP 1-02, supra note 41, uses the term “degrade” when describing Computer Network Attack.\n⁴⁶ Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1402 (for art. 35). Article 35 provides overarching guidance regarding the means and methods of warfare and reads:\nBasic rules - 1. In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. 2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. 3. It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.\nProtocol I, supra note 19, at art. 35.\n84 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nreview requirements of Article 36 apply even to non-lethal weapons based on “the ways in which these weapons are to be used pursuant to military doctrine, tactics, rules of engagement, operating procedures and countermeasures” and also applies to all acquired weapons, whether procured based on military specifications or “off-the shelf.”47 Both the Commentary and the ICRC guide conclude that the analysis regarding whether a weapon is lawful or unlawful should be focused on the weapon’s “normal or expected use.”48\nNext, one must analyze how the proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon can be applied in the real-world context of two recent “cyberspace attacks” in Estonia and Georgia. Considering the realities of these two events, does the proposed definition provide sufficient clarity for use in international law?\nThe cyberspace event in April and May of 2007 in Estonia involved a number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) actions against the networks for the two largest banks, effectively severing all internet communications for two hours and causing partial interruptions thereafter.49 The event also included acts against an Estonian government internet service provider that “disrupted government communications for at least a short period of time.”50 Lastly, the web page for the Estonian Prime Minister was “defaced,” manipulating it to show an alleged apology for moving a Soviet World War II memorial.51 Clearly, the event in Estonia resulted in reduced availability and impaired the integrity of the information located on computer systems in Estonia. Applying the attacker’s methods to the proposed definition, it is clear these methods constituted “cyberspace weapons.”\nThe cyberspace event that occurred in July and August of 2008 in Georgia results in a similar conclusion. Again, a DDoS event targeted the website of the Georgian President, making it unavailable for 24 hours. Attackers also defaced the website with pictures of Adolf Hitler next to the image of the Georgian President, and, using malicious logic, caused websites for other government agencies to lose connectivity.52 Here again, the methods used by cyberspace attackers in Georgia caused a loss of access and impaired the integrity of the data. Consequently, it is appropriate to label these methods as “cyberspace weapons.” The proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon therefore\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 85\n47 ICRC GUIDE ON NEW WEAPONS, supra note 36, at 9–10.\n48 Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1469 (for art. 35).\n49 Kenneth Geers, Cyberspace and the Changing Nature of Warfare, Keynote Speech for NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CDCOE) 9 (Oct. 13, 2008), available at http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/Cyberspace%20and%20the%20Changing%20Nature%20of%20Warfare.pdf (NATO CDCOE can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.ccdcoe.org).\n50 Id.\n51 Id.\n52 NATO COOPERATIVE CYBER DEFENCE CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE, supra note 2, at 28-33.\nprovides the degree of clarity to move the discussion forward to defining a cyberspace attack.\n## C. When is the Use of a Cyberspace Weapon a Cyberspace Attack?\nAcknowledging that cyberspace weapons were used in the events in Estonia and Georgia does not answer the ultimate question of whether the acts should be considered armed attacks under international law? Here again, the temptation is to return to an effects-based analysis to answer the question. However, as noted at the beginning of this article, previous attempts to answer the question using such an analysis provide ambiguous answers at best. Instead, by applying a definition-based approach, much like the criminal law does, there is a higher likelihood of reaching a clear answer. Therefore, in order to determine when the use of a cyberspace weapon constitutes an “armed attack” under international law, one must look to how the cyberspace weapon is used rather than its effects.\nThis question of how a weapon is used is the key transitional point in this analytical approach and borrows substantially from the criminal law. For example, a gun can either be a weapon used to kill people or a weapon used to assist a hunter in gathering food. The intent of the user remains the primary issue under the criminal law. Using this criminal law approach will enable conversion of the above question into a definition applicable to the international law arena.\nTo prove an offense under the criminal law, almost all crimes require proof of *mens rea*, the idea of a criminal intent or purpose. Specifically, most crimes require proof of either specific or general intent or knowledge. The most difficult *mens rea* to prove is specific intent, whereas knowledge is much more easily inferred from the circumstances. Considering history and the unwillingness of state actors to admit their actual intent, proving the specific or general intent of a state actor is very difficult when relying on circumstantial evidence, and would therefore result in an unenforceable definition beneficial only to academic discussions.\nTherefore, because proof of knowledge is easier to prove than either a specific or general *mens rea*, it will lead to a more enforceable standard and place a higher level of responsibility on states. Even though knowledge is a lower threshold than specific or general intent, it is nevertheless a common and accepted *mens rea* requirement under criminal law. Still, the question remains, knowledge of what? As will be discussed further below, state actors have a responsibility, as sovereigns with power and control, to conduct their affairs with due regard for their international legal obligations when they have knowledge of activities within their legal or physical boundaries. Hence, it is appropriate to consider the following definition of a\n86 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\n\"cyberspace attack\": A cyberspace attack occurs when a state knowingly uses or knowingly acquiesces to an entity under its legal control or within its territory using a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state.\nThe proposed definition of cyberspace attack essentially imposes additional responsibility under international law when a state knowingly allows a person or entity to use a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state. Under the unique circumstances of cyberspace, such a clear definition establishes the increased degree of responsibility necessary to promote international peace and help deter the myriad of adverse activities in cyberspace. Consider the actions of one rogue group if they were to successfully conduct a cyberspace attack against the critical infrastructure of another state. Regardless of the group's motives, whether nationalistic, ideological, or criminal, causing the death of several hundred people and millions of dollars worth of property damage is a scenario that international law must evolve to address and deter. Still, if the state is completely unaware of a rogue element's activities, then it seems appropriate not to impart responsibility and accountability under international law.\nHowever, what if the state that can legally control the rogue element knew that the element was about to or was currently engaging in a cyberspace attack against persons or property in the victim state? The responsible state could, if necessary, disrupt all communications originating from the rogue element or emanating from the state until it could locate and arrest the attackers for violating their domestic laws. The definition of a cyberspace attack, although similar to the definition of a cyberspace crime, is not intended to hold states responsible for the nefarious efforts of criminals, unless the state is aware of the criminal's efforts and knowingly acquiesces to the use of a cyberspace weapon. The objective is to develop a legal framework that inspires states to cooperate to eliminate the harmful use of cyberspace—to create deterrence.\nWithout the proposed legal framework, why should a state try to stop an impending cyberspace attack against another state? Under current state practice, if the victim state is an \"ally,\" then the responsible, \"host\" state will likely feel much more compelled to take positive steps to stop the attack. For example, if a hacker in the United Kingdom was conducting a cyberspace attack against the Hoover Dam in the United States, U.K. security and law enforcement officials would almost certainly act with all diligence to stop the attack and arrest the perpetrators, and would likely allow their extradition to the United States.[53] However, how many cyberspace events against entities in the\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n87\nUnited States has the People’s Republic of China informed the United States about, and how many times have they stopped and subsequently arrested the offenders? This question indicates the problem with the current model of international law that relies on state practice, subjective assessments, alliances and the “bully dilemma.” International law is currently too vague, as noted by the lead-off quote from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\nSome argue that international law may not be inclined to place such a clear responsibility on states for acquiescing to uses of cyberspace weapons, unless they caused effects equivalent to more traditional armed attacks.⁵⁴ However, the United Nations has issued resolutions that appear to place a higher burden on states to refrain from acquiescing to certain acts committed from their territory against other states. For example, a General Assembly Resolution in 1970, number 2625, discussed acquiescence and said that states have a duty to refrain from acquiescing or tolerating actions from within its territory that cause civil strife in the other state.⁵⁵ More recently, the United Nations\nof U.S. military servers in 2001 and 2002.

The key excerpts from the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among states in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations are:\nEvery State has a duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting, or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force . . .\nAlso, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State. . .\nStates have the duty to co-operate with one another, irrespective of the differences in their political, economic and social systems, in the various spheres of international relations, in order to maintain international peace and security . . .\nAll states enjoy sovereign equality. They have equal rights and duties . . .\nThe principles of the Charter which are embodied in this Declaration constitute basic principles of international law . . .\n88 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nSecurity Council issued Resolution 1373 on September 28, 2001, which reaffirmed the key principles in Resolution 2625. Resolution 1373 decided under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that all states shall take the necessary steps to prevent terrorist acts, to prevent terrorists from using their territories for terrorist purposes, and to provide early warning to other states.⁵⁶\nAlthough not directly on point with all scenarios of cyberspace attack, some cyberspace attacks could fit within the resolutions’ already accepted prohibitions related to harboring terrorists, preventing use of territory by terrorists, and acquiescing to those who cause civil strife. The proposed definition of armed attack in cyberspace would really only increase the degree of state responsibility for non-state actors by a small amount. In light of the growing concern related to the impact of non-state actors on international peace, and considering the asymmetric and potentially dangerous attributes of cyberspace, such an increase in state responsibility is not unreasonable.\nThe strength of the proposed definition of cyberspace attack is that it would place a clear responsibility on all states. All states would know what international law requires and non-state actors would know that their actions could be considered armed attacks. Although clear and strict in comparison to the current approach, the proposed legal threshold is not improperly low. It has a reasonable *mens rea* requirement, to wit: the host state must have knowledge of the impending or ongoing use of a cyberspace weapon. Because the proposed definition requires knowing acquiescence, a state can claim the defense of impossibility. For example, the host state may have no knowledge of an ongoing cyberspace attack because the rogue element first hacked into and gained control of the entire host state’s communications infrastructure. Still, once the host state became aware of the intended location of the attack, it would then be responsible to at least communicate that information to the victim state and continue to take reasonable measures to stop or impede the attack and cooperate with the victim state.\nThe unique attributes of cyberspace, such as its speed and lack of physical borders, are key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory when they do not take reasonable measures to stop the attack and warn the victim state. One cannot overemphasize the potency of the asymmetric capabilities of cyberspace in comparison to any other war-fighting domain in the world’s history, a capability that enables almost any person to engage in actions with\n⁵⁶ S.C. Res. 1373, U.N. SCOR, 4385th mtg., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1373 (Sept. 28, 2001) condemning the terrorist attacks of 9-11 and stating that “those responsible for aiding, supporting or harboring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of such acts will be held accountable.”); see also G.A. Res. 56/1, U.N. GAOR, 56th Sess., U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/1 (Sept. 12, 2001).\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 89\nlethal and costly effects. Therefore, another difference between the proposed definition and current requirements under international law is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack does not include a requirement that the attack involve the armed forces of the aggressor, as the commentary to Common Article 2 requires and the U.N. definition of aggression implies. However, the U.N. definition of aggression clearly includes mercenaries and irregulars. Once more, considering the asymmetric nature of cyberspace, requiring a cyberspace attack to involve the armed forces or mercenaries of the aggressor would create a legal hole big enough for hundreds of thugs and brigands to \"attack\" the victim state. In consideration of the incredible amount of physical or information damage that non-state actors can cause in cyberspace, knowing acquiescence to such attacks is the correct standard for imposing state responsibility under international law.\nBut, is it fair to impose such strict accountability on the use of cyberspace, when some cyberspace attributes, such as ease of access and use, are similar to those of global commons? For example, some may argue that the proposed definition is contrary to Article 8 of the Hague Regulation (V).[57] Article 8 provides that “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” It is accepted that many cyberspace communications occur over “telephone cables” and similar telecommunications infrastructure. Thus, the language of Article 8 is applicable to cyberspace operations. Article 8 clearly does not place a duty on a neutral power to forbid or restrict belligerents from using their communications infrastructure. In fact, Article 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) states that any restrictive measures implemented by a neutral power must be equally applied to “both belligerents.” Article 8’s language, therefore, appears to contradict the proposed definition.\nAlternatively, one could argue that the proposed definition of cyberspace attack does not conflict with Article 8, because the proposed definition creates a transitional status for a state. Once a state becomes aware of a cyberspace attack originating from its territory and targeting another state, it is no longer a \"neutral power\" and now must act to stop the attack or become a de facto \"belligerent.\" The idea of a state transitioning between being a neutral power and a belligerent may be too tenuous for realistic application in international law. In the alternative, states could choose, when adopting the proposed definition\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nof cyberspace attack, to explicitly state that Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) no longer apply to cyberspace.\nGoing back to the Estonia and Georgia events, most media attributed the use of cyberspace weapons to Russian internet addresses. Despite early and widespread media attribution to Russia, the attacks continued, strongly implying that Russia was directly responsible for the attacks.⁵⁸ Apparently, Russian law enforcement and security services made no effort to stop the cyberspace attacks.⁵⁹ Russia was certainly on notice that the world community believed the cyberspace attacks were originating from within its borders. While circumstantial evidence clearly indicated that Russia knowingly acquiesced to these attacks, there was no direct evidence. Reviewing the circumstantial evidence under the proposed definition indicates that Russia violated international law and the victim states had the right of self-defense. However, relying on circumstantial evidence is not something the international community and international law are generally comfortable doing.\nThis lack of direct evidence is indicative of the attribution problem currently hindering all investigations of actions in cyberspace. Investigators of domestic cyberspace crimes meticulously use forensic tools to identify which specific internet protocol (IP) address is responsible for a cyberspace crime and then interview the suspect to determine their level of knowledge or intent. Unfortunately, overseas investigations can only be accomplished if there is cooperation between the involved states. When a foreign state does not provide equal access to forensic evidence and suspects, the attribution barrier obstructs the inquiry and protects the “attacker.” Such actions do not promote peace or resolve conflict.\nThe effects-based model would likely conclude that the Estonia and Georgia attacks were not severe enough to be considered armed attacks or even an unlawful use of force. There were no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack. The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy. Reviewing the international reaction after the fact, there were no declarations by the international\n⁵⁸ Arthur Bright, *Estonia accuses Russia of ‘cyberattack,’* CHRISTIAN SCI.

Charter or that they created de facto hostilities under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions. Estonia chose not to consider them armed attacks, while the Georgia situation simultaneously devolved into a kinetic conflict. What option did Estonia really have? If Estonia felt it had sufficient attribution, Estonia could have considered the acts armed attacks, creating a de facto state of hostilities and requested the assistance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under the NATO Treaty’s collective self-defense provision.⁶⁰ Estonia could have waited for NATO to risk war with Russia. Estonia could also have responded in self-defense with conventional, kinetic forces, since they did not have any “cyberspace forces.” The potential result could have been a strong conventional response from Russia, including occupation of Estonia. Again, the “bully dilemma” reared its head. This prompts the question, is it fair to rely on a 60 year-old conventional model that gives such weight to state practice when the kinetic forces and available cyberspace capabilities are so disproportionate?\nIndeed, continued reliance on such a model could lead “minor” states to develop cyberspace forces in an effort to achieve an asymmetric advantage over states with much larger kinetic capabilities, leading to a cyberspace arms race and possibly more conflicts. As the Estonia and Georgia events demonstrate, when a state knowingly chooses to not assist a victim state or hold responsible those who use cyberspace weapons against other states, international law should view that state as a transgressor.\nThat is what the proposed definition of cyberspace attack intends to do. The proposed definition will have a positive impact on international law and conflict management, because it will clearly place\n⁶⁰ North Atlantic Treaty art. 5, Apr. 4, 1949, 63 Stat. 2241, 34 U.N.T.S. 243. Article 5 states:\nThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.\n92 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nresponsibility on all states to not engage in cyberspace attacks and to police and secure their cyberspace “borders.”⁶¹ Essentially, everyone will know a cyberspace attack when they see it, and everyone will know that any state that conducts or permits such an attack could suffer self-defense actions and international sanctions. The end result would hopefully be a dramatic decrease in cyberspace events of foreign origin, which would also reduce the likelihood of a cyberspace “arms race” and cause the de-escalation of low intensity conflicts in cyberspace.\n## D. Flies in the Ointment: Attribution and Espionage\nAs referenced above, an effects-based approach magnifies the attribution problem, because it requires attribution of intentional direct participation or support by the state actor, versus knowing acquiescence. The difficulty of attribution in cyberspace prevents the evolution of realistic customary norms.⁶² No state actor can realistically consider the full spectrum of actions, because they do not know who acted against them or why. In addition, the difficulty in comprehending the full severity of the “attack,” because of the delayed effects of cyberspace weapons, compounds the difficulty in determining an appropriate response.\nUnlike the effects-based approach, the proposed definition does not require determining who controlled or supported the activity, the aggressor’s intent, or the full magnitude of the attack. Using the\n⁶¹ The concept of boundaries and sovereignty in cyberspace is also a topic of discussion amongst academics and practitioners. Although there is no clear definition and enforcement of boundaries in cyberspace, all states should recognize that electronic communications of all types originate in one state and can terminate (and have effects) in another state. Therefore, a state can monitor communications occurring inside its geographic borders. For example, the NSA under the Terrorist Surveillance Program was able to monitor communications where one party was located “outside” the United States. White House Press Briefing, Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales &amp; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, Principal Deputy Dir. of Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2005/intell-051219-dni01.htm. The concept of cyberspace borders has even been expanded to include discussions of a cyberspace Monroe Doctrine with regard to cyberspace infrastructure associated to the United States. See Reviewing the Federal Cybersecurity Mission: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Homeland Sec., Sub-Comm. on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, &amp; Sci. &amp; Tech., 110th Cong. (2009) (statement of Mary Ann Davidson, Oracle Security Officer), available at http://homeland.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20090310143850-78976.pdf.\n⁶² Relying on a heuristic analysis of past actions is somewhat similar to how scientists conduct scientific experiments and then analyze the results. In order for scientific experiments and their results to be reliable, external factors must be eliminated or controlled, and all other factors must be accurately known. The lack of attribution makes it impossible to accurately complete a heuristic analysis, since three of the most important factors, identity, intent, and full severity of attack, will rarely be known without it.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 93\ndefinitional approach, only two questions need to be resolved. First, was a cyberspace weapon used against the property or persons of a state? Second, did a foreign state knowingly allow an entity under its legal control to use the cyberspace weapon against the victim?\nEven with the proposed definitions and a two element test, one of the oldest arts, espionage, can still take advantage of the attribution difficulties in cyberspace. Espionage has long been recognized as essential to the success of states and their militaries.⁶³ While a criminal offense in virtually every nation state, espionage is not a violation of the law of war and was first recognized in the Lieber Code in 1863.⁶⁴ It was subsequently codified in the 1907 Hague Regulations and in Protocol I.⁶⁵ Acts deemed to be espionage will not trigger a state’s right to self-defense, because espionage does not violate international law. Based on the definitions from the various documents considered part of customary international law, the consistent requirement for espionage is that a member of the armed forces gathers or attempts to gather information under false pretenses or while not wearing their uniform.\nSuch a definition does not perfectly transfer over to espionage in cyberspace. Whether the person at the other computer terminal is wearing his uniform is irrelevant to attributing his identity and intent in cyberspace. Still, a cyberspace spy will intrinsically gain access to the information or data under false pretenses. The average cyberspace intruder does not disclose his identity nor does he come to the main web page and ask the webmaster for permission. Instead, he exploits vulnerabilities in software coding that allow him to gain unauthorized access, which is essentially under false pretenses as discussed in Article\n⁶³ Sun Tzu stated: “So, as for enlightened lords or distinguished commanders, the reason they can overcome the adversary when action is taken and achieve unparalleled success is prescience. Prescience cannot be gained from ghost or gods . . . . It must be gained from what is learned by men.” SUN TZU, SUN TZU: THE NEW TRANSLATION 112 (J. H. Huang trans. 1993).\n⁶⁴ FRANCIS LIEBER, INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIELD, ART. 88 (Apr. 24, 1863), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/110?OpenDocument [hereinafter LIEBER CODE]. Article 88 defines a spy as: “a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy.”\n⁶⁵ Article 29 of Hague Regulation (IV), supra note 33, defines a spy thus:\n[A]cting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information, are not considered spies.\nArticle 46 of Protocol I, supra note 19, provides that a member of the armed forces shall not be considered a spy “unless he does so through an act of false pretences or deliberately in a clandestine manner.”\n94 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\n29 of Hague Regulation IV. Even when an intruder sends an e-mail directly to an authorized user, asking the user to provide his password information, the e-mail is still sent under false pretenses.⁶⁶\nIt is certainly possible for cyberspace spies to gain access to information and copy or degrade the data without the use of a cyberspace weapon. However, the tension between lawful espionage and armed attack in cyberspace occurs when a spy uses a cyberspace weapon to access or steal information. If a traditional spy uses a weapon, such as a pistol, the act is viewed as a criminal act, versus an armed attack. Should the same be true of a cyberspace spy who hacks into a system by using a cyberspace weapon? Applying the proposed definition of cyberspace attack, the use of a cyberspace weapon while committing espionage in or through cyberspace could be interpreted as a cyberspace attack and result in self-defense actions.\nThe only way to resolve the tension between cyberspace espionage and cyberspace attack is to determine whether the cyberspace intruder intends solely to copy and then steal the data or information. Again, this dilemma adds a layer of complexity to the attribution issue by now requiring a determination of the actor’s full intent, creating an untenable situation for the victim state. Given that actions happen so fast in cyberspace, a spy or attacker could move “in and out” before a victim state could do any more than determine the foreign internet protocol (IP) address of the intruder. A full damage assessment, identifying what happened to the victim computer system could take hours to weeks. While some cyberspace attacks may be obvious, many will not be, as the beauty of cyberspace warfare is the ability to create second and third order effects, which are difficult to identify in advance.\nThe attribution issue reaches a pinnacle of complexity when trying to resolve events between espionage and cyberspace attacks. Therefore, today, a victim state is left with three choices: (1) continue to operate in the current international system of subjective analysis and inconsistent past responses while ineffectively trying to gather very detailed attribution information; (2) develop a robust cyberspace force capable of conducting cyberspace attacks, cyberspace espionage, and able to “hack back” to develop reasonably detailed attribution information; (3) or issue an ultimatum to the international community, hoping that others will agree, which informs all other states that any activity in that state’s territory that is determined to satisfy the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack will justify self-defense actions by the victim state.\n⁶⁶ Phishing or spear phishing emails target known users on a network and always provide a false reason for the recipient to provide key information or click on a hyperlink that will then redirect the user to another web page where malicious code, read weapon, will be surreptitiously installed on the user’s computer.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 95\nThe difficulty with resolving the espionage issue is that under the first option a state remains vulnerable to many forms of cyberspace attack while attempting to resolve whether the event is an act of espionage or cyberspace attack and waiting for the international community to subjectively analyze the evidence. In addition, the evidence to satisfy the international community would likely include the elusive proof of actual intent to harm the victim state. Adversarial states could choose to take advantage of this slow analysis and decision loop, achieving paralysis by analysis, and methodically weaken a state with what appears to be cyberspace espionage but is in fact a number of cyberspace attacks aimed at creating third order effects. Lastly, it appears that states are not willingly sharing the details of their cyberspace activities with others, which still leaves a void of necessary information to conduct the required heuristic analysis to develop the law under the current framework.\nThe second option will help the state protect itself from adversarial activities in cyberspace and possibly lead to attributable information. In spite of this benefit, the potential of a cyberspace arms race increases. This development could lead to an increase in low scale cyberspace conflicts and ultimately result in an adversary conducting a second or third order cyberspace attack inflicting massive casualties or property damage.67 The continued development of cyberspace capabilities appears to be the current direction of the leading states, such as China, Russia, and the United States. States certainly cannot be faulted for taking such an approach, as the current international legal scheme offers them very little protection yet many opportunities to exploit the cyberspace of other states. Therefore, the race for dominance in cyberspace has begun and may soon grow out of control.\nThe second option also has some parallels to the approach that states took when nuclear tensions were high during the Cold War. The superpowers recognized that conventional methodologies could not be applied to the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). States recognized that Article 51’s right of self-defense limited them to proportional actions. However, due to the overwhelming effect and fairly rapid speed of any nuclear attack, states were doctrinally prepared to respond in full at the first indication of even a limited attack, since they recognized that they could not afford to wait and see how many warheads or which locations the adversary’s warheads hit and how much damage they caused. Superpowers projected that they were capable, prepared, and willing to respond to even a limited, targeted nuclear first-strike with a full-scale response.\n67 Cyberspace attacks against critical infrastructure, aircraft and air traffic control software, navigation systems (GPS), and pharmaceutical companies to alter the code for medicines and vaccines are just some examples of cyberspace attacks that may not have recognizable first order effects, but catastrophic subsequent effects.\n96 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nHistorically, one can see how nation states adopted their practice in light of the dramatic increase in speed and lethality of nuclear attacks using ICBM’s compared to the previous conventional method of warfare, circa World War II. While many decried the age of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and called it “mad,” one cannot dispute that during that time period, even though there was a nuclear arms race, no nuclear weapons were used. Mad or not, MAD was an effective method of deterrence. There are a number of parallels between the use of ICBMs and cyberspace operations: cyberspace attacks have the potential for incredible lethality; much greater speed than previous weapons; and the actual severity of the threat, the intent, and the identity of the actor are usually too difficult to determine in sufficient time to respond appropriately before the damage is done.\nHowever, there is one crucial difference between today’s option two situation (developing a robust cyberspace force and “hacking back”) and the deterrence model of MAD during the Cold War. Currently, it does not appear that a substantial number of states are willing to make a declaration of mutually assured destruction through cyberspace and simultaneously abstain from conducting cyberspace operations. Without such declarations and cessation of the use of cyberspace weapons, the parallels with the Cold War nuclear deterrence model end. Pragmatically, states do not feel the impetus to consider such an approach. There has been no mass disaster or 9-11 type “wake-up call” in cyberspace, and, as noted above, a number of states likely believe they can “win” in cyberspace. Therefore, applying the nuclear deterrence model to cyberspace operations is not practical. Unfortunately, history has shown that society rarely chooses to collectively legislate against harm until after it suffers the consequences.\nStill, there is one historical example where society chose to proactively legislate and limit the weaponization of a domain, much like option three. The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space.⁶⁸ The third option can perhaps draw strength from the efforts to limit the militarization of space, recognizing cyberspace as a sort of international commons similar to outer space. Each state, relying on the proposed definitions, would still retain its sovereignty and control of cyberspace infrastructure located within its borders. The implementation of the proposed definitions would recognize that the use of cyberspace is intended for peace-promoting purposes and the use of weapons in cyberspace, even for espionage purposes, will not be accepted. Providing states the right of self-defense using the lower, clear threshold of the proposed\n⁶⁸ Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Jan. 27, 1967, 6 I.L.M. 386, available at http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 97\ndefinitions will hopefully inspire states to abstain from cyberspace espionage and attacks and cooperate to protect the peaceful use of cyberspace.\n## IV. APPLYING THE DEFINITIONS AND EXERCISING SELF-DEFENSE IN CYBERSPACE\nIn order to further understand how option three’s (issuing an ultimatum that the state could respond in self-defense to cyberspace attacks) use of the proposed definitions will promote peace and reduce the improper use of cyberspace, it is helpful to explore how states could act in response to a cyberspace attack. The doctrine of self-defense relies on two principles: necessity and proportionality. Necessity involves whether effective peaceful means of resolution exist; the nature of the aggression, each party’s objectives, and the likelihood of effective intervention by the international community.⁶⁹ Proportionality requires limiting the magnitude, scope, and duration of the force used in response to that which is reasonably necessary to counter the threat or attack.⁷⁰ The timing of a self-defense action is closely related to the factor of necessity and is a debated issue. A delayed response weakens a state’s claim of necessity to defend itself. While an early response in anticipation of attack also draws questions as to the certainty of need for the self-defense action.\nLooking at necessity and the timing of self-defense actions in cyberspace, the unique qualities of cyberspace again highlight the importance of moving toward a deterrence model. Once a state suffers what it believes to be an armed attack in or through cyberspace, it can arguably satisfy the above requirements of necessity to defend itself. Unfortunately, in cyberspace, there will likely not be sufficient time to consider peaceful resolution of the matter, fully understand the nature of the attack or the intended results, or to mobilize international peacekeeping forces. Thus, the more difficult question related to necessity is how appropriate is anticipatory self-defense in cyberspace?\nAnticipatory self-defense “justifies use of force in anticipation of an ‘imminent’ armed attack.”⁷¹ Basically, a state need not wait to receive the aggressor’s attack and can instead act in self-defense to “repel” the attack.⁷² The doctrine “finds it roots in the 1837 Caroline case and subsequent correspondence between then-U.S. Secretary of\n⁶⁹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK 4 (2007) [hereinafter U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK]; see also YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION AND SELF-DEFENCE (4th ed. 2005).\n⁷⁰ U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 69.\n⁷¹ Id. at 6.\n⁷² Id.\n98 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nState Daniel Webster and his British Foreign Office counterpart Lord Ashburton.\"73 Secretary Webster informed Lord Ashburton that a state can act in self-defense when the circumstances are \"instantaneous, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation.\"74 The attributes of cyberspace, especially speed and lethality, seem quite similar to Secretary Webster's factors. Essentially, if a state is fortunate enough to develop information about a developing or planned cyberspace attack against it, the attributes of cyberspace may compel a state to act in its best interest and exercise anticipatory self-defense.\nThe follow-on question involves what a state can do in self-defense, i.e. how is the principle of proportional response applied in and through cyberspace? In cyberspace, there may be a number of ways to technically counter an attack. A state could disconnect itself from cyberspace. However, such a response seems disproportionately burdensome on the victim state and could cause other forms of harm internally. The victim state could quickly counter with anti-virus measures, although such efforts are always a game of \"catch-up.\" The victim state could respond by disconnecting all cyberspace connections with the aggressor state. However, this will only work as long as the aggressor state chooses not to attack through another state. Moreover, such actions require attribution.\nBecause a state needs to know against which state to exercise self-defense, developing reliable attribution represents another difficulty with applying age-old laws and methods to cyberspace. Given that a cyberspace attack comes from another country and could involve communications \"hopping\" through several other countries, it is nearly impossible for a state to develop attribution without first violating the cyberspace infrastructure and jurisdiction of other states. Currently, to avoid violating another state's cyberspace, states send requests for assistance to cooperating states. The victim state requests help in developing information about the IP address in question and also requests monitoring of that IP address, allowing the state to \"hop back\" to the next IP address, and then request more help. This \"hopping back\" process can be painful and long, leaving the victim state vulnerable. However, the traditional police doctrine of hot pursuit is expanding in international law. Under customary international law, ships and planes can follow offending vessels in hot pursuit up to another state's territorial sea or airspace.75 However, the European Union has adopted the Schengen Agreement that permits law enforcement officials to cross state borders when pursuing a criminal suspected of certain serious\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 99\n73 Id.\n74 Id.\n75 Id. at 541.\noffenses⁷⁶ The agreement provides that the pursuing officers will cease their pursuit upon request of the other state, however, the pursuing officers can request that the other state arrest the suspect.⁷⁷\nExtending the principles of the Schengen Agreement to the domain of cyberspace seems logical, because attacks in cyberspace are analogous to serious criminal offenses. Permitting hot pursuit is consistent with the proposed definition’s efforts to deter states from knowingly acquiescing to cyberspace attacks. Witting host states will find it much harder to hide in the shadow of attribution. Providing victim states with a legal “hot pursuit” capability, including proper coordination mechanisms, will be invaluable to promoting cooperation, reducing crime, and deterring attacks in and through cyberspace.\nWith the ability to more quickly attribute attacks, a state would then have other options to consider under the principle of proportionate response. The victim state could consider firing back in self-defense with a cyberspace weapon at the actual computer(s) used to attack it. This can be reasonably effective if a limited number of computers are involved.⁷⁸ However, a victim state will likely remain concerned, due to its limited ability to determine whether more attacks or attacks of increasing severity will follow the initial round of attacks. This challenge may lead a state to consider more serious measures, such as responding with a self-defense attack that involves disrupting a substantial portion of the witting host state’s cyberspace. However, the collateral damage from such a self-defense action could be substantial. The questions of necessity and anticipatory self-defense also affect the proportionality decision. Moreover, nothing prohibits states from defending against a cyberspace attack by using kinetic weapons, such as striking a key communication node with a cruise missile or damaging a state’s communication satellite(s). The hypotheticals and the potential for conflict abound. Thus, the unique nature of cyberspace and the inability to clearly apply current international laws, norms, and practices make resolution of conflict extremely difficult, and should inspire states to seek a framework of cooperation and deterrence, such as the one I advocate in this article.\n100 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# V. LOOKING FORWARD AND CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\nThe definitions proposed in this article provide a framework for consistency and an opportunity to level the playing field of international law. Today, states can either choose to continue with the status quo, or, recognizing the benefits of the peaceful use of cyberspace, embrace the need for clear definitions of cyberspace weapon and cyberspace attack. Embracing the definitions I propose would, at most, have a moderate impact on how international affairs are conducted today. The Schengen Agreement and the E.U. Convention on Cybercrime serve as models to build a framework of cooperation to promote peace and reduce crime. States would need to establish cyberspace communications centers, whereby each state would agree to pass information to another state as soon as it became aware of a cyberspace attack against a victim state, but is currently unable to halt the attack from affecting the victim state.⁷⁹ The centers would also coordinate the hot pursuit issues related to developing attribution.\nThose states that choose not to adopt the proposed legal definitions and methods of cooperation would do so knowing that their actions or inaction could be viewed as a cyberspace attack. Each state would still continue to exercise its right of self-defense. Meanwhile, the international community could apply the new legal standard when considering whether to apply sanctions. The end result is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack with cooperative application under international law could make a powerful form of asymmetric warfare untenable before it develops into an arms race that leads to increased conflicts and harms people and property.\nWhen our predecessors developed the law of conflict management it is doubtful anyone could foresee the day when a state could attack another state simply by manipulating electronic data. Even the futuristic Buck Rogers and lasers still had visible, kinetic-like effects. Today, one must recognize that the lack of specific definitions for “weapon” and “armed attack” create an untenable vacuum in the evolving domain of cyberspace. So far, only the criminal law has provided thorough definitions in an attempt to keep pace with the development of nefarious tools in cyberspace. The criminal law methodology provides a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt such definitions to the various uses of prohibited cyberspace tools. The field of international law requires similar flexibility. This article attempted to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon from the criminal law’s efforts to specifically define the acts caused by cyberspace criminals.

INTRODUCTION\nChange has come and gone. While academics have been discussing methods to define the use of force in cyberspace, governments and policy makers may have missed an opportunity to shape the law of war. Just like a child “pinching” a peppermint from the candy store while the owner was not looking, someone may have successfully launched two cyberspace attacks, and no one called either one an unlawful use of force or armed attack. Did a state actor set a precedent that could become part of customary international law?\nEvery day there are new stories and developments about the increasing connectivity of people around the world spurred by the continued fast pace of technological developments in the computer and communications industries. Military applications of cyberspace are also rapidly evolving, moving the domain of cyberspace to the front lines of conflicts. But, the legal frameworks that regulate war or armed conflict are lagging far behind the technological changes that have already occurred. Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light. Unfortunately, law, especially international law, failed to keep pace with the new applications of existing technologies. On the criminal front, law enforcement agencies are swamped with allegations ranging from identity theft to theft of corporate data, while armed with only a marginally effective process to investigate, extradite, and prosecute international cyberspace criminals. However, the conduct of military operations in and through cyberspace, with potentially greater global implications, is bypassing the currently inadequate mire of international law. What if international law could provide a framework capable of enabling deterrence in cyberspace?\n U.S.-CHINA ECON. &amp; SEC.

Meanwhile, commercial internet service providers began offering services in the late 1980’s. Today, according to Wikipedia, there are more than 1 billion personal computers in use and more than 1 billion users of the internet. Wikipedia, Personal Computer, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer (last visited Mar. 15, 2009).\n\nScholars have written many articles regarding cyberspace attacks in the international regime and what constitutes a use of force or act of war in cyberspace. Yet, there is no consensus regarding how to define attacks in cyberspace under international law. The unique qualities of operations in cyberspace will make this the most difficult domain in which to resolve international disputes and conflict. In this article, I intend to offer a new methodology for determining armed attacks in cyberspace by using existing criminal law legal tools. Specifically, this methodology will borrow from the criminal law’s definitions of cyberspace crimes, in order to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon. More importantly, by defining cyberspace weapon, this methodology will enable the international community to define what constitutes a cyberspace attack. Providing the legal framework for a definition of cyberspace attack, such as the new methodology outlined in this article, will serve to reduce the potential for conflict in cyberspace.\nThe article will first examine cyberspace and how current approaches have attempted to apply international law to armed attacks in cyberspace. Looking through the lens of current international laws will highlight how the unique attributes of cyberspace could increase the likelihood of international conflict. The article will identify how the failure of international law to define armed attacks and weapons further exacerbates this problem. The article will then transition from current international laws to examine whether current criminal law definitions and methodologies can fill the gap and provide realistic definitions of weapons and armed attacks in cyberspace. Lastly, the article will put these proposed definitions to the test against the most challenging aspects of cyberspace: attribution and espionage.\n See, e.g., Michael N.

APPLYING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBERSPACE ATTACKS: FALLING SHORT WITHOUT DEFINITIONS\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nFor the purposes of this article, I define cyberspace as *an evolving man-made domain for the organization and transfer of data using various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The domain is a combination of private and public property governed by technical rule sets designed primarily to facilitate the flow of information.* The key feature of cyberspace is that it is a man-made domain designed to transfer data and information.\nInformation is the reason cyberspace exists, and this feature makes current discussions involving the international law of conflict management, *jus ad bellum*, so different from traditional *jus ad bellum* discussions. Simply put, information is fundamentally different than the traditional tools of war; bits and bytes bear no physical resemblance to bullets and bombs. Michael Schmitt noted that cyberspace threats differ in four ways from traditional threats: (1) computer networks are a new target category, with computer network attacks capable of providing the same results as striking the traditional target with a kinetic weapon; (2) an attack does not have to use kinetic force and can solely involve a command from one computer to the target system; (3) the intended results are often not kinetic and could simply involve the manipulation of data or disruption of a service; and (4) cyberspace threats are not constrained by political boundaries or geography.\nI would add four more distinguishing factors between cyberspace threats and traditional or kinetic uses of force: (1) cyberspace attacks can be completed literally at the speed of light; (2) the results of some cyberspace attacks, whether intended or not, can be similar to those involving weapons of mass destruction; (3) the cost of acquiring the equipment and expertise to conduct operations in\n---\n This definition was developed jointly with my cyberspace law cohort, Major Noah Bledstein at 8 AF/JA. Major Bledstein has been working on cyberspace law issues since 2003. His assistance in discussing and developing the ideas and definitions in this paper was invaluable. It does not specifically address the issue of whether some part or all of cyberspace should be considered a global commons.\n Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, supra note 4, at 888.\n Because the infrastructure of modern societies relies on the technology and data which can be easily targeted during a cyberspace operation, the disabling of such infrastructure or manipulation of data could cause substantial damage and harm to a society. For example: disabling air traffic control systems or the systems which control the water flowing from a large dam, manipulating the data relied upon by banks or the International Monetary Fund, or manipulating the DNA coding for the subsequent year’s flu vaccine.\ncyberspace is *de minimis* in comparison to fielding conventional forces; and (4) attributing the attack to the responsible party and determining whether the attack was intentional or accidental is extremely difficult.\nThe attribution problem, which this article discusses throughout, is indeed the elusive factor that most severely complicates the application of international law. In fact, the attribution problem makes cyberspace so different from other mediums or domains that it requires an entirely new international law approach. The unique nature of the cyber domain impacts not only national level decisions but also the development of law in this area, as evidenced by the current state of law regarding cyberspace and conflict management, which is discussed below.\n## B. Current Legal Approaches to Cyberspace Attacks\nThe majority of scholars considering attacks in cyberspace have used an ambiguous, effects-based analytical approach relying on international law to determine what constitutes a “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter or whether an “armed attack” occurred under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. The discussions and articles have also looked to other treaties that comprise international law and the law of war, such as the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions. On first impression, an effects-based approach to the issue that relies on\n A nuance of limited attribution is that much of the public is unaware of what is going on in cyberspace. In the other domains where military operations are conducted, the activities are much more visible. However, in cyberspace, we can’t easily spot electrons and data packets whisking by us or through a phone line.\n *See supra* note 4. A brief description of two of the leading approaches follows: First, Gary Sharp’s approach recognizes that a use of force in cyberspace may rise to the threshold of an armed attack, depending on its “scope, duration, and intensity,” which are factors previously relied upon by the United States (*See infra* note 28). Mr. Sharp suggests relying upon an analysis of how states have responded in previous cases to help analyze whether an unlawful use of force or armed attack have occurred, essentially relying on a normative analysis. Mr. Sharp summarizes his test by stating: “What constitutes a use of force of a scope, duration, and intensity that constitutes an armed attack and triggers the law of armed conflict is a question of fact that must be subjectively analyzed in each and every case in the context of all relevant law and circumstances.” SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 69. Michael Schmitt’s analytical approach involves six factors which are used to “délimit” economic/political coercion from determining what is a use of armed force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Mr. Schmitt’s premise for using an effects based approach primarily rests with his assessment that the U.N. Charter was not directly focused on outlawing “force” but rather the “deleterious consequences” of state actions, and outlawing uses of force under Article 2 was a “prescriptive short-hand to achieve their goals.” Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, *supra* note 4, at 911. I would recommend that all practitioners in this area read both works. Mr. Sharp’s book is especially invaluable as a thorough review of international law that applies to cyberspace operations.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 69\ninternational law seems to make sense, since it is electromagnetic data that moves through cyberspace and then creates an electromagnetic effect at the terminating point. The actors certainly focus on what effects they can achieve in and through cyberspace. These effects-based approaches add considerable value to the discussion of the issue, but they are unnecessarily constrained by relying primarily on legal documents and customary international norms developed before the advent of mass-produced computers.\nThe only substantial international legal document developed to address issues related to cyberspace is the European Union's Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention). While the Cybercrime Convention does not address cyberspace attacks as possible acts of war and instead focuses on criminal acts, it does help establish a framework for a new methodology of analyzing cyberspace attacks. Instead of focusing on the end result of a cyberspace event, the effects, and trying to determine whether such an act is a use of force or armed attack under international law, a criminal law methodology places increased emphasis on the genesis of a cyberspace event. The criminal law approach thus focuses on defining the beginning of a cyberspace event and not the effects, and those definitions can then be applied to international law and military operations in cyberspace.\nBefore discussing the benefits of the criminal law approach, however, one must first understand how most commentators are currently applying international law to actions in cyberspace. A review of current scholarship on this issue will show the difficulty in applying decades old terms and norms to actions in cyberspace. As a starting point, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nHowever, without international sanctions there is little incentive for a party to comply with Article 2(4)’s peaceful objectives. The\n Convention on Cybercrime, Nov. 23, 2001, 2296 U.N.T.S. 167, available at http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm.\n U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4\n Id. Art. 1 of the Charter states the purpose of the Charter. Subparagraph 1 specifically states:\nTo maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.\n\nhistorical reality is that most state actors have not conducted themselves as though they feared some form of international punishment for their actions. By itself, Article 2(4) seems, therefore, to create very little deterrent effect in conflict management.\nHowever, in contrast to Article 2(4), Article 51 permits parties to act in self-defense in response to an “armed attack.” Pragmatically, this right of self-defense can have the quickest success at reducing illegal uses of force constituting breaches of the peace, thereby increasing the deterrent effect of international law. While it is important to analyze whether a state action is a threat or use of force, the more critical question is whether the action is an armed attack, authorizing the recipient to respond in self-defense? The right of self-defense puts other states on notice that their offensive actions could be met with military force.\nThe right of self-defense has historically been limited by the reality that smaller nation states would respond against bigger and more powerful states with conventional force only if an attack truly jeopardized its national survival. This could be called the “bully dilemma” of international law. The “bully dilemma” pragmatically disenfranchises smaller and weaker states from the protection of Article 51. If a “bully” state engages in a small-scale breach of the peace against a significantly smaller state that smaller state will likely\n Mr. Sharp reasons “a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), however, the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.” Mr. Sharp recognizes that his position may not be held by all and that any right of self-defense is limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity. SHARP, supra note 4, at 48-49.\n When there is a threat or use of force under Article 2, the United Nations can impose sanctions, to include armed intervention under Chapter 7. However, building the consensus for such actions often takes considerable time and debate, while the victims of such use of force wait for relief. Even the liberation of Kuwait took more than six months before U.N. authorized forces began significant operations to remove Iraqi forces.\n For example, when the United States launched cruise missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan in August 1998, neither country responded with conventional force. The codename for the operation was “Infinite Reach.” What if Sudan had then possessed a capability to respond in cyberspace? How could Sudan respond in cyberspace, and would the U.S. have countered, if attribution could be obtained?\n Mr. Sharp, on page 52 of CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE, supra note 4, concluded the third chapter of his book by stating “[t]here is no black and white, mechanical rule in the law of conflict management that clearly defines what a use of force is under all circumstances.” He then followed that statement by using the opposite of the “bully dilemma” to demonstrate his conclusion that a use of force is a question of fact which must be subjectively analyzed: “For example, a state’s activity that is lawful against another state of equal size may nevertheless be significant enough against a smaller state to cross Article 2(4)’s ‘political independence’ threshold.” A subjective “size matters” approach to law provides no clarity and leaves smaller states wondering whether they can seek international assistance or defend themselves.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 71\nacquiesce to the aggression. The smaller state will likely determine that it is better to suffer outright defeat than to attempt to stop the aggression and fail. Meanwhile, as noted above, sanctions under the U.N. Charter are rarely invoked against the “bully” state, especially when the “bully” state is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and therefore holds a veto.\nHowever, in contrast to the historical “bully dilemma,” as depicted above, the asymmetric nature of operations in cyberspace now allows any party to possess the capability to swiftly act in self-defense with incredible lethality. The “bully” could soon be extinct and a new era of conflict could unfold, where the appearance of parity could inspire more breaches of the peace. This is why the development of law in this area must move forward.\n## C. Looking to Jus in Bello to Define Armed Attack\nThe potential lethality of cyberspace responses and unique attributes of cyberspace should compel international lawyers to consider the right of self-defense against cyberspace attacks in light of both the *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum*. Beginning with *jus in bello*, the focus of the examination is whether the current laws and definitions provide sufficient clarity to help nation states resolve what is an armed attack in cyberspace. Unfortunately, international law fails to define “armed attack”. The Geneva Conventions and additional documents relating to the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), *jus in bello*, do provide definitions of related terms that can clarify what international law would likely consider an armed attack. The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols are “not a separate paradigm of conflict management,” but are focused on *jus in bello* issues.\nArticle 49 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I) defines “attack” as “acts of violence against the\n To use a college football analogy, the spread of the “West Coast Offense” to many universities has resulted in non-traditional powerhouse programs rising up and defeating Goliaths of the gridiron. Boise State University’s BCS victory over the University of Oklahoma highlights how smaller teams with allegedly lower quality recruits can use a new method of attack to level the playing field. In cyberspace operations, what is to stop a small nation state from responding with a non-attributable cyberspace operation in response to perceived threats or incursions by a “bullying” superpower? Even if the smaller state is questioned, it could respond that it is acting in self-defense to what it considered an armed attack with necessary actions to protect it from further harm. Such an asymmetric shift in warfare could result in an increasing number of “cyberspace conflicts” much like the low intensity conflicts of the 1980s. However, the capacity for “cyberspace conflicts” to rapidly escalate in lethality, due to self-defense actions, could be an incentive for nation states to instead look for a model that promotes deterrence.\n SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 77.\n\nadversary.\" The official commentary for Protocol I further adds that the definition “refers simply to the use of armed force to carry out a military operation.” Note that because this definition requires the use of armed force, non-military personnel hacking into the New York Stock Exchange and causing substantial economic harm would not be an attack. Such an application identifies practical limitations with the current definition in Article 49.\nCommon Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions states that the Conventions shall apply during “any other armed conflict,” yet that term is not well defined in the conventions. The official commentary to Common Article 2 helps in understanding what is an armed conflict and states that “de facto hostilities” are sufficient. The commentary then makes clear the Conventions’ intention for a low threshold and broad application of the term “armed conflict”:\nThe substitution of this much more general expression for the word \"war\" was deliberate. One may argue almost endlessly about the legal definition of \"war.\" A\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/470?OpenDocument. The United States has not ratified Protocol I, but it is accepted as customary international law. It is interesting to note that Article 49 further states:\n[The] provisions of this section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.\n*Id.* International law recognizes distinctions with regard to conducting hostilities in the domains of air and sea, yet there is no strong movement for international recognition of the distinctive qualities of the domain of cyberspace.\n Commentary for Protocol I, art. 49, para. 1882, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=470&amp;t=com.\n Even in 1977, international law failed to grasp the importance of economic battles that could bring a country to its knees.\n The four Geneva Conventions were signed on 12 August 1949. Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3114, 75 U.N.T.S. 31; Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3217, 75 U.N.T.S. 85; Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135; Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 75 U.N.T.S. 287. The Conventions and their commentaries are available on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) web page at: http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView. The Geneva Conventions represent customary international law with regard to the conduct of armed hostilities or *jus in bello*.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 73\nState can always pretend, when it commits a hostile act against another State, that it is not making war, but merely engaging in a police action, or acting in legitimate self-defence. The expression \"armed conflict\" makes such arguments less easy. Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, or how much slaughter takes place.\nIn addition to the above statement, each of the four commentaries to the Geneva Conventions provides slightly different amplifying language for Article 2. This is, no doubt, due to the specific context of each of the four Geneva Conventions. For example, with respect to the First Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, the Commentary adds:\nThe respect due to human personality is not measured by the number of victims. Nor, incidentally, does the application of the Convention necessarily involve the intervention of cumbrous machinery. It all depends on circumstances. If there is only a single wounded person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .\n Commentary to Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions. The quoted language is repeated in paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of each of the four Geneva Conventions. Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/365-570005?OpenDocument; Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/370-580005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600005?OpenDocument.\n Id. Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Geneva Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12 1949, provides almost identical language, with a minor distinction regarding shipwrecked persons: “If there is only a single shipwrecked person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .” Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the\n\nThus, what is clear from the Commentaries regarding when an “armed conflict” has occurred is not the number or persons involved or whether the parties are using “cumbrous machinery”, such as tanks, rockets, planes, etc., or “even if there has been no fighting,” but simply whether there is “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces.” Further, a consistent theme is that “armed conflict” usually involves some sort of negative impact on at least one person, even if it is a civilian victim. The Commentary language begs the question—a question not answered—what is “intervention of the armed forces?”\nIn sum, this discussion of the Geneva Conventions as they relate to *jus in bello* reveals that “armed conflict” is an activity that involves acts of violence between armed forces, which affect at least one person, regardless of the amount of damage or suffering inflicted. Overall, the threshold is quite low and certainly does not require significant damage or loss of life. The policy concern to protect people from the harsh effects of conflict most likely inspired such a low, almost bright-line approach. While the definitions and Official Commentaries of the Conventions help explore the issue, the U.N. Charter remains the principal document for analyzing *jus ad bellum* issues relevant to the armed attack determination.\n## D. Armed Attack and Jus ad Bellum\nUnfortunately, the U.N. Charter itself provides very little by way of definition when it comes to the term, “armed attack.” Moreover, no official commentary addresses the issue. However, one place scholars have turned for clarification is the U.N. General Assembly’s 1974 resolution defining aggression, Resolution Number 3314. In that resolution, the General Assembly defined aggression as the “use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or\nConvention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12 1949, provides the following minor distinction:\nIt makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces; it suffices for the armed forces of one Power to have captured adversaries falling within the scope of Article 4. Even if there has been no fighting, the fact that persons covered by the Convention are detained is sufficient for its application. The number of persons captured in such circumstances is, of course, immaterial.\nParagraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War simply clarifies with regard to civilians that the “respect due to the human person as such is not measured by the number of victims.”\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 75\npolitical independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\" More importantly, the resolution provides a number of specific acts that constitute aggression, including, but not limited to:\nInvasion, attack or military occupation; bombardment or the use of any weapons against a State; blockade; an attack on the land, sea, or air forces or the marine and air fleets of a State; and the sending of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries to complete any of the previous acts.\nThe resolution states that it may limit a finding of aggression in light of relevant circumstances, such as when the act is not of \"sufficient gravity.\" The pragmatic tone of this qualifying language is more consistent with how nation states subjectively conclude whether an armed attack occurred. The term \"sufficient gravity\" may be an unintended endorsement of the \"bully dilemma.\" Thus, the \"bully\" state again avoids accountability when the international community determines its small-scale aggression is not of \"sufficient gravity,\" i.e. the international community is not sufficiently concerned about their own safety and security. Unfortunately, subjective conclusions do not add much clarity to resolving what acts would be considered an armed attack in cyberspace. As noted above, such definitional clarity is essential to aiding all states in understanding which acts in cyberspace can result in self-defense actions. If there was a legal framework, which created a clearer understanding of one's accountability in cyberspace, there would be a greater likelihood of deterring states from acting\n G. A. Res. 3314, U.N. GAOR, 29th Sess., art. 1 (Dec. 14, 1974) available at http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/29/ares29.htm. This language is almost identical to the language found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n Id. art. 3.\n Mr. Sharp accurately notes that the United States uses the factors of scope, duration and intensity to determine whether de facto hostilities exist, but notes that the application has been inconsistent. When a Navy A-6 crew was shot down over Syria in 1983 and one of the crew members was captured, the U.S. claimed POW status for Lt Goodman and stated that “‘armed conflict’ includes any situation in which there is hostile action between the armed forces of two parties, regardless of the duration, intensity or scope of the fighting.” (emphasis added by this author) This is contrasted with the later U.S. position regarding the status of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant as an unlawful detainee, since the U.N. operations in Somalia “did not rise to the level of de facto international armed conflict.” SHARP, supra note 4, at 61-62. Essentially, Mr. Sharp’s position is that the U.S. position has evolved and now relies on the conjunctive “and” when applying the three factors of scope, duration, and intensity, versus the disjunctive “or.”\n\naggressively in cyberspace, because they would know which acts could result in a cyberspace self-defense action.\nWhether one looks to the “Schmitt analysis” using six factors or Sharp’s approach of “heuristic analysis” to develop a profile of how states apply the factors of scope, duration, and intensity to the U.N. Charter and Common Article 2 framework, there appears to be no clear answer in contemporary international law. Mr. Sharp, quoting Ian Brownlie, attempted to illustrate how international law can be applied during an international incident: “the minor nature of an attack” helps to prove the “intention to attack, of honest mistake, or simply the limited objectives of an attack.” Brownlie’s observation made sense in the days of conventional weapons and minor border skirmishes or incursions. One or two shots fired by a border guard versus dropping two 1,000 pound bombs can circumstantially help determine intent. Generally, with such kinetic attacks, the first or second order effects are readily discernable. However, warfare has changed and a new domain has evolved.\nIn cyberspace, what may appear as a “minor attack” could evolve into something much more destructive to a nation state, taking days or months to cause observable, significant harm. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks, and cyberspace attacks are quite different from the traditional methods of massing forces and building up logistics trains and lines of communication. States can much more easily identify preparation for a kinetic invasion versus a cyberspace onslaught. Asymmetric warfare may require asymmetric application of the law to provide the clarity and enforceability capable of promoting peace. The development of international law related to activities in cyberspace should not be delayed any longer.\nAnd why is finding a legally clear answer so difficult? In his writing, Sharp recognizes the concerns with a strict interpretation of Common Article 2, since such a “rote” application of the Article 2 threshold “intentionally causes military personnel to become belligerents and lawful targets even though they are conducting a peacetime military operation.” Sharp’s concern regarding a strict\n Recall the conclusion of supra note 17 regarding how the asymmetric nature of cyberspace warfare could result in an increasing number of conflicts, all with the potential of having substantially greater effects than traditional low intensity conflicts. This asymmetric nature has created a potential deterrence vacuum, which the law must attempt to fill and states must then enforce.\n SHARP, supra note 4, at 66 (quoting IAN BROWNLEIE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES, 366 (1954)).\n I refer the reader to the two lead-off quotes at the beginning of this article. The lack of clear, enforceable law will only embolden activities in cyberspace and increase international tension and the likelihood of substantial physical damage in addition to the on-going intellectual carnage.\n SHARP, supra note 4, at 65-66.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 77\napplication of Common Article 2 to *jus ad bellum*, conflict management, is certainly justified with regard to the evolution of conventional military activities, such as peacekeeping and peacemaking.\nCyberspace operations, however, do not create the same concerns related to peacekeeping operations. There has been no move to create a U.N. “cyberspace peacekeeping force” to engage in online actions to enforce U.N. resolutions or sanctions, and cyberspace forces are not conducting humanitarian missions. In addition, neither Common Article 2, the U.N. Charter, nor the U.N. definition of aggression are contemporary enough to be strictly applied to activities in cyberspace, since they lack definitions applicable to the unique methods used in cyberspace operations. Nevertheless, the policy objective and low threshold of Common Article 2 provide hope that international law is capable of applying a stricter, definition-based approach to cyberspace attacks. The need for a legally clear answer should help shift the focus from an ambiguous, effects-based approach that relies solely on international law to the development of a definition-based approach capable of consistent application to cyberspace operations that affect other states.\n## E. Weapons are the Key\nThe U.N. General Assembly’s defined aggression to include the use of “any weapons” against another state. The use of such a clearly broad term as “any” logically implies that the use of even minor weapons against a state could be considered an act of aggression, if the circumstances are of “sufficient gravity.” Leaving aside the inevitably ambiguous discussion of events that may be of “sufficient gravity” in the eyes of the U.N. General Assembly, the General Assembly’s inclusion of the use of weapons in its definition of aggression brings the discussion regarding armed attacks in cyberspace back to the initial proposal of analyzing cyberspace attacks using the criminal law model.\nThe criminal law model’s reliance on clear definitions requires us to focus on the causative event, versus emphasizing the effects. For example, a crime is committed when a person fires a gun toward another, regardless of whether the other person is actually struck by a bullet. The minimum crime is some type of assault, likely an aggravated one, in the absence of a legal defense. If the person is struck by the bullet (effect of attack) or other circumstances are developed to indicate a more serious intent, then the chargeable crimes range from aggravated assault to murder. As this example demonstrates, under a criminal law approach, a crime (attack) occurred under all of the factual variations. The increase in harm (effect) only increases the level of punishment the offender may face from society and does not influence whether a crime of some sort occurred.\n\nRegardless of the severity of the crime (attack), societies have long recognized the policy interest in taking measures to respond to and deter crimes. This deterrence objective is a philosophical difference between a criminal law approach and an effects-based approach relying on international law. International law, relying upon an effects-based threshold, is implicated only when an incident’s consequences rise above a certain threshold. Whereas the criminal law model reacts even if there is just an attempt to commit a prohibited act. Thus, a criminal law approach focuses on the actual act and the method used, whether accessing a computer without proper authorization or robbing a bank with a gun. Relying on the criminal law approach allows one to examine the genesis of an attack at an even deeper level. The criminal law approach strives to provide clarity and consistency, allowing all members of a society to know what conduct is prohibited, which also serves the additional objective of deterrence. In the case of defining cyberspace attacks, a consideration of cyberspace weapons is the key to providing such clarity.\nThe use of a weapon of some kind is the true genesis of an attack. In fact, the types of weapons available to a state determine the possible attack methodologies. Thus, studying weapons is also important to understanding the strategy of potential adversaries. However, for the purpose of providing clarity to the issue of armed attacks in cyberspace, the definition of what is a weapon in cyberspace becomes the foundational question to developing a new approach to international law affecting cyberspace operations.\nWhile the U.N. General Assembly used the term “any weapon” and provided no further definition of what constitutes a weapon, one can turn to the law of armed conflict (LOAC) for assistance. Based on the LOAC’s specific guidance regarding conventional tools of war, conventional militaries tend to have a practical understanding of what are lawful and unlawful weapons. For example, exploding bullets and poisonous gas are unlawful weapons. The LOAC focuses, however, almost completely on kinetic weapons.\nDespite its narrow focus on kinetic weapons, the LOAC has nevertheless struggled to define a “weapon,” and there is currently no\n For example, possessing and being able to field deep strike kinetic weapons such as low observable bombers opens up a range of options for a state actor. Likewise, possessing and being willing to use suicide bombers or biological weapons creates a tactical (asymmetric) advantage over adversaries. Thus, being able to conduct operations in cyberspace creates a new line of attack methods.\n Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Oct. 18, 1907, art. 23, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/195?OpenDocument [hereinafter Hague Regulation (IV)]. Article 23 outlaws weapons that cause unnecessary suffering. See also Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, Geneva, June 17, 1925.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 79\naccepted definition under international law. Instead, Article 36 of Protocol I requires a review of any “new weapon, means or method of warfare” to ensure its use would comply with international law. Although the United States has not ratified Protocol I, customary international law requires the review of weapons.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has noted that each state tends to have its own definition of “weapon.” Even within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) there is no standard definition of “weapon.” Thus, each service developed its own definition of weapon, which it uses to determine whether a means or method of warfare requires a legal review in accordance with Article 36 of Protocol I. In the Air Force, paragraph 1 of Air Force Instruction 51-402, Weapons Review, 13 May 1994, defines weapons as “devices designed to kill, injure, or disable people, or to damage or destroy property.” The definition specifically excludes “electronic warfare devices.” The definition also differentiates between effects on people and effects on property, failing to include devices that “disable” property. Meanwhile, the United States Army and Navy each provide a definition of weapon that specifically includes devices that “disable” property. Thus, the Army and Navy definitions appear to be more\n Throughout the remainder of the discussion, the term “weapon” will be used in lieu of the broader term, “weapon, means or method of warfare.”\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONS LAW DIV., OFFICE OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL, DEP’T OF THE AIR FORCE, AIR FORCE OPERATIONS &amp; THE LAW 25, 48 (1st ed. 2002).

THE KEY TO THIS PUZZLE: CYBERSPACE WEAPONS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW DEFINITION-BASED MODEL\n### A. Defining Cyberspace Weapons\nThe criminal law approach and methodology help resolve the issues of ambiguity, enforceability, and attribution for two reasons. First, it provides strong definitions that can withstand judicial scrutiny and allow for fair application to a variety of fact patterns. A nuance of this first strength is that criminal law definitions must also clearly put everyone on notice as to prohibited activities. The second strength is that the criminal law methodology requires the definition of a prohibited act to have some degree of intent, also known as the scienter element. Relying on these strengths, the criminal law approach creates a definition of a cyberspace crime that is clear, flexible, and requires a minimum level of intent. The criminal law methodology will then enable us to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace crime in order to establish the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nAs noted earlier, the European Union’s Convention on Cybercrime is an international treaty intended to create consistency in criminal laws related to internet activities. Unfortunately, the Cybercrime Convention does not offer a definition of malicious logic or cyberspace weapon. Instead, the Cybercrime Convention identifies specific activities states should criminalize. Logically, the reason to prohibit certain activities is to avoid unwanted effects. The criminal law methodology is able to transform unwanted effects into specific definitions and prohibitions, whereas the current approach under international humanitarian law relies on an ambiguous analysis of facts using undefined prohibitions.\nThe intent of the Cybercrime Convention was to set up a basic framework whereby the parties agreed to create their own state criminal codes to address broadly defined prohibited activities. Because the Convention defines prohibited activities broadly, it does not provide the detailed definitions of actual effects in cyberspace necessary to specifically define a cyberspace weapon. Nevertheless, the Convention’s aspirational criminal law definitions of unlawful activity in cyberspace can help identify the international community’s thoughts\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 81\nregarding unlawful cyberspace effects and thus the weapons that cause those effects. By looking at what types of activities the Cybercrime Convention intends to criminalize, it is possible to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nSpecifically, the Cybercrime Convention provides that the parties will adopt laws that criminalize cyberspace crimes such as: unlawful access, unlawful interception, interfering with data or systems, and computer fraud or forgery. Looking at the broad definitions for these offenses under the Cybercrime Convention, terms such as “obtaining,” “damaging,” “deleting,” “deteriorating,” “altering” or “suppressing” data represent a common theme of what happens to electromagnetic data when a cyberspace crime occurs.\nThis criminal law framework parallels the scenarios discussed by many others with regard to armed attacks in cyberspace. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense defines Computer Network Attack as: “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.” Whether a cyberspace crime or a cyberspace attack, the goal is to affect someone else’s data, or use data to affect property.\nThe domain of cyberspace is obviously not as physically transparent as the domains of air and space. If one were to try and “fire” one million volts at a cyberspace target, there are too many information nodes, such as routers and switches, along the internet pathway that would become the unintended recipient of the “electromagnetic missile.” The one million volt “electromagnetic missile” would cause\n See Convention on Cybercrime, supra note 10, at arts. 2-8.\n Id. arts. 4, 5. Article 4 provides:\nData interference: 1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data without right. 2. A Party may reserve the right to require that the conduct described in paragraph 1 result in serious harm.\nArticle 5 provides:\nSystem interference: Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.\n JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUB. 1-02, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS 113 (17 Mar. 2009) [hereinafter JP 1-02].\n\ncollateral damage to those nodes and would be worn down long before it reached its intended target. Cyberspace attacks, just like criminal hacks, are designed to affect electromagnetic data in various ways, which then impact the adversary's cyberspace to create an operational advantage for the attacker. Thus, the basic legal framework of the Cybercrime Convention is beneficial in the context of military operations in cyberspace.\nAlthough the Cybercrime Convention does not provide definitions of key terms such as \"damaging\" or \"altering,\" the Cybercrime Convention points us to the criminal codes of party states, such as the United States, to specifically define the actus reus. The criminal code of the United States is considered for several reasons: the United States invented the internet; the United States is arguably the largest user of cyberspace; the United States is a leading prosecutor of cyberspace crimes; and many nations work with the United States to solve cyberspace crimes.\nSection 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes intentionally causing damage to a protected computer.[42] Section 1030 is often used by U.S. Attorneys to prosecute persons who steal or corrupt data located on computer systems and persons who engage in denial of service attacks. Section 1030 defines \"damage\" as \"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.\" This definition of \"damage\" recognizes the reality of what happens during a criminal hack or a cyberspace attack: \"damage\" in cyberspace does not require smashing, burning, or blowing things up. The U.S. Code provides a clear, judicially accepted and internationally recognized definition of damage in the cyberspace realm. By borrowing from this definition, it is possible to logically develop a definition of a cyberspace weapon, the key to the puzzle.[43]\nFrom the above, we see that in its most simple terms, the definition of a weapon is \"something that causes damage.\" Applying the definition of damage from Section 1030, I propose the following definition of a cyberspace weapon: Any capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.[44] Although the proposed definition uses the term\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n\n## B. Applying the Definition of a Cyberspace Weapon\nNow that we have defined cyberspace weapon, the remaining challenge is to determine whether the proposed definition works within the context of cyberspace operations and within the current limits of international law. While the first instances of negative code may not have been written with the intent of harming a computer, today the story is quite different. Today, the development of computer code that negatively impacts an information system has evolved and spread like an advanced, persistent plague. The tools of the modern hacker, whether criminal, military, terrorist, geek, or spy, are broadly referred to as malicious logic. While malicious logic can take many forms, the key question for our purposes is: “At what point does malicious logic become a cyberspace weapon, the use of which constitutes an armed attack under international law?” The first part of the question focuses not on the end result but on the “tool” used in cyberspace and whether that tool is a “weapon.” The second part of the question will focus on the weapon’s use in cyberspace.\nFirst, one must consider whether particular cyberspace “tools” constitute weapons under international law. The ICRC Commentary on Article 35 of Additional Protocol I states: “The words ‘methods and means’ include weapons in the widest sense, as well as the way in which they are used.” Furthermore, the ICRC Guide on New Weapons expounds on the above commentary provision by noting that the legal\n Again, recall that while the services’ definitions of weapon all used the term “disable,” JP 1-02, supra note 41, uses the term “degrade” when describing Computer Network Attack.\n Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1402 (for art. 35). Article 35 provides overarching guidance regarding the means and methods of warfare and reads:\nBasic rules - 1. In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. 2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. 3. It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.\nProtocol I, supra note 19, at art. 35.\n\nreview requirements of Article 36 apply even to non-lethal weapons based on “the ways in which these weapons are to be used pursuant to military doctrine, tactics, rules of engagement, operating procedures and countermeasures” and also applies to all acquired weapons, whether procured based on military specifications or “off-the shelf.”47 Both the Commentary and the ICRC guide conclude that the analysis regarding whether a weapon is lawful or unlawful should be focused on the weapon’s “normal or expected use.”48\nNext, one must analyze how the proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon can be applied in the real-world context of two recent “cyberspace attacks” in Estonia and Georgia. Considering the realities of these two events, does the proposed definition provide sufficient clarity for use in international law?\nThe cyberspace event in April and May of 2007 in Estonia involved a number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) actions against the networks for the two largest banks, effectively severing all internet communications for two hours and causing partial interruptions thereafter.49 The event also included acts against an Estonian government internet service provider that “disrupted government communications for at least a short period of time.”50 Lastly, the web page for the Estonian Prime Minister was “defaced,” manipulating it to show an alleged apology for moving a Soviet World War II memorial.51 Clearly, the event in Estonia resulted in reduced availability and impaired the integrity of the information located on computer systems in Estonia. Applying the attacker’s methods to the proposed definition, it is clear these methods constituted “cyberspace weapons.”\nThe cyberspace event that occurred in July and August of 2008 in Georgia results in a similar conclusion. Again, a DDoS event targeted the website of the Georgian President, making it unavailable for 24 hours. Attackers also defaced the website with pictures of Adolf Hitler next to the image of the Georgian President, and, using malicious logic, caused websites for other government agencies to lose connectivity.52 Here again, the methods used by cyberspace attackers in Georgia caused a loss of access and impaired the integrity of the data. Consequently, it is appropriate to label these methods as “cyberspace weapons.” The proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon therefore\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 85\n\nprovides the degree of clarity to move the discussion forward to defining a cyberspace attack.\n## C. When is the Use of a Cyberspace Weapon a Cyberspace Attack?\nAcknowledging that cyberspace weapons were used in the events in Estonia and Georgia does not answer the ultimate question of whether the acts should be considered armed attacks under international law? Here again, the temptation is to return to an effects-based analysis to answer the question. However, as noted at the beginning of this article, previous attempts to answer the question using such an analysis provide ambiguous answers at best. Instead, by applying a definition-based approach, much like the criminal law does, there is a higher likelihood of reaching a clear answer. Therefore, in order to determine when the use of a cyberspace weapon constitutes an “armed attack” under international law, one must look to how the cyberspace weapon is used rather than its effects.\nThis question of how a weapon is used is the key transitional point in this analytical approach and borrows substantially from the criminal law. For example, a gun can either be a weapon used to kill people or a weapon used to assist a hunter in gathering food. The intent of the user remains the primary issue under the criminal law. Using this criminal law approach will enable conversion of the above question into a definition applicable to the international law arena.\nTo prove an offense under the criminal law, almost all crimes require proof of *mens rea*, the idea of a criminal intent or purpose. Specifically, most crimes require proof of either specific or general intent or knowledge. The most difficult *mens rea* to prove is specific intent, whereas knowledge is much more easily inferred from the circumstances. Considering history and the unwillingness of state actors to admit their actual intent, proving the specific or general intent of a state actor is very difficult when relying on circumstantial evidence, and would therefore result in an unenforceable definition beneficial only to academic discussions.\nTherefore, because proof of knowledge is easier to prove than either a specific or general *mens rea*, it will lead to a more enforceable standard and place a higher level of responsibility on states. Even though knowledge is a lower threshold than specific or general intent, it is nevertheless a common and accepted *mens rea* requirement under criminal law. Still, the question remains, knowledge of what? As will be discussed further below, state actors have a responsibility, as sovereigns with power and control, to conduct their affairs with due regard for their international legal obligations when they have knowledge of activities within their legal or physical boundaries. Hence, it is appropriate to consider the following definition of a\n\n\"cyberspace attack\": A cyberspace attack occurs when a state knowingly uses or knowingly acquiesces to an entity under its legal control or within its territory using a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state.\nThe proposed definition of cyberspace attack essentially imposes additional responsibility under international law when a state knowingly allows a person or entity to use a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state. Under the unique circumstances of cyberspace, such a clear definition establishes the increased degree of responsibility necessary to promote international peace and help deter the myriad of adverse activities in cyberspace. Consider the actions of one rogue group if they were to successfully conduct a cyberspace attack against the critical infrastructure of another state. Regardless of the group's motives, whether nationalistic, ideological, or criminal, causing the death of several hundred people and millions of dollars worth of property damage is a scenario that international law must evolve to address and deter. Still, if the state is completely unaware of a rogue element's activities, then it seems appropriate not to impart responsibility and accountability under international law.\nHowever, what if the state that can legally control the rogue element knew that the element was about to or was currently engaging in a cyberspace attack against persons or property in the victim state? The responsible state could, if necessary, disrupt all communications originating from the rogue element or emanating from the state until it could locate and arrest the attackers for violating their domestic laws. The definition of a cyberspace attack, although similar to the definition of a cyberspace crime, is not intended to hold states responsible for the nefarious efforts of criminals, unless the state is aware of the criminal's efforts and knowingly acquiesces to the use of a cyberspace weapon. The objective is to develop a legal framework that inspires states to cooperate to eliminate the harmful use of cyberspace—to create deterrence.\nWithout the proposed legal framework, why should a state try to stop an impending cyberspace attack against another state? Under current state practice, if the victim state is an \"ally,\" then the responsible, \"host\" state will likely feel much more compelled to take positive steps to stop the attack. For example, if a hacker in the United Kingdom was conducting a cyberspace attack against the Hoover Dam in the United States, U.K. security and law enforcement officials would almost certainly act with all diligence to stop the attack and arrest the perpetrators, and would likely allow their extradition to the United States.[53] However, how many cyberspace events against entities in the\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n\nSome argue that international law may not be inclined to place such a clear responsibility on states for acquiescing to uses of cyberspace weapons, unless they caused effects equivalent to more traditional armed attacks. However, the United Nations has issued resolutions that appear to place a higher burden on states to refrain from acquiescing to certain acts committed from their territory against other states. For example, a General Assembly Resolution in 1970, number 2625, discussed acquiescence and said that states have a duty to refrain from acquiescing or tolerating actions from within its territory that cause civil strife in the other state. More recently, the United Nations\nof U.S. military servers in 2001 and 2002.

The key excerpts from the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among states in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations are:\nEvery State has a duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting, or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force . . .\nAlso, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State. . .\nStates have the duty to co-operate with one another, irrespective of the differences in their political, economic and social systems, in the various spheres of international relations, in order to maintain international peace and security . . .\nAll states enjoy sovereign equality. They have equal rights and duties . . .\nThe principles of the Charter which are embodied in this Declaration constitute basic principles of international law . . .\n\nSecurity Council issued Resolution 1373 on September 28, 2001, which reaffirmed the key principles in Resolution 2625. Resolution 1373 decided under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that all states shall take the necessary steps to prevent terrorist acts, to prevent terrorists from using their territories for terrorist purposes, and to provide early warning to other states.\nAlthough not directly on point with all scenarios of cyberspace attack, some cyberspace attacks could fit within the resolutions’ already accepted prohibitions related to harboring terrorists, preventing use of territory by terrorists, and acquiescing to those who cause civil strife. The proposed definition of armed attack in cyberspace would really only increase the degree of state responsibility for non-state actors by a small amount. In light of the growing concern related to the impact of non-state actors on international peace, and considering the asymmetric and potentially dangerous attributes of cyberspace, such an increase in state responsibility is not unreasonable.\nThe strength of the proposed definition of cyberspace attack is that it would place a clear responsibility on all states. All states would know what international law requires and non-state actors would know that their actions could be considered armed attacks. Although clear and strict in comparison to the current approach, the proposed legal threshold is not improperly low. It has a reasonable *mens rea* requirement, to wit: the host state must have knowledge of the impending or ongoing use of a cyberspace weapon. Because the proposed definition requires knowing acquiescence, a state can claim the defense of impossibility. For example, the host state may have no knowledge of an ongoing cyberspace attack because the rogue element first hacked into and gained control of the entire host state’s communications infrastructure. Still, once the host state became aware of the intended location of the attack, it would then be responsible to at least communicate that information to the victim state and continue to take reasonable measures to stop or impede the attack and cooperate with the victim state.\nThe unique attributes of cyberspace, such as its speed and lack of physical borders, are key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory when they do not take reasonable measures to stop the attack and warn the victim state. One cannot overemphasize the potency of the asymmetric capabilities of cyberspace in comparison to any other war-fighting domain in the world’s history, a capability that enables almost any person to engage in actions with\n S.C. Res. 1373, U.N. SCOR, 4385th mtg., U.N. Doc.

Res. 56/1, U.N. GAOR, 56th Sess., U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/1 (Sept. 12, 2001).\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 89\nlethal and costly effects. Therefore, another difference between the proposed definition and current requirements under international law is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack does not include a requirement that the attack involve the armed forces of the aggressor, as the commentary to Common Article 2 requires and the U.N. definition of aggression implies. However, the U.N. definition of aggression clearly includes mercenaries and irregulars. Once more, considering the asymmetric nature of cyberspace, requiring a cyberspace attack to involve the armed forces or mercenaries of the aggressor would create a legal hole big enough for hundreds of thugs and brigands to \"attack\" the victim state. In consideration of the incredible amount of physical or information damage that non-state actors can cause in cyberspace, knowing acquiescence to such attacks is the correct standard for imposing state responsibility under international law.\nBut, is it fair to impose such strict accountability on the use of cyberspace, when some cyberspace attributes, such as ease of access and use, are similar to those of global commons? For example, some may argue that the proposed definition is contrary to Article 8 of the Hague Regulation (V).[57] Article 8 provides that “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” It is accepted that many cyberspace communications occur over “telephone cables” and similar telecommunications infrastructure. Thus, the language of Article 8 is applicable to cyberspace operations. Article 8 clearly does not place a duty on a neutral power to forbid or restrict belligerents from using their communications infrastructure. In fact, Article 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) states that any restrictive measures implemented by a neutral power must be equally applied to “both belligerents.” Article 8’s language, therefore, appears to contradict the proposed definition.\nAlternatively, one could argue that the proposed definition of cyberspace attack does not conflict with Article 8, because the proposed definition creates a transitional status for a state. Once a state becomes aware of a cyberspace attack originating from its territory and targeting another state, it is no longer a \"neutral power\" and now must act to stop the attack or become a de facto \"belligerent.\" The idea of a state transitioning between being a neutral power and a belligerent may be too tenuous for realistic application in international law. In the alternative, states could choose, when adopting the proposed definition\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nof cyberspace attack, to explicitly state that Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) no longer apply to cyberspace.\nGoing back to the Estonia and Georgia events, most media attributed the use of cyberspace weapons to Russian internet addresses. Despite early and widespread media attribution to Russia, the attacks continued, strongly implying that Russia was directly responsible for the attacks. Apparently, Russian law enforcement and security services made no effort to stop the cyberspace attacks. Russia was certainly on notice that the world community believed the cyberspace attacks were originating from within its borders. While circumstantial evidence clearly indicated that Russia knowingly acquiesced to these attacks, there was no direct evidence. Reviewing the circumstantial evidence under the proposed definition indicates that Russia violated international law and the victim states had the right of self-defense. However, relying on circumstantial evidence is not something the international community and international law are generally comfortable doing.\nThis lack of direct evidence is indicative of the attribution problem currently hindering all investigations of actions in cyberspace. Investigators of domestic cyberspace crimes meticulously use forensic tools to identify which specific internet protocol (IP) address is responsible for a cyberspace crime and then interview the suspect to determine their level of knowledge or intent. Unfortunately, overseas investigations can only be accomplished if there is cooperation between the involved states. When a foreign state does not provide equal access to forensic evidence and suspects, the attribution barrier obstructs the inquiry and protects the “attacker.” Such actions do not promote peace or resolve conflict.\nThe effects-based model would likely conclude that the Estonia and Georgia attacks were not severe enough to be considered armed attacks or even an unlawful use of force. There were no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack. The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy. Reviewing the international reaction after the fact, there were no declarations by the international\n Arthur Bright, *Estonia accuses Russia of ‘cyberattack,’* CHRISTIAN SCI.

Charter or that they created de facto hostilities under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions. Estonia chose not to consider them armed attacks, while the Georgia situation simultaneously devolved into a kinetic conflict. What option did Estonia really have? If Estonia felt it had sufficient attribution, Estonia could have considered the acts armed attacks, creating a de facto state of hostilities and requested the assistance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under the NATO Treaty’s collective self-defense provision. Estonia could have waited for NATO to risk war with Russia. Estonia could also have responded in self-defense with conventional, kinetic forces, since they did not have any “cyberspace forces.” The potential result could have been a strong conventional response from Russia, including occupation of Estonia. Again, the “bully dilemma” reared its head. This prompts the question, is it fair to rely on a 60 year-old conventional model that gives such weight to state practice when the kinetic forces and available cyberspace capabilities are so disproportionate?\nIndeed, continued reliance on such a model could lead “minor” states to develop cyberspace forces in an effort to achieve an asymmetric advantage over states with much larger kinetic capabilities, leading to a cyberspace arms race and possibly more conflicts. As the Estonia and Georgia events demonstrate, when a state knowingly chooses to not assist a victim state or hold responsible those who use cyberspace weapons against other states, international law should view that state as a transgressor.\nThat is what the proposed definition of cyberspace attack intends to do. The proposed definition will have a positive impact on international law and conflict management, because it will clearly place\n North Atlantic Treaty art. 5, Apr. 4, 1949, 63 Stat. 2241, 34 U.N.T.S. 243. Article 5 states:\nThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.\n\nresponsibility on all states to not engage in cyberspace attacks and to police and secure their cyberspace “borders.” Essentially, everyone will know a cyberspace attack when they see it, and everyone will know that any state that conducts or permits such an attack could suffer self-defense actions and international sanctions. The end result would hopefully be a dramatic decrease in cyberspace events of foreign origin, which would also reduce the likelihood of a cyberspace “arms race” and cause the de-escalation of low intensity conflicts in cyberspace.\n## D. Flies in the Ointment: Attribution and Espionage\nAs referenced above, an effects-based approach magnifies the attribution problem, because it requires attribution of intentional direct participation or support by the state actor, versus knowing acquiescence. The difficulty of attribution in cyberspace prevents the evolution of realistic customary norms. No state actor can realistically consider the full spectrum of actions, because they do not know who acted against them or why. In addition, the difficulty in comprehending the full severity of the “attack,” because of the delayed effects of cyberspace weapons, compounds the difficulty in determining an appropriate response.\nUnlike the effects-based approach, the proposed definition does not require determining who controlled or supported the activity, the aggressor’s intent, or the full magnitude of the attack. Using the\n The concept of boundaries and sovereignty in cyberspace is also a topic of discussion amongst academics and practitioners. Although there is no clear definition and enforcement of boundaries in cyberspace, all states should recognize that electronic communications of all types originate in one state and can terminate (and have effects) in another state. Therefore, a state can monitor communications occurring inside its geographic borders. For example, the NSA under the Terrorist Surveillance Program was able to monitor communications where one party was located “outside” the United States. White House Press Briefing, Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales &amp; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, Principal Deputy Dir. of Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2005/intell-051219-dni01.htm. The concept of cyberspace borders has even been expanded to include discussions of a cyberspace Monroe Doctrine with regard to cyberspace infrastructure associated to the United States. See Reviewing the Federal Cybersecurity Mission: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Homeland Sec., Sub-Comm. on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, &amp; Sci. &amp; Tech., 110th Cong. (2009) (statement of Mary Ann Davidson, Oracle Security Officer), available at http://homeland.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20090310143850-78976.pdf.\n Relying on a heuristic analysis of past actions is somewhat similar to how scientists conduct scientific experiments and then analyze the results. In order for scientific experiments and their results to be reliable, external factors must be eliminated or controlled, and all other factors must be accurately known. The lack of attribution makes it impossible to accurately complete a heuristic analysis, since three of the most important factors, identity, intent, and full severity of attack, will rarely be known without it.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 93\ndefinitional approach, only two questions need to be resolved. First, was a cyberspace weapon used against the property or persons of a state? Second, did a foreign state knowingly allow an entity under its legal control to use the cyberspace weapon against the victim?\nEven with the proposed definitions and a two element test, one of the oldest arts, espionage, can still take advantage of the attribution difficulties in cyberspace. Espionage has long been recognized as essential to the success of states and their militaries. While a criminal offense in virtually every nation state, espionage is not a violation of the law of war and was first recognized in the Lieber Code in 1863. It was subsequently codified in the 1907 Hague Regulations and in Protocol I. Acts deemed to be espionage will not trigger a state’s right to self-defense, because espionage does not violate international law. Based on the definitions from the various documents considered part of customary international law, the consistent requirement for espionage is that a member of the armed forces gathers or attempts to gather information under false pretenses or while not wearing their uniform.\nSuch a definition does not perfectly transfer over to espionage in cyberspace. Whether the person at the other computer terminal is wearing his uniform is irrelevant to attributing his identity and intent in cyberspace. Still, a cyberspace spy will intrinsically gain access to the information or data under false pretenses. The average cyberspace intruder does not disclose his identity nor does he come to the main web page and ask the webmaster for permission. Instead, he exploits vulnerabilities in software coding that allow him to gain unauthorized access, which is essentially under false pretenses as discussed in Article\n Sun Tzu stated: “So, as for enlightened lords or distinguished commanders, the reason they can overcome the adversary when action is taken and achieve unparalleled success is prescience. Prescience cannot be gained from ghost or gods . . . . It must be gained from what is learned by men.” SUN TZU, SUN TZU: THE NEW TRANSLATION 112 (J. H. Huang trans. 1993).\n FRANCIS LIEBER, INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIELD, ART. 88 (Apr. 24, 1863), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/110?OpenDocument [hereinafter LIEBER CODE]. Article 88 defines a spy as: “a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy.”\n Article 29 of Hague Regulation (IV), supra note 33, defines a spy thus:\n[A]cting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information, are not considered spies.\nArticle 46 of Protocol I, supra note 19, provides that a member of the armed forces shall not be considered a spy “unless he does so through an act of false pretences or deliberately in a clandestine manner.”\n\nIt is certainly possible for cyberspace spies to gain access to information and copy or degrade the data without the use of a cyberspace weapon. However, the tension between lawful espionage and armed attack in cyberspace occurs when a spy uses a cyberspace weapon to access or steal information. If a traditional spy uses a weapon, such as a pistol, the act is viewed as a criminal act, versus an armed attack. Should the same be true of a cyberspace spy who hacks into a system by using a cyberspace weapon? Applying the proposed definition of cyberspace attack, the use of a cyberspace weapon while committing espionage in or through cyberspace could be interpreted as a cyberspace attack and result in self-defense actions.\nThe only way to resolve the tension between cyberspace espionage and cyberspace attack is to determine whether the cyberspace intruder intends solely to copy and then steal the data or information. Again, this dilemma adds a layer of complexity to the attribution issue by now requiring a determination of the actor’s full intent, creating an untenable situation for the victim state. Given that actions happen so fast in cyberspace, a spy or attacker could move “in and out” before a victim state could do any more than determine the foreign internet protocol (IP) address of the intruder. A full damage assessment, identifying what happened to the victim computer system could take hours to weeks. While some cyberspace attacks may be obvious, many will not be, as the beauty of cyberspace warfare is the ability to create second and third order effects, which are difficult to identify in advance.\nThe attribution issue reaches a pinnacle of complexity when trying to resolve events between espionage and cyberspace attacks. Therefore, today, a victim state is left with three choices: (1) continue to operate in the current international system of subjective analysis and inconsistent past responses while ineffectively trying to gather very detailed attribution information; (2) develop a robust cyberspace force capable of conducting cyberspace attacks, cyberspace espionage, and able to “hack back” to develop reasonably detailed attribution information; (3) or issue an ultimatum to the international community, hoping that others will agree, which informs all other states that any activity in that state’s territory that is determined to satisfy the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack will justify self-defense actions by the victim state.\n Phishing or spear phishing emails target known users on a network and always provide a false reason for the recipient to provide key information or click on a hyperlink that will then redirect the user to another web page where malicious code, read weapon, will be surreptitiously installed on the user’s computer.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 95\nThe difficulty with resolving the espionage issue is that under the first option a state remains vulnerable to many forms of cyberspace attack while attempting to resolve whether the event is an act of espionage or cyberspace attack and waiting for the international community to subjectively analyze the evidence. In addition, the evidence to satisfy the international community would likely include the elusive proof of actual intent to harm the victim state. Adversarial states could choose to take advantage of this slow analysis and decision loop, achieving paralysis by analysis, and methodically weaken a state with what appears to be cyberspace espionage but is in fact a number of cyberspace attacks aimed at creating third order effects. Lastly, it appears that states are not willingly sharing the details of their cyberspace activities with others, which still leaves a void of necessary information to conduct the required heuristic analysis to develop the law under the current framework.\nThe second option will help the state protect itself from adversarial activities in cyberspace and possibly lead to attributable information. In spite of this benefit, the potential of a cyberspace arms race increases. This development could lead to an increase in low scale cyberspace conflicts and ultimately result in an adversary conducting a second or third order cyberspace attack inflicting massive casualties or property damage.67 The continued development of cyberspace capabilities appears to be the current direction of the leading states, such as China, Russia, and the United States. States certainly cannot be faulted for taking such an approach, as the current international legal scheme offers them very little protection yet many opportunities to exploit the cyberspace of other states. Therefore, the race for dominance in cyberspace has begun and may soon grow out of control.\nThe second option also has some parallels to the approach that states took when nuclear tensions were high during the Cold War. The superpowers recognized that conventional methodologies could not be applied to the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). States recognized that Article 51’s right of self-defense limited them to proportional actions. However, due to the overwhelming effect and fairly rapid speed of any nuclear attack, states were doctrinally prepared to respond in full at the first indication of even a limited attack, since they recognized that they could not afford to wait and see how many warheads or which locations the adversary’s warheads hit and how much damage they caused. Superpowers projected that they were capable, prepared, and willing to respond to even a limited, targeted nuclear first-strike with a full-scale response.\n\nHistorically, one can see how nation states adopted their practice in light of the dramatic increase in speed and lethality of nuclear attacks using ICBM’s compared to the previous conventional method of warfare, circa World War II. While many decried the age of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and called it “mad,” one cannot dispute that during that time period, even though there was a nuclear arms race, no nuclear weapons were used. Mad or not, MAD was an effective method of deterrence. There are a number of parallels between the use of ICBMs and cyberspace operations: cyberspace attacks have the potential for incredible lethality; much greater speed than previous weapons; and the actual severity of the threat, the intent, and the identity of the actor are usually too difficult to determine in sufficient time to respond appropriately before the damage is done.\nHowever, there is one crucial difference between today’s option two situation (developing a robust cyberspace force and “hacking back”) and the deterrence model of MAD during the Cold War. Currently, it does not appear that a substantial number of states are willing to make a declaration of mutually assured destruction through cyberspace and simultaneously abstain from conducting cyberspace operations. Without such declarations and cessation of the use of cyberspace weapons, the parallels with the Cold War nuclear deterrence model end. Pragmatically, states do not feel the impetus to consider such an approach. There has been no mass disaster or 9-11 type “wake-up call” in cyberspace, and, as noted above, a number of states likely believe they can “win” in cyberspace. Therefore, applying the nuclear deterrence model to cyberspace operations is not practical. Unfortunately, history has shown that society rarely chooses to collectively legislate against harm until after it suffers the consequences.\nStill, there is one historical example where society chose to proactively legislate and limit the weaponization of a domain, much like option three. The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space. The third option can perhaps draw strength from the efforts to limit the militarization of space, recognizing cyberspace as a sort of international commons similar to outer space. Each state, relying on the proposed definitions, would still retain its sovereignty and control of cyberspace infrastructure located within its borders. The implementation of the proposed definitions would recognize that the use of cyberspace is intended for peace-promoting purposes and the use of weapons in cyberspace, even for espionage purposes, will not be accepted. Providing states the right of self-defense using the lower, clear threshold of the proposed\n Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Jan. 27, 1967, 6 I.L.M. 386, available at http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 97\ndefinitions will hopefully inspire states to abstain from cyberspace espionage and attacks and cooperate to protect the peaceful use of cyberspace.\n## IV. APPLYING THE DEFINITIONS AND EXERCISING SELF-DEFENSE IN CYBERSPACE\nIn order to further understand how option three’s (issuing an ultimatum that the state could respond in self-defense to cyberspace attacks) use of the proposed definitions will promote peace and reduce the improper use of cyberspace, it is helpful to explore how states could act in response to a cyberspace attack. The doctrine of self-defense relies on two principles: necessity and proportionality. Necessity involves whether effective peaceful means of resolution exist; the nature of the aggression, each party’s objectives, and the likelihood of effective intervention by the international community. Proportionality requires limiting the magnitude, scope, and duration of the force used in response to that which is reasonably necessary to counter the threat or attack. The timing of a self-defense action is closely related to the factor of necessity and is a debated issue. A delayed response weakens a state’s claim of necessity to defend itself. While an early response in anticipation of attack also draws questions as to the certainty of need for the self-defense action.\nLooking at necessity and the timing of self-defense actions in cyberspace, the unique qualities of cyberspace again highlight the importance of moving toward a deterrence model. Once a state suffers what it believes to be an armed attack in or through cyberspace, it can arguably satisfy the above requirements of necessity to defend itself. Unfortunately, in cyberspace, there will likely not be sufficient time to consider peaceful resolution of the matter, fully understand the nature of the attack or the intended results, or to mobilize international peacekeeping forces. Thus, the more difficult question related to necessity is how appropriate is anticipatory self-defense in cyberspace?\nAnticipatory self-defense “justifies use of force in anticipation of an ‘imminent’ armed attack.” Basically, a state need not wait to receive the aggressor’s attack and can instead act in self-defense to “repel” the attack. The doctrine “finds it roots in the 1837 Caroline case and subsequent correspondence between then-U.S. Secretary of\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK 4 (2007) [hereinafter U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK]; see also YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION AND SELF-DEFENCE (4th ed. 2005).\n U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 69.\n Id. at 6.\n Id.\n\nState Daniel Webster and his British Foreign Office counterpart Lord Ashburton.\"73 Secretary Webster informed Lord Ashburton that a state can act in self-defense when the circumstances are \"instantaneous, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation.\"74 The attributes of cyberspace, especially speed and lethality, seem quite similar to Secretary Webster's factors. Essentially, if a state is fortunate enough to develop information about a developing or planned cyberspace attack against it, the attributes of cyberspace may compel a state to act in its best interest and exercise anticipatory self-defense.\nThe follow-on question involves what a state can do in self-defense, i.e. how is the principle of proportional response applied in and through cyberspace? In cyberspace, there may be a number of ways to technically counter an attack. A state could disconnect itself from cyberspace. However, such a response seems disproportionately burdensome on the victim state and could cause other forms of harm internally. The victim state could quickly counter with anti-virus measures, although such efforts are always a game of \"catch-up.\" The victim state could respond by disconnecting all cyberspace connections with the aggressor state. However, this will only work as long as the aggressor state chooses not to attack through another state. Moreover, such actions require attribution.\nBecause a state needs to know against which state to exercise self-defense, developing reliable attribution represents another difficulty with applying age-old laws and methods to cyberspace. Given that a cyberspace attack comes from another country and could involve communications \"hopping\" through several other countries, it is nearly impossible for a state to develop attribution without first violating the cyberspace infrastructure and jurisdiction of other states. Currently, to avoid violating another state's cyberspace, states send requests for assistance to cooperating states. The victim state requests help in developing information about the IP address in question and also requests monitoring of that IP address, allowing the state to \"hop back\" to the next IP address, and then request more help. This \"hopping back\" process can be painful and long, leaving the victim state vulnerable. However, the traditional police doctrine of hot pursuit is expanding in international law. Under customary international law, ships and planes can follow offending vessels in hot pursuit up to another state's territorial sea or airspace.75 However, the European Union has adopted the Schengen Agreement that permits law enforcement officials to cross state borders when pursuing a criminal suspected of certain serious\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 99\n\noffenses The agreement provides that the pursuing officers will cease their pursuit upon request of the other state, however, the pursuing officers can request that the other state arrest the suspect.\nExtending the principles of the Schengen Agreement to the domain of cyberspace seems logical, because attacks in cyberspace are analogous to serious criminal offenses. Permitting hot pursuit is consistent with the proposed definition’s efforts to deter states from knowingly acquiescing to cyberspace attacks. Witting host states will find it much harder to hide in the shadow of attribution. Providing victim states with a legal “hot pursuit” capability, including proper coordination mechanisms, will be invaluable to promoting cooperation, reducing crime, and deterring attacks in and through cyberspace.\nWith the ability to more quickly attribute attacks, a state would then have other options to consider under the principle of proportionate response. The victim state could consider firing back in self-defense with a cyberspace weapon at the actual computer(s) used to attack it. This can be reasonably effective if a limited number of computers are involved. However, a victim state will likely remain concerned, due to its limited ability to determine whether more attacks or attacks of increasing severity will follow the initial round of attacks. This challenge may lead a state to consider more serious measures, such as responding with a self-defense attack that involves disrupting a substantial portion of the witting host state’s cyberspace. However, the collateral damage from such a self-defense action could be substantial. The questions of necessity and anticipatory self-defense also affect the proportionality decision. Moreover, nothing prohibits states from defending against a cyberspace attack by using kinetic weapons, such as striking a key communication node with a cruise missile or damaging a state’s communication satellite(s). The hypotheticals and the potential for conflict abound. Thus, the unique nature of cyberspace and the inability to clearly apply current international laws, norms, and practices make resolution of conflict extremely difficult, and should inspire states to seek a framework of cooperation and deterrence, such as the one I advocate in this article.\n\n# V. LOOKING FORWARD AND CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\nThe definitions proposed in this article provide a framework for consistency and an opportunity to level the playing field of international law. Today, states can either choose to continue with the status quo, or, recognizing the benefits of the peaceful use of cyberspace, embrace the need for clear definitions of cyberspace weapon and cyberspace attack. Embracing the definitions I propose would, at most, have a moderate impact on how international affairs are conducted today. The Schengen Agreement and the E.U. Convention on Cybercrime serve as models to build a framework of cooperation to promote peace and reduce crime. States would need to establish cyberspace communications centers, whereby each state would agree to pass information to another state as soon as it became aware of a cyberspace attack against a victim state, but is currently unable to halt the attack from affecting the victim state. The centers would also coordinate the hot pursuit issues related to developing attribution.\nThose states that choose not to adopt the proposed legal definitions and methods of cooperation would do so knowing that their actions or inaction could be viewed as a cyberspace attack. Each state would still continue to exercise its right of self-defense. Meanwhile, the international community could apply the new legal standard when considering whether to apply sanctions. The end result is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack with cooperative application under international law could make a powerful form of asymmetric warfare untenable before it develops into an arms race that leads to increased conflicts and harms people and property.\nWhen our predecessors developed the law of conflict management it is doubtful anyone could foresee the day when a state could attack another state simply by manipulating electronic data. Even the futuristic Buck Rogers and lasers still had visible, kinetic-like effects. Today, one must recognize that the lack of specific definitions for “weapon” and “armed attack” create an untenable vacuum in the evolving domain of cyberspace. So far, only the criminal law has provided thorough definitions in an attempt to keep pace with the development of nefarious tools in cyberspace. The criminal law methodology provides a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt such definitions to the various uses of prohibited cyberspace tools. The field of international law requires similar flexibility. This article attempted to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon from the criminal law’s efforts to specifically define the acts caused by cyberspace criminals. The\n A state could of course provide the information to the potential victim state, even if they were able to halt the attack before it caused harm. This extra level of cooperation would assist all states in developing their capabilities to detect potential cyberspace attacks.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 101\ncriminal law methodology facilitated the development of a definition of a cyberspace attack. By applying the current international law framework to the proposed definition of an armed attack in cyberspace, this article highlighted how such a definition could lead to parity in cyberspace and thereby promote peace through deterrence.",

INTRODUCTION\nChange has come and gone. While academics have been discussing methods to define the use of force in cyberspace, governments and policy makers may have missed an opportunity to shape the law of war. Just like a child “pinching” a peppermint from the candy store while the owner was not looking, someone may have successfully launched two cyberspace attacks, and no one called either one an unlawful use of force or armed attack. Did a state actor set a precedent that could become part of customary international law?\nEvery day there are new stories and developments about the increasing connectivity of people around the world spurred by the continued fast pace of technological developments in the computer and communications industries. Military applications of cyberspace are also rapidly evolving, moving the domain of cyberspace to the front lines of conflicts. But, the legal frameworks that regulate war or armed conflict are lagging far behind the technological changes that have already occurred. Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light. Unfortunately, law, especially international law, failed to keep pace with the new applications of existing technologies. On the criminal front, law enforcement agencies are swamped with allegations ranging from identity theft to theft of corporate data, while armed with only a marginally effective process to investigate, extradite, and prosecute international cyberspace criminals. However, the conduct of military operations in and through cyberspace, with potentially greater global implications, is bypassing the currently inadequate mire of international law. What if international law could provide a framework capable of enabling deterrence in cyberspace?\n U.S.-CHINA ECON. &amp; SEC.

Meanwhile, commercial internet service providers began offering services in the late 1980’s. Today, according to Wikipedia, there are more than 1 billion personal computers in use and more than 1 billion users of the internet. Wikipedia, Personal Computer, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer (last visited Mar. 15, 2009).\n\nScholars have written many articles regarding cyberspace attacks in the international regime and what constitutes a use of force or act of war in cyberspace. Yet, there is no consensus regarding how to define attacks in cyberspace under international law. The unique qualities of operations in cyberspace will make this the most difficult domain in which to resolve international disputes and conflict. In this article, I intend to offer a new methodology for determining armed attacks in cyberspace by using existing criminal law legal tools. Specifically, this methodology will borrow from the criminal law’s definitions of cyberspace crimes, in order to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon. More importantly, by defining cyberspace weapon, this methodology will enable the international community to define what constitutes a cyberspace attack. Providing the legal framework for a definition of cyberspace attack, such as the new methodology outlined in this article, will serve to reduce the potential for conflict in cyberspace.\nThe article will first examine cyberspace and how current approaches have attempted to apply international law to armed attacks in cyberspace. Looking through the lens of current international laws will highlight how the unique attributes of cyberspace could increase the likelihood of international conflict. The article will identify how the failure of international law to define armed attacks and weapons further exacerbates this problem. The article will then transition from current international laws to examine whether current criminal law definitions and methodologies can fill the gap and provide realistic definitions of weapons and armed attacks in cyberspace. Lastly, the article will put these proposed definitions to the test against the most challenging aspects of cyberspace: attribution and espionage.\n See, e.g., Michael N. Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework*, 37 COLUM. J.

APPLYING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBERSPACE ATTACKS: FALLING SHORT WITHOUT DEFINITIONS\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nFor the purposes of this article, I define cyberspace as *an evolving man-made domain for the organization and transfer of data using various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The domain is a combination of private and public property governed by technical rule sets designed primarily to facilitate the flow of information.* The key feature of cyberspace is that it is a man-made domain designed to transfer data and information.\nInformation is the reason cyberspace exists, and this feature makes current discussions involving the international law of conflict management, *jus ad bellum*, so different from traditional *jus ad bellum* discussions. Simply put, information is fundamentally different than the traditional tools of war; bits and bytes bear no physical resemblance to bullets and bombs. Michael Schmitt noted that cyberspace threats differ in four ways from traditional threats: (1) computer networks are a new target category, with computer network attacks capable of providing the same results as striking the traditional target with a kinetic weapon; (2) an attack does not have to use kinetic force and can solely involve a command from one computer to the target system; (3) the intended results are often not kinetic and could simply involve the manipulation of data or disruption of a service; and (4) cyberspace threats are not constrained by political boundaries or geography.\nI would add four more distinguishing factors between cyberspace threats and traditional or kinetic uses of force: (1) cyberspace attacks can be completed literally at the speed of light; (2) the results of some cyberspace attacks, whether intended or not, can be similar to those involving weapons of mass destruction; (3) the cost of acquiring the equipment and expertise to conduct operations in\n---\n This definition was developed jointly with my cyberspace law cohort, Major Noah Bledstein at 8 AF/JA. Major Bledstein has been working on cyberspace law issues since 2003. His assistance in discussing and developing the ideas and definitions in this paper was invaluable. It does not specifically address the issue of whether some part or all of cyberspace should be considered a global commons.\n Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, supra note 4, at 888.\n Because the infrastructure of modern societies relies on the technology and data which can be easily targeted during a cyberspace operation, the disabling of such infrastructure or manipulation of data could cause substantial damage and harm to a society. For example: disabling air traffic control systems or the systems which control the water flowing from a large dam, manipulating the data relied upon by banks or the International Monetary Fund, or manipulating the DNA coding for the subsequent year’s flu vaccine.\ncyberspace is *de minimis* in comparison to fielding conventional forces; and (4) attributing the attack to the responsible party and determining whether the attack was intentional or accidental is extremely difficult.\nThe attribution problem, which this article discusses throughout, is indeed the elusive factor that most severely complicates the application of international law. In fact, the attribution problem makes cyberspace so different from other mediums or domains that it requires an entirely new international law approach. The unique nature of the cyber domain impacts not only national level decisions but also the development of law in this area, as evidenced by the current state of law regarding cyberspace and conflict management, which is discussed below.\n## B. Current Legal Approaches to Cyberspace Attacks\nThe majority of scholars considering attacks in cyberspace have used an ambiguous, effects-based analytical approach relying on international law to determine what constitutes a “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter or whether an “armed attack” occurred under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. The discussions and articles have also looked to other treaties that comprise international law and the law of war, such as the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions. On first impression, an effects-based approach to the issue that relies on\n A nuance of limited attribution is that much of the public is unaware of what is going on in cyberspace. In the other domains where military operations are conducted, the activities are much more visible. However, in cyberspace, we can’t easily spot electrons and data packets whisking by us or through a phone line.\n *See supra* note 4. A brief description of two of the leading approaches follows: First, Gary Sharp’s approach recognizes that a use of force in cyberspace may rise to the threshold of an armed attack, depending on its “scope, duration, and intensity,” which are factors previously relied upon by the United States (*See infra* note 28). Mr. Sharp suggests relying upon an analysis of how states have responded in previous cases to help analyze whether an unlawful use of force or armed attack have occurred, essentially relying on a normative analysis. Mr. Sharp summarizes his test by stating: “What constitutes a use of force of a scope, duration, and intensity that constitutes an armed attack and triggers the law of armed conflict is a question of fact that must be subjectively analyzed in each and every case in the context of all relevant law and circumstances.” SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 69. Michael Schmitt’s analytical approach involves six factors which are used to “délimit” economic/political coercion from determining what is a use of armed force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Mr. Schmitt’s premise for using an effects based approach primarily rests with his assessment that the U.N. Charter was not directly focused on outlawing “force” but rather the “deleterious consequences” of state actions, and outlawing uses of force under Article 2 was a “prescriptive short-hand to achieve their goals.” Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, *supra* note 4, at 911. I would recommend that all practitioners in this area read both works. Mr. Sharp’s book is especially invaluable as a thorough review of international law that applies to cyberspace operations.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 69\ninternational law seems to make sense, since it is electromagnetic data that moves through cyberspace and then creates an electromagnetic effect at the terminating point. The actors certainly focus on what effects they can achieve in and through cyberspace. These effects-based approaches add considerable value to the discussion of the issue, but they are unnecessarily constrained by relying primarily on legal documents and customary international norms developed before the advent of mass-produced computers.\nThe only substantial international legal document developed to address issues related to cyberspace is the European Union's Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention). While the Cybercrime Convention does not address cyberspace attacks as possible acts of war and instead focuses on criminal acts, it does help establish a framework for a new methodology of analyzing cyberspace attacks. Instead of focusing on the end result of a cyberspace event, the effects, and trying to determine whether such an act is a use of force or armed attack under international law, a criminal law methodology places increased emphasis on the genesis of a cyberspace event. The criminal law approach thus focuses on defining the beginning of a cyberspace event and not the effects, and those definitions can then be applied to international law and military operations in cyberspace.\nBefore discussing the benefits of the criminal law approach, however, one must first understand how most commentators are currently applying international law to actions in cyberspace. A review of current scholarship on this issue will show the difficulty in applying decades old terms and norms to actions in cyberspace. As a starting point, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nHowever, without international sanctions there is little incentive for a party to comply with Article 2(4)’s peaceful objectives. The\n Convention on Cybercrime, Nov. 23, 2001, 2296 U.N.T.S. 167, available at http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm.\n U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4\n Id. Art. 1 of the Charter states the purpose of the Charter. Subparagraph 1 specifically states:\nTo maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.\n\nhistorical reality is that most state actors have not conducted themselves as though they feared some form of international punishment for their actions. By itself, Article 2(4) seems, therefore, to create very little deterrent effect in conflict management.\nHowever, in contrast to Article 2(4), Article 51 permits parties to act in self-defense in response to an “armed attack.” Pragmatically, this right of self-defense can have the quickest success at reducing illegal uses of force constituting breaches of the peace, thereby increasing the deterrent effect of international law. While it is important to analyze whether a state action is a threat or use of force, the more critical question is whether the action is an armed attack, authorizing the recipient to respond in self-defense? The right of self-defense puts other states on notice that their offensive actions could be met with military force.\nThe right of self-defense has historically been limited by the reality that smaller nation states would respond against bigger and more powerful states with conventional force only if an attack truly jeopardized its national survival. This could be called the “bully dilemma” of international law. The “bully dilemma” pragmatically disenfranchises smaller and weaker states from the protection of Article 51. If a “bully” state engages in a small-scale breach of the peace against a significantly smaller state that smaller state will likely\n Mr. Sharp reasons “a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), however, the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.” Mr. Sharp recognizes that his position may not be held by all and that any right of self-defense is limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity. SHARP, supra note 4, at 48-49.\n When there is a threat or use of force under Article 2, the United Nations can impose sanctions, to include armed intervention under Chapter 7. However, building the consensus for such actions often takes considerable time and debate, while the victims of such use of force wait for relief. Even the liberation of Kuwait took more than six months before U.N. authorized forces began significant operations to remove Iraqi forces.\n For example, when the United States launched cruise missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan in August 1998, neither country responded with conventional force. The codename for the operation was “Infinite Reach.” What if Sudan had then possessed a capability to respond in cyberspace? How could Sudan respond in cyberspace, and would the U.S. have countered, if attribution could be obtained?\n Mr. Sharp, on page 52 of CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE, supra note 4, concluded the third chapter of his book by stating “[t]here is no black and white, mechanical rule in the law of conflict management that clearly defines what a use of force is under all circumstances.” He then followed that statement by using the opposite of the “bully dilemma” to demonstrate his conclusion that a use of force is a question of fact which must be subjectively analyzed: “For example, a state’s activity that is lawful against another state of equal size may nevertheless be significant enough against a smaller state to cross Article 2(4)’s ‘political independence’ threshold.” A subjective “size matters” approach to law provides no clarity and leaves smaller states wondering whether they can seek international assistance or defend themselves.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 71\nacquiesce to the aggression. The smaller state will likely determine that it is better to suffer outright defeat than to attempt to stop the aggression and fail. Meanwhile, as noted above, sanctions under the U.N. Charter are rarely invoked against the “bully” state, especially when the “bully” state is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and therefore holds a veto.\nHowever, in contrast to the historical “bully dilemma,” as depicted above, the asymmetric nature of operations in cyberspace now allows any party to possess the capability to swiftly act in self-defense with incredible lethality. The “bully” could soon be extinct and a new era of conflict could unfold, where the appearance of parity could inspire more breaches of the peace. This is why the development of law in this area must move forward.\n## C. Looking to Jus in Bello to Define Armed Attack\nThe potential lethality of cyberspace responses and unique attributes of cyberspace should compel international lawyers to consider the right of self-defense against cyberspace attacks in light of both the *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum*. Beginning with *jus in bello*, the focus of the examination is whether the current laws and definitions provide sufficient clarity to help nation states resolve what is an armed attack in cyberspace. Unfortunately, international law fails to define “armed attack”. The Geneva Conventions and additional documents relating to the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), *jus in bello*, do provide definitions of related terms that can clarify what international law would likely consider an armed attack. The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols are “not a separate paradigm of conflict management,” but are focused on *jus in bello* issues.\nArticle 49 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I) defines “attack” as “acts of violence against the\n To use a college football analogy, the spread of the “West Coast Offense” to many universities has resulted in non-traditional powerhouse programs rising up and defeating Goliaths of the gridiron. Boise State University’s BCS victory over the University of Oklahoma highlights how smaller teams with allegedly lower quality recruits can use a new method of attack to level the playing field. In cyberspace operations, what is to stop a small nation state from responding with a non-attributable cyberspace operation in response to perceived threats or incursions by a “bullying” superpower? Even if the smaller state is questioned, it could respond that it is acting in self-defense to what it considered an armed attack with necessary actions to protect it from further harm. Such an asymmetric shift in warfare could result in an increasing number of “cyberspace conflicts” much like the low intensity conflicts of the 1980s. However, the capacity for “cyberspace conflicts” to rapidly escalate in lethality, due to self-defense actions, could be an incentive for nation states to instead look for a model that promotes deterrence.\n SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 77.\n\nadversary.\" The official commentary for Protocol I further adds that the definition “refers simply to the use of armed force to carry out a military operation.” Note that because this definition requires the use of armed force, non-military personnel hacking into the New York Stock Exchange and causing substantial economic harm would not be an attack. Such an application identifies practical limitations with the current definition in Article 49.\nCommon Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions states that the Conventions shall apply during “any other armed conflict,” yet that term is not well defined in the conventions. The official commentary to Common Article 2 helps in understanding what is an armed conflict and states that “de facto hostilities” are sufficient. The commentary then makes clear the Conventions’ intention for a low threshold and broad application of the term “armed conflict”:\nThe substitution of this much more general expression for the word \"war\" was deliberate. One may argue almost endlessly about the legal definition of \"war.\" A\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/470?OpenDocument. The United States has not ratified Protocol I, but it is accepted as customary international law. It is interesting to note that Article 49 further states:\n[The] provisions of this section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.\n*Id.* International law recognizes distinctions with regard to conducting hostilities in the domains of air and sea, yet there is no strong movement for international recognition of the distinctive qualities of the domain of cyberspace.\n Commentary for Protocol I, art. 49, para. 1882, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=470&amp;t=com.\n Even in 1977, international law failed to grasp the importance of economic battles that could bring a country to its knees.\n The four Geneva Conventions were signed on 12 August 1949. Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3114, 75 U.N.T.S. 31; Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3217, 75 U.N.T.S. 85; Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135; Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 75 U.N.T.S. 287. The Conventions and their commentaries are available on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) web page at: http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView. The Geneva Conventions represent customary international law with regard to the conduct of armed hostilities or *jus in bello*.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 73\nState can always pretend, when it commits a hostile act against another State, that it is not making war, but merely engaging in a police action, or acting in legitimate self-defence. The expression \"armed conflict\" makes such arguments less easy. Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, or how much slaughter takes place.\nIn addition to the above statement, each of the four commentaries to the Geneva Conventions provides slightly different amplifying language for Article 2. This is, no doubt, due to the specific context of each of the four Geneva Conventions. For example, with respect to the First Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, the Commentary adds:\nThe respect due to human personality is not measured by the number of victims. Nor, incidentally, does the application of the Convention necessarily involve the intervention of cumbrous machinery. It all depends on circumstances. If there is only a single wounded person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .\n Commentary to Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions. The quoted language is repeated in paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of each of the four Geneva Conventions. Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/365-570005?OpenDocument; Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/370-580005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600005?OpenDocument.\n Id. Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Geneva Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12 1949, provides almost identical language, with a minor distinction regarding shipwrecked persons: “If there is only a single shipwrecked person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .” Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the\n\nThus, what is clear from the Commentaries regarding when an “armed conflict” has occurred is not the number or persons involved or whether the parties are using “cumbrous machinery”, such as tanks, rockets, planes, etc., or “even if there has been no fighting,” but simply whether there is “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces.” Further, a consistent theme is that “armed conflict” usually involves some sort of negative impact on at least one person, even if it is a civilian victim. The Commentary language begs the question—a question not answered—what is “intervention of the armed forces?”\nIn sum, this discussion of the Geneva Conventions as they relate to *jus in bello* reveals that “armed conflict” is an activity that involves acts of violence between armed forces, which affect at least one person, regardless of the amount of damage or suffering inflicted. Overall, the threshold is quite low and certainly does not require significant damage or loss of life. The policy concern to protect people from the harsh effects of conflict most likely inspired such a low, almost bright-line approach. While the definitions and Official Commentaries of the Conventions help explore the issue, the U.N. Charter remains the principal document for analyzing *jus ad bellum* issues relevant to the armed attack determination.\n## D. Armed Attack and Jus ad Bellum\nUnfortunately, the U.N. Charter itself provides very little by way of definition when it comes to the term, “armed attack.” Moreover, no official commentary addresses the issue. However, one place scholars have turned for clarification is the U.N. General Assembly’s 1974 resolution defining aggression, Resolution Number 3314. In that resolution, the General Assembly defined aggression as the “use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or\nConvention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12 1949, provides the following minor distinction:\nIt makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces; it suffices for the armed forces of one Power to have captured adversaries falling within the scope of Article 4. Even if there has been no fighting, the fact that persons covered by the Convention are detained is sufficient for its application. The number of persons captured in such circumstances is, of course, immaterial.\nParagraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War simply clarifies with regard to civilians that the “respect due to the human person as such is not measured by the number of victims.”\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 75\npolitical independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\" More importantly, the resolution provides a number of specific acts that constitute aggression, including, but not limited to:\nInvasion, attack or military occupation; bombardment or the use of any weapons against a State; blockade; an attack on the land, sea, or air forces or the marine and air fleets of a State; and the sending of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries to complete any of the previous acts.\nThe resolution states that it may limit a finding of aggression in light of relevant circumstances, such as when the act is not of \"sufficient gravity.\" The pragmatic tone of this qualifying language is more consistent with how nation states subjectively conclude whether an armed attack occurred. The term \"sufficient gravity\" may be an unintended endorsement of the \"bully dilemma.\" Thus, the \"bully\" state again avoids accountability when the international community determines its small-scale aggression is not of \"sufficient gravity,\" i.e. the international community is not sufficiently concerned about their own safety and security. Unfortunately, subjective conclusions do not add much clarity to resolving what acts would be considered an armed attack in cyberspace. As noted above, such definitional clarity is essential to aiding all states in understanding which acts in cyberspace can result in self-defense actions. If there was a legal framework, which created a clearer understanding of one's accountability in cyberspace, there would be a greater likelihood of deterring states from acting\n G. A. Res. 3314, U.N. GAOR, 29th Sess., art. 1 (Dec. 14, 1974) available at http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/29/ares29.htm. This language is almost identical to the language found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n Id. art. 3.\n Mr. Sharp accurately notes that the United States uses the factors of scope, duration and intensity to determine whether de facto hostilities exist, but notes that the application has been inconsistent. When a Navy A-6 crew was shot down over Syria in 1983 and one of the crew members was captured, the U.S. claimed POW status for Lt Goodman and stated that “‘armed conflict’ includes any situation in which there is hostile action between the armed forces of two parties, regardless of the duration, intensity or scope of the fighting.” (emphasis added by this author) This is contrasted with the later U.S. position regarding the status of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant as an unlawful detainee, since the U.N. operations in Somalia “did not rise to the level of de facto international armed conflict.” SHARP, supra note 4, at 61-62. Essentially, Mr. Sharp’s position is that the U.S. position has evolved and now relies on the conjunctive “and” when applying the three factors of scope, duration, and intensity, versus the disjunctive “or.”\n\naggressively in cyberspace, because they would know which acts could result in a cyberspace self-defense action.\nWhether one looks to the “Schmitt analysis” using six factors or Sharp’s approach of “heuristic analysis” to develop a profile of how states apply the factors of scope, duration, and intensity to the U.N. Charter and Common Article 2 framework, there appears to be no clear answer in contemporary international law. Mr. Sharp, quoting Ian Brownlie, attempted to illustrate how international law can be applied during an international incident: “the minor nature of an attack” helps to prove the “intention to attack, of honest mistake, or simply the limited objectives of an attack.” Brownlie’s observation made sense in the days of conventional weapons and minor border skirmishes or incursions. One or two shots fired by a border guard versus dropping two 1,000 pound bombs can circumstantially help determine intent. Generally, with such kinetic attacks, the first or second order effects are readily discernable. However, warfare has changed and a new domain has evolved.\nIn cyberspace, what may appear as a “minor attack” could evolve into something much more destructive to a nation state, taking days or months to cause observable, significant harm. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks, and cyberspace attacks are quite different from the traditional methods of massing forces and building up logistics trains and lines of communication. States can much more easily identify preparation for a kinetic invasion versus a cyberspace onslaught. Asymmetric warfare may require asymmetric application of the law to provide the clarity and enforceability capable of promoting peace. The development of international law related to activities in cyberspace should not be delayed any longer.\nAnd why is finding a legally clear answer so difficult? In his writing, Sharp recognizes the concerns with a strict interpretation of Common Article 2, since such a “rote” application of the Article 2 threshold “intentionally causes military personnel to become belligerents and lawful targets even though they are conducting a peacetime military operation.” Sharp’s concern regarding a strict\n Recall the conclusion of supra note 17 regarding how the asymmetric nature of cyberspace warfare could result in an increasing number of conflicts, all with the potential of having substantially greater effects than traditional low intensity conflicts. This asymmetric nature has created a potential deterrence vacuum, which the law must attempt to fill and states must then enforce.\n SHARP, supra note 4, at 66 (quoting IAN BROWNLEIE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES, 366 (1954)).\n I refer the reader to the two lead-off quotes at the beginning of this article. The lack of clear, enforceable law will only embolden activities in cyberspace and increase international tension and the likelihood of substantial physical damage in addition to the on-going intellectual carnage.\n SHARP, supra note 4, at 65-66.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 77\napplication of Common Article 2 to *jus ad bellum*, conflict management, is certainly justified with regard to the evolution of conventional military activities, such as peacekeeping and peacemaking.\nCyberspace operations, however, do not create the same concerns related to peacekeeping operations. There has been no move to create a U.N. “cyberspace peacekeeping force” to engage in online actions to enforce U.N. resolutions or sanctions, and cyberspace forces are not conducting humanitarian missions. In addition, neither Common Article 2, the U.N. Charter, nor the U.N. definition of aggression are contemporary enough to be strictly applied to activities in cyberspace, since they lack definitions applicable to the unique methods used in cyberspace operations. Nevertheless, the policy objective and low threshold of Common Article 2 provide hope that international law is capable of applying a stricter, definition-based approach to cyberspace attacks. The need for a legally clear answer should help shift the focus from an ambiguous, effects-based approach that relies solely on international law to the development of a definition-based approach capable of consistent application to cyberspace operations that affect other states.\n## E. Weapons are the Key\nThe U.N. General Assembly’s defined aggression to include the use of “any weapons” against another state. The use of such a clearly broad term as “any” logically implies that the use of even minor weapons against a state could be considered an act of aggression, if the circumstances are of “sufficient gravity.” Leaving aside the inevitably ambiguous discussion of events that may be of “sufficient gravity” in the eyes of the U.N. General Assembly, the General Assembly’s inclusion of the use of weapons in its definition of aggression brings the discussion regarding armed attacks in cyberspace back to the initial proposal of analyzing cyberspace attacks using the criminal law model.\nThe criminal law model’s reliance on clear definitions requires us to focus on the causative event, versus emphasizing the effects. For example, a crime is committed when a person fires a gun toward another, regardless of whether the other person is actually struck by a bullet. The minimum crime is some type of assault, likely an aggravated one, in the absence of a legal defense. If the person is struck by the bullet (effect of attack) or other circumstances are developed to indicate a more serious intent, then the chargeable crimes range from aggravated assault to murder. As this example demonstrates, under a criminal law approach, a crime (attack) occurred under all of the factual variations. The increase in harm (effect) only increases the level of punishment the offender may face from society and does not influence whether a crime of some sort occurred.\n\nRegardless of the severity of the crime (attack), societies have long recognized the policy interest in taking measures to respond to and deter crimes. This deterrence objective is a philosophical difference between a criminal law approach and an effects-based approach relying on international law. International law, relying upon an effects-based threshold, is implicated only when an incident’s consequences rise above a certain threshold. Whereas the criminal law model reacts even if there is just an attempt to commit a prohibited act. Thus, a criminal law approach focuses on the actual act and the method used, whether accessing a computer without proper authorization or robbing a bank with a gun. Relying on the criminal law approach allows one to examine the genesis of an attack at an even deeper level. The criminal law approach strives to provide clarity and consistency, allowing all members of a society to know what conduct is prohibited, which also serves the additional objective of deterrence. In the case of defining cyberspace attacks, a consideration of cyberspace weapons is the key to providing such clarity.\nThe use of a weapon of some kind is the true genesis of an attack. In fact, the types of weapons available to a state determine the possible attack methodologies. Thus, studying weapons is also important to understanding the strategy of potential adversaries. However, for the purpose of providing clarity to the issue of armed attacks in cyberspace, the definition of what is a weapon in cyberspace becomes the foundational question to developing a new approach to international law affecting cyberspace operations.\nWhile the U.N. General Assembly used the term “any weapon” and provided no further definition of what constitutes a weapon, one can turn to the law of armed conflict (LOAC) for assistance. Based on the LOAC’s specific guidance regarding conventional tools of war, conventional militaries tend to have a practical understanding of what are lawful and unlawful weapons. For example, exploding bullets and poisonous gas are unlawful weapons. The LOAC focuses, however, almost completely on kinetic weapons.\nDespite its narrow focus on kinetic weapons, the LOAC has nevertheless struggled to define a “weapon,” and there is currently no\n For example, possessing and being able to field deep strike kinetic weapons such as low observable bombers opens up a range of options for a state actor. Likewise, possessing and being willing to use suicide bombers or biological weapons creates a tactical (asymmetric) advantage over adversaries. Thus, being able to conduct operations in cyberspace creates a new line of attack methods.\n Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Oct. 18, 1907, art. 23, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/195?OpenDocument [hereinafter Hague Regulation (IV)]. Article 23 outlaws weapons that cause unnecessary suffering. See also Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, Geneva, June 17, 1925.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 79\naccepted definition under international law. Instead, Article 36 of Protocol I requires a review of any “new weapon, means or method of warfare” to ensure its use would comply with international law. Although the United States has not ratified Protocol I, customary international law requires the review of weapons.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has noted that each state tends to have its own definition of “weapon.” Even within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) there is no standard definition of “weapon.” Thus, each service developed its own definition of weapon, which it uses to determine whether a means or method of warfare requires a legal review in accordance with Article 36 of Protocol I. In the Air Force, paragraph 1 of Air Force Instruction 51-402, Weapons Review, 13 May 1994, defines weapons as “devices designed to kill, injure, or disable people, or to damage or destroy property.” The definition specifically excludes “electronic warfare devices.” The definition also differentiates between effects on people and effects on property, failing to include devices that “disable” property. Meanwhile, the United States Army and Navy each provide a definition of weapon that specifically includes devices that “disable” property. Thus, the Army and Navy definitions appear to be more\n Throughout the remainder of the discussion, the term “weapon” will be used in lieu of the broader term, “weapon, means or method of warfare.”\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONS LAW DIV., OFFICE OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL, DEP’T OF THE AIR FORCE, AIR FORCE OPERATIONS &amp; THE LAW 25, 48 (1st ed. 2002).

THE KEY TO THIS PUZZLE: CYBERSPACE WEAPONS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW DEFINITION-BASED MODEL\n### A. Defining Cyberspace Weapons\nThe criminal law approach and methodology help resolve the issues of ambiguity, enforceability, and attribution for two reasons. First, it provides strong definitions that can withstand judicial scrutiny and allow for fair application to a variety of fact patterns. A nuance of this first strength is that criminal law definitions must also clearly put everyone on notice as to prohibited activities. The second strength is that the criminal law methodology requires the definition of a prohibited act to have some degree of intent, also known as the scienter element. Relying on these strengths, the criminal law approach creates a definition of a cyberspace crime that is clear, flexible, and requires a minimum level of intent. The criminal law methodology will then enable us to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace crime in order to establish the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nAs noted earlier, the European Union’s Convention on Cybercrime is an international treaty intended to create consistency in criminal laws related to internet activities. Unfortunately, the Cybercrime Convention does not offer a definition of malicious logic or cyberspace weapon. Instead, the Cybercrime Convention identifies specific activities states should criminalize. Logically, the reason to prohibit certain activities is to avoid unwanted effects. The criminal law methodology is able to transform unwanted effects into specific definitions and prohibitions, whereas the current approach under international humanitarian law relies on an ambiguous analysis of facts using undefined prohibitions.\nThe intent of the Cybercrime Convention was to set up a basic framework whereby the parties agreed to create their own state criminal codes to address broadly defined prohibited activities. Because the Convention defines prohibited activities broadly, it does not provide the detailed definitions of actual effects in cyberspace necessary to specifically define a cyberspace weapon. Nevertheless, the Convention’s aspirational criminal law definitions of unlawful activity in cyberspace can help identify the international community’s thoughts\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 81\nregarding unlawful cyberspace effects and thus the weapons that cause those effects. By looking at what types of activities the Cybercrime Convention intends to criminalize, it is possible to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nSpecifically, the Cybercrime Convention provides that the parties will adopt laws that criminalize cyberspace crimes such as: unlawful access, unlawful interception, interfering with data or systems, and computer fraud or forgery. Looking at the broad definitions for these offenses under the Cybercrime Convention, terms such as “obtaining,” “damaging,” “deleting,” “deteriorating,” “altering” or “suppressing” data represent a common theme of what happens to electromagnetic data when a cyberspace crime occurs.\nThis criminal law framework parallels the scenarios discussed by many others with regard to armed attacks in cyberspace. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense defines Computer Network Attack as: “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.” Whether a cyberspace crime or a cyberspace attack, the goal is to affect someone else’s data, or use data to affect property.\nThe domain of cyberspace is obviously not as physically transparent as the domains of air and space. If one were to try and “fire” one million volts at a cyberspace target, there are too many information nodes, such as routers and switches, along the internet pathway that would become the unintended recipient of the “electromagnetic missile.” The one million volt “electromagnetic missile” would cause\n See Convention on Cybercrime, supra note 10, at arts. 2-8.\n Id. arts. 4, 5. Article 4 provides:\nData interference: 1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data without right. 2. A Party may reserve the right to require that the conduct described in paragraph 1 result in serious harm.\nArticle 5 provides:\nSystem interference: Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.\n JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUB. 1-02, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS 113 (17 Mar. 2009) [hereinafter JP 1-02].\n\ncollateral damage to those nodes and would be worn down long before it reached its intended target. Cyberspace attacks, just like criminal hacks, are designed to affect electromagnetic data in various ways, which then impact the adversary's cyberspace to create an operational advantage for the attacker. Thus, the basic legal framework of the Cybercrime Convention is beneficial in the context of military operations in cyberspace.\nAlthough the Cybercrime Convention does not provide definitions of key terms such as \"damaging\" or \"altering,\" the Cybercrime Convention points us to the criminal codes of party states, such as the United States, to specifically define the actus reus. The criminal code of the United States is considered for several reasons: the United States invented the internet; the United States is arguably the largest user of cyberspace; the United States is a leading prosecutor of cyberspace crimes; and many nations work with the United States to solve cyberspace crimes.\nSection 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes intentionally causing damage to a protected computer.[42] Section 1030 is often used by U.S. Attorneys to prosecute persons who steal or corrupt data located on computer systems and persons who engage in denial of service attacks. Section 1030 defines \"damage\" as \"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.\" This definition of \"damage\" recognizes the reality of what happens during a criminal hack or a cyberspace attack: \"damage\" in cyberspace does not require smashing, burning, or blowing things up. The U.S. Code provides a clear, judicially accepted and internationally recognized definition of damage in the cyberspace realm. By borrowing from this definition, it is possible to logically develop a definition of a cyberspace weapon, the key to the puzzle.[43]\nFrom the above, we see that in its most simple terms, the definition of a weapon is \"something that causes damage.\" Applying the definition of damage from Section 1030, I propose the following definition of a cyberspace weapon: Any capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.[44] Although the proposed definition uses the term\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n\n## B. Applying the Definition of a Cyberspace Weapon\nNow that we have defined cyberspace weapon, the remaining challenge is to determine whether the proposed definition works within the context of cyberspace operations and within the current limits of international law. While the first instances of negative code may not have been written with the intent of harming a computer, today the story is quite different. Today, the development of computer code that negatively impacts an information system has evolved and spread like an advanced, persistent plague. The tools of the modern hacker, whether criminal, military, terrorist, geek, or spy, are broadly referred to as malicious logic. While malicious logic can take many forms, the key question for our purposes is: “At what point does malicious logic become a cyberspace weapon, the use of which constitutes an armed attack under international law?” The first part of the question focuses not on the end result but on the “tool” used in cyberspace and whether that tool is a “weapon.” The second part of the question will focus on the weapon’s use in cyberspace.\nFirst, one must consider whether particular cyberspace “tools” constitute weapons under international law. The ICRC Commentary on Article 35 of Additional Protocol I states: “The words ‘methods and means’ include weapons in the widest sense, as well as the way in which they are used.” Furthermore, the ICRC Guide on New Weapons expounds on the above commentary provision by noting that the legal\n Again, recall that while the services’ definitions of weapon all used the term “disable,” JP 1-02, supra note 41, uses the term “degrade” when describing Computer Network Attack.\n Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1402 (for art. 35). Article 35 provides overarching guidance regarding the means and methods of warfare and reads:\nBasic rules - 1. In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. 2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. 3. It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.\nProtocol I, supra note 19, at art. 35.\n\nreview requirements of Article 36 apply even to non-lethal weapons based on “the ways in which these weapons are to be used pursuant to military doctrine, tactics, rules of engagement, operating procedures and countermeasures” and also applies to all acquired weapons, whether procured based on military specifications or “off-the shelf.”47 Both the Commentary and the ICRC guide conclude that the analysis regarding whether a weapon is lawful or unlawful should be focused on the weapon’s “normal or expected use.”48\nNext, one must analyze how the proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon can be applied in the real-world context of two recent “cyberspace attacks” in Estonia and Georgia. Considering the realities of these two events, does the proposed definition provide sufficient clarity for use in international law?\nThe cyberspace event in April and May of 2007 in Estonia involved a number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) actions against the networks for the two largest banks, effectively severing all internet communications for two hours and causing partial interruptions thereafter.49 The event also included acts against an Estonian government internet service provider that “disrupted government communications for at least a short period of time.”50 Lastly, the web page for the Estonian Prime Minister was “defaced,” manipulating it to show an alleged apology for moving a Soviet World War II memorial.51 Clearly, the event in Estonia resulted in reduced availability and impaired the integrity of the information located on computer systems in Estonia. Applying the attacker’s methods to the proposed definition, it is clear these methods constituted “cyberspace weapons.”\nThe cyberspace event that occurred in July and August of 2008 in Georgia results in a similar conclusion. Again, a DDoS event targeted the website of the Georgian President, making it unavailable for 24 hours. Attackers also defaced the website with pictures of Adolf Hitler next to the image of the Georgian President, and, using malicious logic, caused websites for other government agencies to lose connectivity.52 Here again, the methods used by cyberspace attackers in Georgia caused a loss of access and impaired the integrity of the data. Consequently, it is appropriate to label these methods as “cyberspace weapons.” The proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon therefore\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 85\n\nprovides the degree of clarity to move the discussion forward to defining a cyberspace attack.\n## C. When is the Use of a Cyberspace Weapon a Cyberspace Attack?\nAcknowledging that cyberspace weapons were used in the events in Estonia and Georgia does not answer the ultimate question of whether the acts should be considered armed attacks under international law? Here again, the temptation is to return to an effects-based analysis to answer the question. However, as noted at the beginning of this article, previous attempts to answer the question using such an analysis provide ambiguous answers at best. Instead, by applying a definition-based approach, much like the criminal law does, there is a higher likelihood of reaching a clear answer. Therefore, in order to determine when the use of a cyberspace weapon constitutes an “armed attack” under international law, one must look to how the cyberspace weapon is used rather than its effects.\nThis question of how a weapon is used is the key transitional point in this analytical approach and borrows substantially from the criminal law. For example, a gun can either be a weapon used to kill people or a weapon used to assist a hunter in gathering food. The intent of the user remains the primary issue under the criminal law. Using this criminal law approach will enable conversion of the above question into a definition applicable to the international law arena.\nTo prove an offense under the criminal law, almost all crimes require proof of *mens rea*, the idea of a criminal intent or purpose. Specifically, most crimes require proof of either specific or general intent or knowledge. The most difficult *mens rea* to prove is specific intent, whereas knowledge is much more easily inferred from the circumstances. Considering history and the unwillingness of state actors to admit their actual intent, proving the specific or general intent of a state actor is very difficult when relying on circumstantial evidence, and would therefore result in an unenforceable definition beneficial only to academic discussions.\nTherefore, because proof of knowledge is easier to prove than either a specific or general *mens rea*, it will lead to a more enforceable standard and place a higher level of responsibility on states. Even though knowledge is a lower threshold than specific or general intent, it is nevertheless a common and accepted *mens rea* requirement under criminal law. Still, the question remains, knowledge of what? As will be discussed further below, state actors have a responsibility, as sovereigns with power and control, to conduct their affairs with due regard for their international legal obligations when they have knowledge of activities within their legal or physical boundaries. Hence, it is appropriate to consider the following definition of a\n\n\"cyberspace attack\": A cyberspace attack occurs when a state knowingly uses or knowingly acquiesces to an entity under its legal control or within its territory using a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state.\nThe proposed definition of cyberspace attack essentially imposes additional responsibility under international law when a state knowingly allows a person or entity to use a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state. Under the unique circumstances of cyberspace, such a clear definition establishes the increased degree of responsibility necessary to promote international peace and help deter the myriad of adverse activities in cyberspace. Consider the actions of one rogue group if they were to successfully conduct a cyberspace attack against the critical infrastructure of another state. Regardless of the group's motives, whether nationalistic, ideological, or criminal, causing the death of several hundred people and millions of dollars worth of property damage is a scenario that international law must evolve to address and deter. Still, if the state is completely unaware of a rogue element's activities, then it seems appropriate not to impart responsibility and accountability under international law.\nHowever, what if the state that can legally control the rogue element knew that the element was about to or was currently engaging in a cyberspace attack against persons or property in the victim state? The responsible state could, if necessary, disrupt all communications originating from the rogue element or emanating from the state until it could locate and arrest the attackers for violating their domestic laws. The definition of a cyberspace attack, although similar to the definition of a cyberspace crime, is not intended to hold states responsible for the nefarious efforts of criminals, unless the state is aware of the criminal's efforts and knowingly acquiesces to the use of a cyberspace weapon. The objective is to develop a legal framework that inspires states to cooperate to eliminate the harmful use of cyberspace—to create deterrence.\nWithout the proposed legal framework, why should a state try to stop an impending cyberspace attack against another state? Under current state practice, if the victim state is an \"ally,\" then the responsible, \"host\" state will likely feel much more compelled to take positive steps to stop the attack. For example, if a hacker in the United Kingdom was conducting a cyberspace attack against the Hoover Dam in the United States, U.K. security and law enforcement officials would almost certainly act with all diligence to stop the attack and arrest the perpetrators, and would likely allow their extradition to the United States.[53] However, how many cyberspace events against entities in the\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n\nSome argue that international law may not be inclined to place such a clear responsibility on states for acquiescing to uses of cyberspace weapons, unless they caused effects equivalent to more traditional armed attacks. However, the United Nations has issued resolutions that appear to place a higher burden on states to refrain from acquiescing to certain acts committed from their territory against other states. For example, a General Assembly Resolution in 1970, number 2625, discussed acquiescence and said that states have a duty to refrain from acquiescing or tolerating actions from within its territory that cause civil strife in the other state. More recently, the United Nations\nof U.S. military servers in 2001 and 2002.

Res. 2625, U.N. GAOR, 25th Sess. (Oct. 24, 1970). The key excerpts from the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among states in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations are:\nEvery State has a duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting, or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force . . .\nAlso, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State. . .\nStates have the duty to co-operate with one another, irrespective of the differences in their political, economic and social systems, in the various spheres of international relations, in order to maintain international peace and security . . .\nAll states enjoy sovereign equality. They have equal rights and duties . . .\nThe principles of the Charter which are embodied in this Declaration constitute basic principles of international law . . .\n\nSecurity Council issued Resolution 1373 on September 28, 2001, which reaffirmed the key principles in Resolution 2625. Resolution 1373 decided under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that all states shall take the necessary steps to prevent terrorist acts, to prevent terrorists from using their territories for terrorist purposes, and to provide early warning to other states.\nAlthough not directly on point with all scenarios of cyberspace attack, some cyberspace attacks could fit within the resolutions’ already accepted prohibitions related to harboring terrorists, preventing use of territory by terrorists, and acquiescing to those who cause civil strife. The proposed definition of armed attack in cyberspace would really only increase the degree of state responsibility for non-state actors by a small amount. In light of the growing concern related to the impact of non-state actors on international peace, and considering the asymmetric and potentially dangerous attributes of cyberspace, such an increase in state responsibility is not unreasonable.\nThe strength of the proposed definition of cyberspace attack is that it would place a clear responsibility on all states. All states would know what international law requires and non-state actors would know that their actions could be considered armed attacks. Although clear and strict in comparison to the current approach, the proposed legal threshold is not improperly low. It has a reasonable *mens rea* requirement, to wit: the host state must have knowledge of the impending or ongoing use of a cyberspace weapon. Because the proposed definition requires knowing acquiescence, a state can claim the defense of impossibility. For example, the host state may have no knowledge of an ongoing cyberspace attack because the rogue element first hacked into and gained control of the entire host state’s communications infrastructure. Still, once the host state became aware of the intended location of the attack, it would then be responsible to at least communicate that information to the victim state and continue to take reasonable measures to stop or impede the attack and cooperate with the victim state.\nThe unique attributes of cyberspace, such as its speed and lack of physical borders, are key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory when they do not take reasonable measures to stop the attack and warn the victim state. One cannot overemphasize the potency of the asymmetric capabilities of cyberspace in comparison to any other war-fighting domain in the world’s history, a capability that enables almost any person to engage in actions with\n S.C.

Therefore, another difference between the proposed definition and current requirements under international law is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack does not include a requirement that the attack involve the armed forces of the aggressor, as the commentary to Common Article 2 requires and the U.N. definition of aggression implies. However, the U.N. definition of aggression clearly includes mercenaries and irregulars. Once more, considering the asymmetric nature of cyberspace, requiring a cyberspace attack to involve the armed forces or mercenaries of the aggressor would create a legal hole big enough for hundreds of thugs and brigands to \"attack\" the victim state. In consideration of the incredible amount of physical or information damage that non-state actors can cause in cyberspace, knowing acquiescence to such attacks is the correct standard for imposing state responsibility under international law.\nBut, is it fair to impose such strict accountability on the use of cyberspace, when some cyberspace attributes, such as ease of access and use, are similar to those of global commons? For example, some may argue that the proposed definition is contrary to Article 8 of the Hague Regulation (V).[57] Article 8 provides that “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” It is accepted that many cyberspace communications occur over “telephone cables” and similar telecommunications infrastructure. Thus, the language of Article 8 is applicable to cyberspace operations. Article 8 clearly does not place a duty on a neutral power to forbid or restrict belligerents from using their communications infrastructure. In fact, Article 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) states that any restrictive measures implemented by a neutral power must be equally applied to “both belligerents.” Article 8’s language, therefore, appears to contradict the proposed definition.\nAlternatively, one could argue that the proposed definition of cyberspace attack does not conflict with Article 8, because the proposed definition creates a transitional status for a state. Once a state becomes aware of a cyberspace attack originating from its territory and targeting another state, it is no longer a \"neutral power\" and now must act to stop the attack or become a de facto \"belligerent.\" The idea of a state transitioning between being a neutral power and a belligerent may be too tenuous for realistic application in international law. In the alternative, states could choose, when adopting the proposed definition\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nof cyberspace attack, to explicitly state that Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) no longer apply to cyberspace.\nGoing back to the Estonia and Georgia events, most media attributed the use of cyberspace weapons to Russian internet addresses. Despite early and widespread media attribution to Russia, the attacks continued, strongly implying that Russia was directly responsible for the attacks. Apparently, Russian law enforcement and security services made no effort to stop the cyberspace attacks. Russia was certainly on notice that the world community believed the cyberspace attacks were originating from within its borders. While circumstantial evidence clearly indicated that Russia knowingly acquiesced to these attacks, there was no direct evidence. Reviewing the circumstantial evidence under the proposed definition indicates that Russia violated international law and the victim states had the right of self-defense. However, relying on circumstantial evidence is not something the international community and international law are generally comfortable doing.\nThis lack of direct evidence is indicative of the attribution problem currently hindering all investigations of actions in cyberspace. Investigators of domestic cyberspace crimes meticulously use forensic tools to identify which specific internet protocol (IP) address is responsible for a cyberspace crime and then interview the suspect to determine their level of knowledge or intent. Unfortunately, overseas investigations can only be accomplished if there is cooperation between the involved states. When a foreign state does not provide equal access to forensic evidence and suspects, the attribution barrier obstructs the inquiry and protects the “attacker.” Such actions do not promote peace or resolve conflict.\nThe effects-based model would likely conclude that the Estonia and Georgia attacks were not severe enough to be considered armed attacks or even an unlawful use of force. There were no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack. The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy. Reviewing the international reaction after the fact, there were no declarations by the international\n Arthur Bright, *Estonia accuses Russia of ‘cyberattack,’* CHRISTIAN SCI.

Charter or that they created de facto hostilities under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions. Estonia chose not to consider them armed attacks, while the Georgia situation simultaneously devolved into a kinetic conflict. What option did Estonia really have? If Estonia felt it had sufficient attribution, Estonia could have considered the acts armed attacks, creating a de facto state of hostilities and requested the assistance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under the NATO Treaty’s collective self-defense provision. Estonia could have waited for NATO to risk war with Russia. Estonia could also have responded in self-defense with conventional, kinetic forces, since they did not have any “cyberspace forces.” The potential result could have been a strong conventional response from Russia, including occupation of Estonia. Again, the “bully dilemma” reared its head. This prompts the question, is it fair to rely on a 60 year-old conventional model that gives such weight to state practice when the kinetic forces and available cyberspace capabilities are so disproportionate?\nIndeed, continued reliance on such a model could lead “minor” states to develop cyberspace forces in an effort to achieve an asymmetric advantage over states with much larger kinetic capabilities, leading to a cyberspace arms race and possibly more conflicts. As the Estonia and Georgia events demonstrate, when a state knowingly chooses to not assist a victim state or hold responsible those who use cyberspace weapons against other states, international law should view that state as a transgressor.\nThat is what the proposed definition of cyberspace attack intends to do. The proposed definition will have a positive impact on international law and conflict management, because it will clearly place\n North Atlantic Treaty art. 5, Apr. 4, 1949, 63 Stat. 2241, 34 U.N.T.S. 243. Article 5 states:\nThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.\n\nresponsibility on all states to not engage in cyberspace attacks and to police and secure their cyberspace “borders.” Essentially, everyone will know a cyberspace attack when they see it, and everyone will know that any state that conducts or permits such an attack could suffer self-defense actions and international sanctions. The end result would hopefully be a dramatic decrease in cyberspace events of foreign origin, which would also reduce the likelihood of a cyberspace “arms race” and cause the de-escalation of low intensity conflicts in cyberspace.\n## D. Flies in the Ointment: Attribution and Espionage\nAs referenced above, an effects-based approach magnifies the attribution problem, because it requires attribution of intentional direct participation or support by the state actor, versus knowing acquiescence. The difficulty of attribution in cyberspace prevents the evolution of realistic customary norms. No state actor can realistically consider the full spectrum of actions, because they do not know who acted against them or why. In addition, the difficulty in comprehending the full severity of the “attack,” because of the delayed effects of cyberspace weapons, compounds the difficulty in determining an appropriate response.\nUnlike the effects-based approach, the proposed definition does not require determining who controlled or supported the activity, the aggressor’s intent, or the full magnitude of the attack. Using the\n The concept of boundaries and sovereignty in cyberspace is also a topic of discussion amongst academics and practitioners. Although there is no clear definition and enforcement of boundaries in cyberspace, all states should recognize that electronic communications of all types originate in one state and can terminate (and have effects) in another state. Therefore, a state can monitor communications occurring inside its geographic borders. For example, the NSA under the Terrorist Surveillance Program was able to monitor communications where one party was located “outside” the United States. White House Press Briefing, Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales &amp; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, Principal Deputy Dir. of Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2005/intell-051219-dni01.htm. The concept of cyberspace borders has even been expanded to include discussions of a cyberspace Monroe Doctrine with regard to cyberspace infrastructure associated to the United States. See Reviewing the Federal Cybersecurity Mission: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Homeland Sec., Sub-Comm. on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, &amp; Sci. &amp; Tech., 110th Cong. (2009) (statement of Mary Ann Davidson, Oracle Security Officer), available at http://homeland.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20090310143850-78976.pdf.\n Relying on a heuristic analysis of past actions is somewhat similar to how scientists conduct scientific experiments and then analyze the results. In order for scientific experiments and their results to be reliable, external factors must be eliminated or controlled, and all other factors must be accurately known. The lack of attribution makes it impossible to accurately complete a heuristic analysis, since three of the most important factors, identity, intent, and full severity of attack, will rarely be known without it.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 93\ndefinitional approach, only two questions need to be resolved. First, was a cyberspace weapon used against the property or persons of a state? Second, did a foreign state knowingly allow an entity under its legal control to use the cyberspace weapon against the victim?\nEven with the proposed definitions and a two element test, one of the oldest arts, espionage, can still take advantage of the attribution difficulties in cyberspace. Espionage has long been recognized as essential to the success of states and their militaries. While a criminal offense in virtually every nation state, espionage is not a violation of the law of war and was first recognized in the Lieber Code in 1863. It was subsequently codified in the 1907 Hague Regulations and in Protocol I. Acts deemed to be espionage will not trigger a state’s right to self-defense, because espionage does not violate international law. Based on the definitions from the various documents considered part of customary international law, the consistent requirement for espionage is that a member of the armed forces gathers or attempts to gather information under false pretenses or while not wearing their uniform.\nSuch a definition does not perfectly transfer over to espionage in cyberspace. Whether the person at the other computer terminal is wearing his uniform is irrelevant to attributing his identity and intent in cyberspace. Still, a cyberspace spy will intrinsically gain access to the information or data under false pretenses. The average cyberspace intruder does not disclose his identity nor does he come to the main web page and ask the webmaster for permission. Instead, he exploits vulnerabilities in software coding that allow him to gain unauthorized access, which is essentially under false pretenses as discussed in Article\n Sun Tzu stated: “So, as for enlightened lords or distinguished commanders, the reason they can overcome the adversary when action is taken and achieve unparalleled success is prescience. Prescience cannot be gained from ghost or gods . . . . It must be gained from what is learned by men.” SUN TZU, SUN TZU: THE NEW TRANSLATION 112 (J. H. Huang trans. 1993).\n FRANCIS LIEBER, INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIELD, ART. 88 (Apr. 24, 1863), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/110?OpenDocument [hereinafter LIEBER CODE]. Article 88 defines a spy as: “a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy.”\n Article 29 of Hague Regulation (IV), supra note 33, defines a spy thus:\n[A]cting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information, are not considered spies.\nArticle 46 of Protocol I, supra note 19, provides that a member of the armed forces shall not be considered a spy “unless he does so through an act of false pretences or deliberately in a clandestine manner.”\n\nIt is certainly possible for cyberspace spies to gain access to information and copy or degrade the data without the use of a cyberspace weapon. However, the tension between lawful espionage and armed attack in cyberspace occurs when a spy uses a cyberspace weapon to access or steal information. If a traditional spy uses a weapon, such as a pistol, the act is viewed as a criminal act, versus an armed attack. Should the same be true of a cyberspace spy who hacks into a system by using a cyberspace weapon? Applying the proposed definition of cyberspace attack, the use of a cyberspace weapon while committing espionage in or through cyberspace could be interpreted as a cyberspace attack and result in self-defense actions.\nThe only way to resolve the tension between cyberspace espionage and cyberspace attack is to determine whether the cyberspace intruder intends solely to copy and then steal the data or information. Again, this dilemma adds a layer of complexity to the attribution issue by now requiring a determination of the actor’s full intent, creating an untenable situation for the victim state. Given that actions happen so fast in cyberspace, a spy or attacker could move “in and out” before a victim state could do any more than determine the foreign internet protocol (IP) address of the intruder. A full damage assessment, identifying what happened to the victim computer system could take hours to weeks. While some cyberspace attacks may be obvious, many will not be, as the beauty of cyberspace warfare is the ability to create second and third order effects, which are difficult to identify in advance.\nThe attribution issue reaches a pinnacle of complexity when trying to resolve events between espionage and cyberspace attacks. Therefore, today, a victim state is left with three choices: (1) continue to operate in the current international system of subjective analysis and inconsistent past responses while ineffectively trying to gather very detailed attribution information; (2) develop a robust cyberspace force capable of conducting cyberspace attacks, cyberspace espionage, and able to “hack back” to develop reasonably detailed attribution information; (3) or issue an ultimatum to the international community, hoping that others will agree, which informs all other states that any activity in that state’s territory that is determined to satisfy the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack will justify self-defense actions by the victim state.\n Phishing or spear phishing emails target known users on a network and always provide a false reason for the recipient to provide key information or click on a hyperlink that will then redirect the user to another web page where malicious code, read weapon, will be surreptitiously installed on the user’s computer.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 95\nThe difficulty with resolving the espionage issue is that under the first option a state remains vulnerable to many forms of cyberspace attack while attempting to resolve whether the event is an act of espionage or cyberspace attack and waiting for the international community to subjectively analyze the evidence. In addition, the evidence to satisfy the international community would likely include the elusive proof of actual intent to harm the victim state. Adversarial states could choose to take advantage of this slow analysis and decision loop, achieving paralysis by analysis, and methodically weaken a state with what appears to be cyberspace espionage but is in fact a number of cyberspace attacks aimed at creating third order effects. Lastly, it appears that states are not willingly sharing the details of their cyberspace activities with others, which still leaves a void of necessary information to conduct the required heuristic analysis to develop the law under the current framework.\nThe second option will help the state protect itself from adversarial activities in cyberspace and possibly lead to attributable information. In spite of this benefit, the potential of a cyberspace arms race increases. This development could lead to an increase in low scale cyberspace conflicts and ultimately result in an adversary conducting a second or third order cyberspace attack inflicting massive casualties or property damage.67 The continued development of cyberspace capabilities appears to be the current direction of the leading states, such as China, Russia, and the United States. States certainly cannot be faulted for taking such an approach, as the current international legal scheme offers them very little protection yet many opportunities to exploit the cyberspace of other states. Therefore, the race for dominance in cyberspace has begun and may soon grow out of control.\nThe second option also has some parallels to the approach that states took when nuclear tensions were high during the Cold War. The superpowers recognized that conventional methodologies could not be applied to the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). States recognized that Article 51’s right of self-defense limited them to proportional actions. However, due to the overwhelming effect and fairly rapid speed of any nuclear attack, states were doctrinally prepared to respond in full at the first indication of even a limited attack, since they recognized that they could not afford to wait and see how many warheads or which locations the adversary’s warheads hit and how much damage they caused. Superpowers projected that they were capable, prepared, and willing to respond to even a limited, targeted nuclear first-strike with a full-scale response.\n\nHistorically, one can see how nation states adopted their practice in light of the dramatic increase in speed and lethality of nuclear attacks using ICBM’s compared to the previous conventional method of warfare, circa World War II. While many decried the age of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and called it “mad,” one cannot dispute that during that time period, even though there was a nuclear arms race, no nuclear weapons were used. Mad or not, MAD was an effective method of deterrence. There are a number of parallels between the use of ICBMs and cyberspace operations: cyberspace attacks have the potential for incredible lethality; much greater speed than previous weapons; and the actual severity of the threat, the intent, and the identity of the actor are usually too difficult to determine in sufficient time to respond appropriately before the damage is done.\nHowever, there is one crucial difference between today’s option two situation (developing a robust cyberspace force and “hacking back”) and the deterrence model of MAD during the Cold War. Currently, it does not appear that a substantial number of states are willing to make a declaration of mutually assured destruction through cyberspace and simultaneously abstain from conducting cyberspace operations. Without such declarations and cessation of the use of cyberspace weapons, the parallels with the Cold War nuclear deterrence model end. Pragmatically, states do not feel the impetus to consider such an approach. There has been no mass disaster or 9-11 type “wake-up call” in cyberspace, and, as noted above, a number of states likely believe they can “win” in cyberspace. Therefore, applying the nuclear deterrence model to cyberspace operations is not practical. Unfortunately, history has shown that society rarely chooses to collectively legislate against harm until after it suffers the consequences.\nStill, there is one historical example where society chose to proactively legislate and limit the weaponization of a domain, much like option three. The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space. The third option can perhaps draw strength from the efforts to limit the militarization of space, recognizing cyberspace as a sort of international commons similar to outer space. Each state, relying on the proposed definitions, would still retain its sovereignty and control of cyberspace infrastructure located within its borders. The implementation of the proposed definitions would recognize that the use of cyberspace is intended for peace-promoting purposes and the use of weapons in cyberspace, even for espionage purposes, will not be accepted. Providing states the right of self-defense using the lower, clear threshold of the proposed\n Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Jan. 27, 1967, 6 I.L.M. 386, available at http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 97\ndefinitions will hopefully inspire states to abstain from cyberspace espionage and attacks and cooperate to protect the peaceful use of cyberspace.\n## IV. APPLYING THE DEFINITIONS AND EXERCISING SELF-DEFENSE IN CYBERSPACE\nIn order to further understand how option three’s (issuing an ultimatum that the state could respond in self-defense to cyberspace attacks) use of the proposed definitions will promote peace and reduce the improper use of cyberspace, it is helpful to explore how states could act in response to a cyberspace attack. The doctrine of self-defense relies on two principles: necessity and proportionality. Necessity involves whether effective peaceful means of resolution exist; the nature of the aggression, each party’s objectives, and the likelihood of effective intervention by the international community. Proportionality requires limiting the magnitude, scope, and duration of the force used in response to that which is reasonably necessary to counter the threat or attack. The timing of a self-defense action is closely related to the factor of necessity and is a debated issue. A delayed response weakens a state’s claim of necessity to defend itself. While an early response in anticipation of attack also draws questions as to the certainty of need for the self-defense action.\nLooking at necessity and the timing of self-defense actions in cyberspace, the unique qualities of cyberspace again highlight the importance of moving toward a deterrence model. Once a state suffers what it believes to be an armed attack in or through cyberspace, it can arguably satisfy the above requirements of necessity to defend itself. Unfortunately, in cyberspace, there will likely not be sufficient time to consider peaceful resolution of the matter, fully understand the nature of the attack or the intended results, or to mobilize international peacekeeping forces. Thus, the more difficult question related to necessity is how appropriate is anticipatory self-defense in cyberspace?\nAnticipatory self-defense “justifies use of force in anticipation of an ‘imminent’ armed attack.” Basically, a state need not wait to receive the aggressor’s attack and can instead act in self-defense to “repel” the attack. The doctrine “finds it roots in the 1837 Caroline case and subsequent correspondence between then-U.S. Secretary of\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK 4 (2007) [hereinafter U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK]; see also YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION AND SELF-DEFENCE (4th ed. 2005).\n U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 69.\n Id. at 6.\n Id.\n\nState Daniel Webster and his British Foreign Office counterpart Lord Ashburton.\"73 Secretary Webster informed Lord Ashburton that a state can act in self-defense when the circumstances are \"instantaneous, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation.\"74 The attributes of cyberspace, especially speed and lethality, seem quite similar to Secretary Webster's factors. Essentially, if a state is fortunate enough to develop information about a developing or planned cyberspace attack against it, the attributes of cyberspace may compel a state to act in its best interest and exercise anticipatory self-defense.\nThe follow-on question involves what a state can do in self-defense, i.e. how is the principle of proportional response applied in and through cyberspace? In cyberspace, there may be a number of ways to technically counter an attack. A state could disconnect itself from cyberspace. However, such a response seems disproportionately burdensome on the victim state and could cause other forms of harm internally. The victim state could quickly counter with anti-virus measures, although such efforts are always a game of \"catch-up.\" The victim state could respond by disconnecting all cyberspace connections with the aggressor state. However, this will only work as long as the aggressor state chooses not to attack through another state. Moreover, such actions require attribution.\nBecause a state needs to know against which state to exercise self-defense, developing reliable attribution represents another difficulty with applying age-old laws and methods to cyberspace. Given that a cyberspace attack comes from another country and could involve communications \"hopping\" through several other countries, it is nearly impossible for a state to develop attribution without first violating the cyberspace infrastructure and jurisdiction of other states. Currently, to avoid violating another state's cyberspace, states send requests for assistance to cooperating states. The victim state requests help in developing information about the IP address in question and also requests monitoring of that IP address, allowing the state to \"hop back\" to the next IP address, and then request more help. This \"hopping back\" process can be painful and long, leaving the victim state vulnerable. However, the traditional police doctrine of hot pursuit is expanding in international law. Under customary international law, ships and planes can follow offending vessels in hot pursuit up to another state's territorial sea or airspace.75 However, the European Union has adopted the Schengen Agreement that permits law enforcement officials to cross state borders when pursuing a criminal suspected of certain serious\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 99\n\noffenses The agreement provides that the pursuing officers will cease their pursuit upon request of the other state, however, the pursuing officers can request that the other state arrest the suspect.\nExtending the principles of the Schengen Agreement to the domain of cyberspace seems logical, because attacks in cyberspace are analogous to serious criminal offenses. Permitting hot pursuit is consistent with the proposed definition’s efforts to deter states from knowingly acquiescing to cyberspace attacks. Witting host states will find it much harder to hide in the shadow of attribution. Providing victim states with a legal “hot pursuit” capability, including proper coordination mechanisms, will be invaluable to promoting cooperation, reducing crime, and deterring attacks in and through cyberspace.\nWith the ability to more quickly attribute attacks, a state would then have other options to consider under the principle of proportionate response. The victim state could consider firing back in self-defense with a cyberspace weapon at the actual computer(s) used to attack it. This can be reasonably effective if a limited number of computers are involved. However, a victim state will likely remain concerned, due to its limited ability to determine whether more attacks or attacks of increasing severity will follow the initial round of attacks. This challenge may lead a state to consider more serious measures, such as responding with a self-defense attack that involves disrupting a substantial portion of the witting host state’s cyberspace. However, the collateral damage from such a self-defense action could be substantial. The questions of necessity and anticipatory self-defense also affect the proportionality decision. Moreover, nothing prohibits states from defending against a cyberspace attack by using kinetic weapons, such as striking a key communication node with a cruise missile or damaging a state’s communication satellite(s). The hypotheticals and the potential for conflict abound. Thus, the unique nature of cyberspace and the inability to clearly apply current international laws, norms, and practices make resolution of conflict extremely difficult, and should inspire states to seek a framework of cooperation and deterrence, such as the one I advocate in this article.\n\n# V. LOOKING FORWARD AND CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\nThe definitions proposed in this article provide a framework for consistency and an opportunity to level the playing field of international law. Today, states can either choose to continue with the status quo, or, recognizing the benefits of the peaceful use of cyberspace, embrace the need for clear definitions of cyberspace weapon and cyberspace attack. Embracing the definitions I propose would, at most, have a moderate impact on how international affairs are conducted today. The Schengen Agreement and the E.U. Convention on Cybercrime serve as models to build a framework of cooperation to promote peace and reduce crime. States would need to establish cyberspace communications centers, whereby each state would agree to pass information to another state as soon as it became aware of a cyberspace attack against a victim state, but is currently unable to halt the attack from affecting the victim state. The centers would also coordinate the hot pursuit issues related to developing attribution.\nThose states that choose not to adopt the proposed legal definitions and methods of cooperation would do so knowing that their actions or inaction could be viewed as a cyberspace attack. Each state would still continue to exercise its right of self-defense. Meanwhile, the international community could apply the new legal standard when considering whether to apply sanctions. The end result is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack with cooperative application under international law could make a powerful form of asymmetric warfare untenable before it develops into an arms race that leads to increased conflicts and harms people and property.\nWhen our predecessors developed the law of conflict management it is doubtful anyone could foresee the day when a state could attack another state simply by manipulating electronic data. Even the futuristic Buck Rogers and lasers still had visible, kinetic-like effects. Today, one must recognize that the lack of specific definitions for “weapon” and “armed attack” create an untenable vacuum in the evolving domain of cyberspace. So far, only the criminal law has provided thorough definitions in an attempt to keep pace with the development of nefarious tools in cyberspace. The criminal law methodology provides a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt such definitions to the various uses of prohibited cyberspace tools. The field of international law requires similar flexibility. This article attempted to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon from the criminal law’s efforts to specifically define the acts caused by cyberspace criminals. The\n A state could of course provide the information to the potential victim state, even if they were able to halt the attack before it caused harm. This extra level of cooperation would assist all states in developing their capabilities to detect potential cyberspace attacks.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 101\ncriminal law methodology facilitated the development of a definition of a cyberspace attack. By applying the current international law framework to the proposed definition of an armed attack in cyberspace, this article highlighted how such a definition could lead to parity in cyberspace and thereby promote peace through deterrence.",

Mr. Sharp suggests relying upon an analysis of how states have responded in previous cases to help analyze whether an unlawful use of force or armed attack have occurred, essentially relying on a normative analysis. Mr. Sharp summarizes his test by stating: “What constitutes a use of force of a scope, duration, and intensity that constitutes an armed attack and triggers the law of armed conflict is a question of fact that must be subjectively analyzed in each and every case in the context of all relevant law and circumstances.” SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 69. Michael Schmitt’s analytical approach involves six factors which are used to “délimit” economic/political coercion from determining what is a use of armed force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Mr. Schmitt’s premise for using an effects based approach primarily rests with his assessment that the U.N. Charter was not directly focused on outlawing “force” but rather the “deleterious consequences” of state actions, and outlawing uses of force under Article 2 was a “prescriptive short-hand to achieve their goals.” Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, *supra* note 4, at 911.

Fourth, there is an underdeveloped legal framework to guide response.\nThere is currently no international, legally binding instrument that would address cyberspace attacks as threats to national security.\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nChange has come and gone. While academics have been discussing methods to define the use of force in cyberspace, governments and policy makers may have missed an opportunity to shape the law of war. Just like a child “pinching” a peppermint from the candy store while the owner was not looking, someone may have successfully launched two cyberspace attacks, and no one called either one an unlawful use of force or armed attack. Did a state actor set a precedent that could become part of customary international law?\nEvery day there are new stories and developments about the increasing connectivity of people around the world spurred by the continued fast pace of technological developments in the computer and communications industries. Military applications of cyberspace are also rapidly evolving, moving the domain of cyberspace to the front lines of conflicts. But, the legal frameworks that regulate war or armed conflict are lagging far behind the technological changes that have already occurred. Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light. Unfortunately, law, especially international law, failed to keep pace with the new applications of existing technologies. On the criminal front, law enforcement agencies are swamped with allegations ranging from identity theft to theft of corporate data, while armed with only a marginally effective process to investigate, extradite, and prosecute international cyberspace criminals. However, the conduct of military operations in and through cyberspace, with potentially greater global implications, is bypassing the currently inadequate mire of international law. What if international law could provide a framework capable of enabling deterrence in cyberspace?\n U.S.-CHINA ECON. &amp; SEC.

Meanwhile, commercial internet service providers began offering services in the late 1980’s. Today, according to Wikipedia, there are more than 1 billion personal computers in use and more than 1 billion users of the internet. Wikipedia, Personal Computer, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer (last visited Mar. 15, 2009).\n\nScholars have written many articles regarding cyberspace attacks in the international regime and what constitutes a use of force or act of war in cyberspace. Yet, there is no consensus regarding how to define attacks in cyberspace under international law. The unique qualities of operations in cyberspace will make this the most difficult domain in which to resolve international disputes and conflict. In this article, I intend to offer a new methodology for determining armed attacks in cyberspace by using existing criminal law legal tools. Specifically, this methodology will borrow from the criminal law’s definitions of cyberspace crimes, in order to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon. More importantly, by defining cyberspace weapon, this methodology will enable the international community to define what constitutes a cyberspace attack. Providing the legal framework for a definition of cyberspace attack, such as the new methodology outlined in this article, will serve to reduce the potential for conflict in cyberspace.\nThe article will first examine cyberspace and how current approaches have attempted to apply international law to armed attacks in cyberspace. Looking through the lens of current international laws will highlight how the unique attributes of cyberspace could increase the likelihood of international conflict. The article will identify how the failure of international law to define armed attacks and weapons further exacerbates this problem. The article will then transition from current international laws to examine whether current criminal law definitions and methodologies can fill the gap and provide realistic definitions of weapons and armed attacks in cyberspace. Lastly, the article will put these proposed definitions to the test against the most challenging aspects of cyberspace: attribution and espionage.\n See, e.g., Michael N. Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework*, 37 COLUM. J.

APPLYING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBERSPACE ATTACKS: FALLING SHORT WITHOUT DEFINITIONS\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nFor the purposes of this article, I define cyberspace as *an evolving man-made domain for the organization and transfer of data using various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The domain is a combination of private and public property governed by technical rule sets designed primarily to facilitate the flow of information.* The key feature of cyberspace is that it is a man-made domain designed to transfer data and information.\nInformation is the reason cyberspace exists, and this feature makes current discussions involving the international law of conflict management, *jus ad bellum*, so different from traditional *jus ad bellum* discussions. Simply put, information is fundamentally different than the traditional tools of war; bits and bytes bear no physical resemblance to bullets and bombs. Michael Schmitt noted that cyberspace threats differ in four ways from traditional threats: (1) computer networks are a new target category, with computer network attacks capable of providing the same results as striking the traditional target with a kinetic weapon; (2) an attack does not have to use kinetic force and can solely involve a command from one computer to the target system; (3) the intended results are often not kinetic and could simply involve the manipulation of data or disruption of a service; and (4) cyberspace threats are not constrained by political boundaries or geography.\nI would add four more distinguishing factors between cyberspace threats and traditional or kinetic uses of force: (1) cyberspace attacks can be completed literally at the speed of light; (2) the results of some cyberspace attacks, whether intended or not, can be similar to those involving weapons of mass destruction; (3) the cost of acquiring the equipment and expertise to conduct operations in\n---\n This definition was developed jointly with my cyberspace law cohort, Major Noah Bledstein at 8 AF/JA. Major Bledstein has been working on cyberspace law issues since 2003. His assistance in discussing and developing the ideas and definitions in this paper was invaluable. It does not specifically address the issue of whether some part or all of cyberspace should be considered a global commons.\n Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, supra note 4, at 888.\n Because the infrastructure of modern societies relies on the technology and data which can be easily targeted during a cyberspace operation, the disabling of such infrastructure or manipulation of data could cause substantial damage and harm to a society. For example: disabling air traffic control systems or the systems which control the water flowing from a large dam, manipulating the data relied upon by banks or the International Monetary Fund, or manipulating the DNA coding for the subsequent year’s flu vaccine.\ncyberspace is *de minimis* in comparison to fielding conventional forces; and (4) attributing the attack to the responsible party and determining whether the attack was intentional or accidental is extremely difficult.\nThe attribution problem, which this article discusses throughout, is indeed the elusive factor that most severely complicates the application of international law. In fact, the attribution problem makes cyberspace so different from other mediums or domains that it requires an entirely new international law approach. The unique nature of the cyber domain impacts not only national level decisions but also the development of law in this area, as evidenced by the current state of law regarding cyberspace and conflict management, which is discussed below.\n## B. Current Legal Approaches to Cyberspace Attacks\nThe majority of scholars considering attacks in cyberspace have used an ambiguous, effects-based analytical approach relying on international law to determine what constitutes a “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter or whether an “armed attack” occurred under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. The discussions and articles have also looked to other treaties that comprise international law and the law of war, such as the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions. On first impression, an effects-based approach to the issue that relies on\n A nuance of limited attribution is that much of the public is unaware of what is going on in cyberspace. In the other domains where military operations are conducted, the activities are much more visible. However, in cyberspace, we can’t easily spot electrons and data packets whisking by us or through a phone line.\n *See supra* note 4. A brief description of two of the leading approaches follows: First, Gary Sharp’s approach recognizes that a use of force in cyberspace may rise to the threshold of an armed attack, depending on its “scope, duration, and intensity,” which are factors previously relied upon by the United States (*See infra* note 28). Mr. Sharp suggests relying upon an analysis of how states have responded in previous cases to help analyze whether an unlawful use of force or armed attack have occurred, essentially relying on a normative analysis. Mr. Sharp summarizes his test by stating: “What constitutes a use of force of a scope, duration, and intensity that constitutes an armed attack and triggers the law of armed conflict is a question of fact that must be subjectively analyzed in each and every case in the context of all relevant law and circumstances.” SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 69. Michael Schmitt’s analytical approach involves six factors which are used to “délimit” economic/political coercion from determining what is a use of armed force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Mr. Schmitt’s premise for using an effects based approach primarily rests with his assessment that the U.N. Charter was not directly focused on outlawing “force” but rather the “deleterious consequences” of state actions, and outlawing uses of force under Article 2 was a “prescriptive short-hand to achieve their goals.” Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, *supra* note 4, at 911. I would recommend that all practitioners in this area read both works. Mr. Sharp’s book is especially invaluable as a thorough review of international law that applies to cyberspace operations.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 69\ninternational law seems to make sense, since it is electromagnetic data that moves through cyberspace and then creates an electromagnetic effect at the terminating point. The actors certainly focus on what effects they can achieve in and through cyberspace. These effects-based approaches add considerable value to the discussion of the issue, but they are unnecessarily constrained by relying primarily on legal documents and customary international norms developed before the advent of mass-produced computers.\nThe only substantial international legal document developed to address issues related to cyberspace is the European Union's Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention). While the Cybercrime Convention does not address cyberspace attacks as possible acts of war and instead focuses on criminal acts, it does help establish a framework for a new methodology of analyzing cyberspace attacks. Instead of focusing on the end result of a cyberspace event, the effects, and trying to determine whether such an act is a use of force or armed attack under international law, a criminal law methodology places increased emphasis on the genesis of a cyberspace event. The criminal law approach thus focuses on defining the beginning of a cyberspace event and not the effects, and those definitions can then be applied to international law and military operations in cyberspace.\nBefore discussing the benefits of the criminal law approach, however, one must first understand how most commentators are currently applying international law to actions in cyberspace. A review of current scholarship on this issue will show the difficulty in applying decades old terms and norms to actions in cyberspace. As a starting point, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nHowever, without international sanctions there is little incentive for a party to comply with Article 2(4)’s peaceful objectives. The\n Convention on Cybercrime, Nov. 23, 2001, 2296 U.N.T.S. 167, available at http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm.\n U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4\n Id. Art. 1 of the Charter states the purpose of the Charter. Subparagraph 1 specifically states:\nTo maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.\n\nhistorical reality is that most state actors have not conducted themselves as though they feared some form of international punishment for their actions. By itself, Article 2(4) seems, therefore, to create very little deterrent effect in conflict management.\nHowever, in contrast to Article 2(4), Article 51 permits parties to act in self-defense in response to an “armed attack.” Pragmatically, this right of self-defense can have the quickest success at reducing illegal uses of force constituting breaches of the peace, thereby increasing the deterrent effect of international law. While it is important to analyze whether a state action is a threat or use of force, the more critical question is whether the action is an armed attack, authorizing the recipient to respond in self-defense? The right of self-defense puts other states on notice that their offensive actions could be met with military force.\nThe right of self-defense has historically been limited by the reality that smaller nation states would respond against bigger and more powerful states with conventional force only if an attack truly jeopardized its national survival. This could be called the “bully dilemma” of international law. The “bully dilemma” pragmatically disenfranchises smaller and weaker states from the protection of Article 51. If a “bully” state engages in a small-scale breach of the peace against a significantly smaller state that smaller state will likely\n Mr. Sharp reasons “a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), however, the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.” Mr. Sharp recognizes that his position may not be held by all and that any right of self-defense is limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity. SHARP, supra note 4, at 48-49.\n When there is a threat or use of force under Article 2, the United Nations can impose sanctions, to include armed intervention under Chapter 7. However, building the consensus for such actions often takes considerable time and debate, while the victims of such use of force wait for relief. Even the liberation of Kuwait took more than six months before U.N. authorized forces began significant operations to remove Iraqi forces.\n For example, when the United States launched cruise missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan in August 1998, neither country responded with conventional force. The codename for the operation was “Infinite Reach.” What if Sudan had then possessed a capability to respond in cyberspace? How could Sudan respond in cyberspace, and would the U.S. have countered, if attribution could be obtained?\n Mr. Sharp, on page 52 of CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE, supra note 4, concluded the third chapter of his book by stating “[t]here is no black and white, mechanical rule in the law of conflict management that clearly defines what a use of force is under all circumstances.” He then followed that statement by using the opposite of the “bully dilemma” to demonstrate his conclusion that a use of force is a question of fact which must be subjectively analyzed: “For example, a state’s activity that is lawful against another state of equal size may nevertheless be significant enough against a smaller state to cross Article 2(4)’s ‘political independence’ threshold.” A subjective “size matters” approach to law provides no clarity and leaves smaller states wondering whether they can seek international assistance or defend themselves.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 71\nacquiesce to the aggression. The smaller state will likely determine that it is better to suffer outright defeat than to attempt to stop the aggression and fail. Meanwhile, as noted above, sanctions under the U.N. Charter are rarely invoked against the “bully” state, especially when the “bully” state is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and therefore holds a veto.\nHowever, in contrast to the historical “bully dilemma,” as depicted above, the asymmetric nature of operations in cyberspace now allows any party to possess the capability to swiftly act in self-defense with incredible lethality. The “bully” could soon be extinct and a new era of conflict could unfold, where the appearance of parity could inspire more breaches of the peace. This is why the development of law in this area must move forward.\n## C. Looking to Jus in Bello to Define Armed Attack\nThe potential lethality of cyberspace responses and unique attributes of cyberspace should compel international lawyers to consider the right of self-defense against cyberspace attacks in light of both the *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum*. Beginning with *jus in bello*, the focus of the examination is whether the current laws and definitions provide sufficient clarity to help nation states resolve what is an armed attack in cyberspace. Unfortunately, international law fails to define “armed attack”. The Geneva Conventions and additional documents relating to the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), *jus in bello*, do provide definitions of related terms that can clarify what international law would likely consider an armed attack. The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols are “not a separate paradigm of conflict management,” but are focused on *jus in bello* issues.\nArticle 49 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I) defines “attack” as “acts of violence against the\n To use a college football analogy, the spread of the “West Coast Offense” to many universities has resulted in non-traditional powerhouse programs rising up and defeating Goliaths of the gridiron. Boise State University’s BCS victory over the University of Oklahoma highlights how smaller teams with allegedly lower quality recruits can use a new method of attack to level the playing field. In cyberspace operations, what is to stop a small nation state from responding with a non-attributable cyberspace operation in response to perceived threats or incursions by a “bullying” superpower? Even if the smaller state is questioned, it could respond that it is acting in self-defense to what it considered an armed attack with necessary actions to protect it from further harm. Such an asymmetric shift in warfare could result in an increasing number of “cyberspace conflicts” much like the low intensity conflicts of the 1980s. However, the capacity for “cyberspace conflicts” to rapidly escalate in lethality, due to self-defense actions, could be an incentive for nation states to instead look for a model that promotes deterrence.\n SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 77.\n\nadversary.\" The official commentary for Protocol I further adds that the definition “refers simply to the use of armed force to carry out a military operation.” Note that because this definition requires the use of armed force, non-military personnel hacking into the New York Stock Exchange and causing substantial economic harm would not be an attack. Such an application identifies practical limitations with the current definition in Article 49.\nCommon Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions states that the Conventions shall apply during “any other armed conflict,” yet that term is not well defined in the conventions. The official commentary to Common Article 2 helps in understanding what is an armed conflict and states that “de facto hostilities” are sufficient. The commentary then makes clear the Conventions’ intention for a low threshold and broad application of the term “armed conflict”:\nThe substitution of this much more general expression for the word \"war\" was deliberate. One may argue almost endlessly about the legal definition of \"war.\" A\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/470?OpenDocument. The United States has not ratified Protocol I, but it is accepted as customary international law. It is interesting to note that Article 49 further states:\n[The] provisions of this section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.\n*Id.* International law recognizes distinctions with regard to conducting hostilities in the domains of air and sea, yet there is no strong movement for international recognition of the distinctive qualities of the domain of cyberspace.\n Commentary for Protocol I, art. 49, para. 1882, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=470&amp;t=com.\n Even in 1977, international law failed to grasp the importance of economic battles that could bring a country to its knees.\n The four Geneva Conventions were signed on 12 August 1949. Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3114, 75 U.N.T.S. 31; Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3217, 75 U.N.T.S. 85; Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135; Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 75 U.N.T.S. 287. The Conventions and their commentaries are available on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) web page at: http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView. The Geneva Conventions represent customary international law with regard to the conduct of armed hostilities or *jus in bello*.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 73\nState can always pretend, when it commits a hostile act against another State, that it is not making war, but merely engaging in a police action, or acting in legitimate self-defence. The expression \"armed conflict\" makes such arguments less easy. Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, or how much slaughter takes place.\nIn addition to the above statement, each of the four commentaries to the Geneva Conventions provides slightly different amplifying language for Article 2. This is, no doubt, due to the specific context of each of the four Geneva Conventions. For example, with respect to the First Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, the Commentary adds:\nThe respect due to human personality is not measured by the number of victims. Nor, incidentally, does the application of the Convention necessarily involve the intervention of cumbrous machinery. It all depends on circumstances. If there is only a single wounded person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .\n Commentary to Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions. The quoted language is repeated in paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of each of the four Geneva Conventions. Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/365-570005?OpenDocument; Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/370-580005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600005?OpenDocument.\n Id. Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Geneva Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12 1949, provides almost identical language, with a minor distinction regarding shipwrecked persons: “If there is only a single shipwrecked person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .” Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the\n\nThus, what is clear from the Commentaries regarding when an “armed conflict” has occurred is not the number or persons involved or whether the parties are using “cumbrous machinery”, such as tanks, rockets, planes, etc., or “even if there has been no fighting,” but simply whether there is “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces.” Further, a consistent theme is that “armed conflict” usually involves some sort of negative impact on at least one person, even if it is a civilian victim. The Commentary language begs the question—a question not answered—what is “intervention of the armed forces?”\nIn sum, this discussion of the Geneva Conventions as they relate to *jus in bello* reveals that “armed conflict” is an activity that involves acts of violence between armed forces, which affect at least one person, regardless of the amount of damage or suffering inflicted. Overall, the threshold is quite low and certainly does not require significant damage or loss of life. The policy concern to protect people from the harsh effects of conflict most likely inspired such a low, almost bright-line approach. While the definitions and Official Commentaries of the Conventions help explore the issue, the U.N. Charter remains the principal document for analyzing *jus ad bellum* issues relevant to the armed attack determination.\n## D. Armed Attack and Jus ad Bellum\nUnfortunately, the U.N. Charter itself provides very little by way of definition when it comes to the term, “armed attack.” Moreover, no official commentary addresses the issue. However, one place scholars have turned for clarification is the U.N. General Assembly’s 1974 resolution defining aggression, Resolution Number 3314. In that resolution, the General Assembly defined aggression as the “use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or\nConvention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12 1949, provides the following minor distinction:\nIt makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces; it suffices for the armed forces of one Power to have captured adversaries falling within the scope of Article 4. Even if there has been no fighting, the fact that persons covered by the Convention are detained is sufficient for its application. The number of persons captured in such circumstances is, of course, immaterial.\nParagraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War simply clarifies with regard to civilians that the “respect due to the human person as such is not measured by the number of victims.”\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 75\npolitical independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\" More importantly, the resolution provides a number of specific acts that constitute aggression, including, but not limited to:\nInvasion, attack or military occupation; bombardment or the use of any weapons against a State; blockade; an attack on the land, sea, or air forces or the marine and air fleets of a State; and the sending of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries to complete any of the previous acts.\nThe resolution states that it may limit a finding of aggression in light of relevant circumstances, such as when the act is not of \"sufficient gravity.\" The pragmatic tone of this qualifying language is more consistent with how nation states subjectively conclude whether an armed attack occurred. The term \"sufficient gravity\" may be an unintended endorsement of the \"bully dilemma.\" Thus, the \"bully\" state again avoids accountability when the international community determines its small-scale aggression is not of \"sufficient gravity,\" i.e. the international community is not sufficiently concerned about their own safety and security. Unfortunately, subjective conclusions do not add much clarity to resolving what acts would be considered an armed attack in cyberspace. As noted above, such definitional clarity is essential to aiding all states in understanding which acts in cyberspace can result in self-defense actions. If there was a legal framework, which created a clearer understanding of one's accountability in cyberspace, there would be a greater likelihood of deterring states from acting\n G. A. Res. 3314, U.N. GAOR, 29th Sess., art. 1 (Dec. 14, 1974) available at http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/29/ares29.htm. This language is almost identical to the language found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n Id. art. 3.\n Mr. Sharp accurately notes that the United States uses the factors of scope, duration and intensity to determine whether de facto hostilities exist, but notes that the application has been inconsistent. When a Navy A-6 crew was shot down over Syria in 1983 and one of the crew members was captured, the U.S. claimed POW status for Lt Goodman and stated that “‘armed conflict’ includes any situation in which there is hostile action between the armed forces of two parties, regardless of the duration, intensity or scope of the fighting.” (emphasis added by this author) This is contrasted with the later U.S. position regarding the status of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant as an unlawful detainee, since the U.N. operations in Somalia “did not rise to the level of de facto international armed conflict.” SHARP, supra note 4, at 61-62. Essentially, Mr. Sharp’s position is that the U.S. position has evolved and now relies on the conjunctive “and” when applying the three factors of scope, duration, and intensity, versus the disjunctive “or.”\n\naggressively in cyberspace, because they would know which acts could result in a cyberspace self-defense action.\nWhether one looks to the “Schmitt analysis” using six factors or Sharp’s approach of “heuristic analysis” to develop a profile of how states apply the factors of scope, duration, and intensity to the U.N. Charter and Common Article 2 framework, there appears to be no clear answer in contemporary international law. Mr. Sharp, quoting Ian Brownlie, attempted to illustrate how international law can be applied during an international incident: “the minor nature of an attack” helps to prove the “intention to attack, of honest mistake, or simply the limited objectives of an attack.” Brownlie’s observation made sense in the days of conventional weapons and minor border skirmishes or incursions. One or two shots fired by a border guard versus dropping two 1,000 pound bombs can circumstantially help determine intent. Generally, with such kinetic attacks, the first or second order effects are readily discernable. However, warfare has changed and a new domain has evolved.\nIn cyberspace, what may appear as a “minor attack” could evolve into something much more destructive to a nation state, taking days or months to cause observable, significant harm. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks, and cyberspace attacks are quite different from the traditional methods of massing forces and building up logistics trains and lines of communication. States can much more easily identify preparation for a kinetic invasion versus a cyberspace onslaught. Asymmetric warfare may require asymmetric application of the law to provide the clarity and enforceability capable of promoting peace. The development of international law related to activities in cyberspace should not be delayed any longer.\nAnd why is finding a legally clear answer so difficult? In his writing, Sharp recognizes the concerns with a strict interpretation of Common Article 2, since such a “rote” application of the Article 2 threshold “intentionally causes military personnel to become belligerents and lawful targets even though they are conducting a peacetime military operation.” Sharp’s concern regarding a strict\n Recall the conclusion of supra note 17 regarding how the asymmetric nature of cyberspace warfare could result in an increasing number of conflicts, all with the potential of having substantially greater effects than traditional low intensity conflicts. This asymmetric nature has created a potential deterrence vacuum, which the law must attempt to fill and states must then enforce.\n SHARP, supra note 4, at 66 (quoting IAN BROWNLEIE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES, 366 (1954)).\n I refer the reader to the two lead-off quotes at the beginning of this article. The lack of clear, enforceable law will only embolden activities in cyberspace and increase international tension and the likelihood of substantial physical damage in addition to the on-going intellectual carnage.\n SHARP, supra note 4, at 65-66.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 77\napplication of Common Article 2 to *jus ad bellum*, conflict management, is certainly justified with regard to the evolution of conventional military activities, such as peacekeeping and peacemaking.\nCyberspace operations, however, do not create the same concerns related to peacekeeping operations. There has been no move to create a U.N. “cyberspace peacekeeping force” to engage in online actions to enforce U.N. resolutions or sanctions, and cyberspace forces are not conducting humanitarian missions. In addition, neither Common Article 2, the U.N. Charter, nor the U.N. definition of aggression are contemporary enough to be strictly applied to activities in cyberspace, since they lack definitions applicable to the unique methods used in cyberspace operations. Nevertheless, the policy objective and low threshold of Common Article 2 provide hope that international law is capable of applying a stricter, definition-based approach to cyberspace attacks. The need for a legally clear answer should help shift the focus from an ambiguous, effects-based approach that relies solely on international law to the development of a definition-based approach capable of consistent application to cyberspace operations that affect other states.\n## E. Weapons are the Key\nThe U.N. General Assembly’s defined aggression to include the use of “any weapons” against another state. The use of such a clearly broad term as “any” logically implies that the use of even minor weapons against a state could be considered an act of aggression, if the circumstances are of “sufficient gravity.” Leaving aside the inevitably ambiguous discussion of events that may be of “sufficient gravity” in the eyes of the U.N. General Assembly, the General Assembly’s inclusion of the use of weapons in its definition of aggression brings the discussion regarding armed attacks in cyberspace back to the initial proposal of analyzing cyberspace attacks using the criminal law model.\nThe criminal law model’s reliance on clear definitions requires us to focus on the causative event, versus emphasizing the effects. For example, a crime is committed when a person fires a gun toward another, regardless of whether the other person is actually struck by a bullet. The minimum crime is some type of assault, likely an aggravated one, in the absence of a legal defense. If the person is struck by the bullet (effect of attack) or other circumstances are developed to indicate a more serious intent, then the chargeable crimes range from aggravated assault to murder. As this example demonstrates, under a criminal law approach, a crime (attack) occurred under all of the factual variations. The increase in harm (effect) only increases the level of punishment the offender may face from society and does not influence whether a crime of some sort occurred.\n\nRegardless of the severity of the crime (attack), societies have long recognized the policy interest in taking measures to respond to and deter crimes. This deterrence objective is a philosophical difference between a criminal law approach and an effects-based approach relying on international law. International law, relying upon an effects-based threshold, is implicated only when an incident’s consequences rise above a certain threshold. Whereas the criminal law model reacts even if there is just an attempt to commit a prohibited act. Thus, a criminal law approach focuses on the actual act and the method used, whether accessing a computer without proper authorization or robbing a bank with a gun. Relying on the criminal law approach allows one to examine the genesis of an attack at an even deeper level. The criminal law approach strives to provide clarity and consistency, allowing all members of a society to know what conduct is prohibited, which also serves the additional objective of deterrence. In the case of defining cyberspace attacks, a consideration of cyberspace weapons is the key to providing such clarity.\nThe use of a weapon of some kind is the true genesis of an attack. In fact, the types of weapons available to a state determine the possible attack methodologies. Thus, studying weapons is also important to understanding the strategy of potential adversaries. However, for the purpose of providing clarity to the issue of armed attacks in cyberspace, the definition of what is a weapon in cyberspace becomes the foundational question to developing a new approach to international law affecting cyberspace operations.\nWhile the U.N. General Assembly used the term “any weapon” and provided no further definition of what constitutes a weapon, one can turn to the law of armed conflict (LOAC) for assistance. Based on the LOAC’s specific guidance regarding conventional tools of war, conventional militaries tend to have a practical understanding of what are lawful and unlawful weapons. For example, exploding bullets and poisonous gas are unlawful weapons. The LOAC focuses, however, almost completely on kinetic weapons.\nDespite its narrow focus on kinetic weapons, the LOAC has nevertheless struggled to define a “weapon,” and there is currently no\n For example, possessing and being able to field deep strike kinetic weapons such as low observable bombers opens up a range of options for a state actor. Likewise, possessing and being willing to use suicide bombers or biological weapons creates a tactical (asymmetric) advantage over adversaries. Thus, being able to conduct operations in cyberspace creates a new line of attack methods.\n Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Oct. 18, 1907, art. 23, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/195?OpenDocument [hereinafter Hague Regulation (IV)]. Article 23 outlaws weapons that cause unnecessary suffering. See also Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, Geneva, June 17, 1925.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 79\naccepted definition under international law. Instead, Article 36 of Protocol I requires a review of any “new weapon, means or method of warfare” to ensure its use would comply with international law. Although the United States has not ratified Protocol I, customary international law requires the review of weapons.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has noted that each state tends to have its own definition of “weapon.” Even within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) there is no standard definition of “weapon.” Thus, each service developed its own definition of weapon, which it uses to determine whether a means or method of warfare requires a legal review in accordance with Article 36 of Protocol I. In the Air Force, paragraph 1 of Air Force Instruction 51-402, Weapons Review, 13 May 1994, defines weapons as “devices designed to kill, injure, or disable people, or to damage or destroy property.” The definition specifically excludes “electronic warfare devices.” The definition also differentiates between effects on people and effects on property, failing to include devices that “disable” property. Meanwhile, the United States Army and Navy each provide a definition of weapon that specifically includes devices that “disable” property. Thus, the Army and Navy definitions appear to be more\n Throughout the remainder of the discussion, the term “weapon” will be used in lieu of the broader term, “weapon, means or method of warfare.”\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONS LAW DIV., OFFICE OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL, DEP’T OF THE AIR FORCE, AIR FORCE OPERATIONS &amp; THE LAW 25, 48 (1st ed. 2002).

THE KEY TO THIS PUZZLE: CYBERSPACE WEAPONS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW DEFINITION-BASED MODEL\n### A. Defining Cyberspace Weapons\nThe criminal law approach and methodology help resolve the issues of ambiguity, enforceability, and attribution for two reasons. First, it provides strong definitions that can withstand judicial scrutiny and allow for fair application to a variety of fact patterns. A nuance of this first strength is that criminal law definitions must also clearly put everyone on notice as to prohibited activities. The second strength is that the criminal law methodology requires the definition of a prohibited act to have some degree of intent, also known as the scienter element. Relying on these strengths, the criminal law approach creates a definition of a cyberspace crime that is clear, flexible, and requires a minimum level of intent. The criminal law methodology will then enable us to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace crime in order to establish the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nAs noted earlier, the European Union’s Convention on Cybercrime is an international treaty intended to create consistency in criminal laws related to internet activities. Unfortunately, the Cybercrime Convention does not offer a definition of malicious logic or cyberspace weapon. Instead, the Cybercrime Convention identifies specific activities states should criminalize. Logically, the reason to prohibit certain activities is to avoid unwanted effects. The criminal law methodology is able to transform unwanted effects into specific definitions and prohibitions, whereas the current approach under international humanitarian law relies on an ambiguous analysis of facts using undefined prohibitions.\nThe intent of the Cybercrime Convention was to set up a basic framework whereby the parties agreed to create their own state criminal codes to address broadly defined prohibited activities. Because the Convention defines prohibited activities broadly, it does not provide the detailed definitions of actual effects in cyberspace necessary to specifically define a cyberspace weapon. Nevertheless, the Convention’s aspirational criminal law definitions of unlawful activity in cyberspace can help identify the international community’s thoughts\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 81\nregarding unlawful cyberspace effects and thus the weapons that cause those effects. By looking at what types of activities the Cybercrime Convention intends to criminalize, it is possible to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nSpecifically, the Cybercrime Convention provides that the parties will adopt laws that criminalize cyberspace crimes such as: unlawful access, unlawful interception, interfering with data or systems, and computer fraud or forgery. Looking at the broad definitions for these offenses under the Cybercrime Convention, terms such as “obtaining,” “damaging,” “deleting,” “deteriorating,” “altering” or “suppressing” data represent a common theme of what happens to electromagnetic data when a cyberspace crime occurs.\nThis criminal law framework parallels the scenarios discussed by many others with regard to armed attacks in cyberspace. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense defines Computer Network Attack as: “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.” Whether a cyberspace crime or a cyberspace attack, the goal is to affect someone else’s data, or use data to affect property.\nThe domain of cyberspace is obviously not as physically transparent as the domains of air and space. If one were to try and “fire” one million volts at a cyberspace target, there are too many information nodes, such as routers and switches, along the internet pathway that would become the unintended recipient of the “electromagnetic missile.” The one million volt “electromagnetic missile” would cause\n See Convention on Cybercrime, supra note 10, at arts. 2-8.\n Id. arts. 4, 5. Article 4 provides:\nData interference: 1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data without right. 2. A Party may reserve the right to require that the conduct described in paragraph 1 result in serious harm.\nArticle 5 provides:\nSystem interference: Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.\n JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUB. 1-02, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS 113 (17 Mar. 2009) [hereinafter JP 1-02].\n\ncollateral damage to those nodes and would be worn down long before it reached its intended target. Cyberspace attacks, just like criminal hacks, are designed to affect electromagnetic data in various ways, which then impact the adversary's cyberspace to create an operational advantage for the attacker. Thus, the basic legal framework of the Cybercrime Convention is beneficial in the context of military operations in cyberspace.\nAlthough the Cybercrime Convention does not provide definitions of key terms such as \"damaging\" or \"altering,\" the Cybercrime Convention points us to the criminal codes of party states, such as the United States, to specifically define the actus reus. The criminal code of the United States is considered for several reasons: the United States invented the internet; the United States is arguably the largest user of cyberspace; the United States is a leading prosecutor of cyberspace crimes; and many nations work with the United States to solve cyberspace crimes.\nSection 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes intentionally causing damage to a protected computer.[42] Section 1030 is often used by U.S. Attorneys to prosecute persons who steal or corrupt data located on computer systems and persons who engage in denial of service attacks. Section 1030 defines \"damage\" as \"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.\" This definition of \"damage\" recognizes the reality of what happens during a criminal hack or a cyberspace attack: \"damage\" in cyberspace does not require smashing, burning, or blowing things up. The U.S. Code provides a clear, judicially accepted and internationally recognized definition of damage in the cyberspace realm. By borrowing from this definition, it is possible to logically develop a definition of a cyberspace weapon, the key to the puzzle.[43]\nFrom the above, we see that in its most simple terms, the definition of a weapon is \"something that causes damage.\" Applying the definition of damage from Section 1030, I propose the following definition of a cyberspace weapon: Any capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.[44] Although the proposed definition uses the term\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n\n## B. Applying the Definition of a Cyberspace Weapon\nNow that we have defined cyberspace weapon, the remaining challenge is to determine whether the proposed definition works within the context of cyberspace operations and within the current limits of international law. While the first instances of negative code may not have been written with the intent of harming a computer, today the story is quite different. Today, the development of computer code that negatively impacts an information system has evolved and spread like an advanced, persistent plague. The tools of the modern hacker, whether criminal, military, terrorist, geek, or spy, are broadly referred to as malicious logic. While malicious logic can take many forms, the key question for our purposes is: “At what point does malicious logic become a cyberspace weapon, the use of which constitutes an armed attack under international law?” The first part of the question focuses not on the end result but on the “tool” used in cyberspace and whether that tool is a “weapon.” The second part of the question will focus on the weapon’s use in cyberspace.\nFirst, one must consider whether particular cyberspace “tools” constitute weapons under international law. The ICRC Commentary on Article 35 of Additional Protocol I states: “The words ‘methods and means’ include weapons in the widest sense, as well as the way in which they are used.” Furthermore, the ICRC Guide on New Weapons expounds on the above commentary provision by noting that the legal\n Again, recall that while the services’ definitions of weapon all used the term “disable,” JP 1-02, supra note 41, uses the term “degrade” when describing Computer Network Attack.\n Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1402 (for art. 35). Article 35 provides overarching guidance regarding the means and methods of warfare and reads:\nBasic rules - 1. In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. 2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. 3. It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.\nProtocol I, supra note 19, at art. 35.\n\nreview requirements of Article 36 apply even to non-lethal weapons based on “the ways in which these weapons are to be used pursuant to military doctrine, tactics, rules of engagement, operating procedures and countermeasures” and also applies to all acquired weapons, whether procured based on military specifications or “off-the shelf.”47 Both the Commentary and the ICRC guide conclude that the analysis regarding whether a weapon is lawful or unlawful should be focused on the weapon’s “normal or expected use.”48\nNext, one must analyze how the proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon can be applied in the real-world context of two recent “cyberspace attacks” in Estonia and Georgia. Considering the realities of these two events, does the proposed definition provide sufficient clarity for use in international law?\nThe cyberspace event in April and May of 2007 in Estonia involved a number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) actions against the networks for the two largest banks, effectively severing all internet communications for two hours and causing partial interruptions thereafter.49 The event also included acts against an Estonian government internet service provider that “disrupted government communications for at least a short period of time.”50 Lastly, the web page for the Estonian Prime Minister was “defaced,” manipulating it to show an alleged apology for moving a Soviet World War II memorial.51 Clearly, the event in Estonia resulted in reduced availability and impaired the integrity of the information located on computer systems in Estonia. Applying the attacker’s methods to the proposed definition, it is clear these methods constituted “cyberspace weapons.”\nThe cyberspace event that occurred in July and August of 2008 in Georgia results in a similar conclusion. Again, a DDoS event targeted the website of the Georgian President, making it unavailable for 24 hours. Attackers also defaced the website with pictures of Adolf Hitler next to the image of the Georgian President, and, using malicious logic, caused websites for other government agencies to lose connectivity.52 Here again, the methods used by cyberspace attackers in Georgia caused a loss of access and impaired the integrity of the data. Consequently, it is appropriate to label these methods as “cyberspace weapons.” The proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon therefore\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 85\n\nprovides the degree of clarity to move the discussion forward to defining a cyberspace attack.\n## C. When is the Use of a Cyberspace Weapon a Cyberspace Attack?\nAcknowledging that cyberspace weapons were used in the events in Estonia and Georgia does not answer the ultimate question of whether the acts should be considered armed attacks under international law? Here again, the temptation is to return to an effects-based analysis to answer the question. However, as noted at the beginning of this article, previous attempts to answer the question using such an analysis provide ambiguous answers at best. Instead, by applying a definition-based approach, much like the criminal law does, there is a higher likelihood of reaching a clear answer. Therefore, in order to determine when the use of a cyberspace weapon constitutes an “armed attack” under international law, one must look to how the cyberspace weapon is used rather than its effects.\nThis question of how a weapon is used is the key transitional point in this analytical approach and borrows substantially from the criminal law. For example, a gun can either be a weapon used to kill people or a weapon used to assist a hunter in gathering food. The intent of the user remains the primary issue under the criminal law. Using this criminal law approach will enable conversion of the above question into a definition applicable to the international law arena.\nTo prove an offense under the criminal law, almost all crimes require proof of *mens rea*, the idea of a criminal intent or purpose. Specifically, most crimes require proof of either specific or general intent or knowledge. The most difficult *mens rea* to prove is specific intent, whereas knowledge is much more easily inferred from the circumstances. Considering history and the unwillingness of state actors to admit their actual intent, proving the specific or general intent of a state actor is very difficult when relying on circumstantial evidence, and would therefore result in an unenforceable definition beneficial only to academic discussions.\nTherefore, because proof of knowledge is easier to prove than either a specific or general *mens rea*, it will lead to a more enforceable standard and place a higher level of responsibility on states. Even though knowledge is a lower threshold than specific or general intent, it is nevertheless a common and accepted *mens rea* requirement under criminal law. Still, the question remains, knowledge of what? As will be discussed further below, state actors have a responsibility, as sovereigns with power and control, to conduct their affairs with due regard for their international legal obligations when they have knowledge of activities within their legal or physical boundaries. Hence, it is appropriate to consider the following definition of a\n\n\"cyberspace attack\": A cyberspace attack occurs when a state knowingly uses or knowingly acquiesces to an entity under its legal control or within its territory using a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state.\nThe proposed definition of cyberspace attack essentially imposes additional responsibility under international law when a state knowingly allows a person or entity to use a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state. Under the unique circumstances of cyberspace, such a clear definition establishes the increased degree of responsibility necessary to promote international peace and help deter the myriad of adverse activities in cyberspace. Consider the actions of one rogue group if they were to successfully conduct a cyberspace attack against the critical infrastructure of another state. Regardless of the group's motives, whether nationalistic, ideological, or criminal, causing the death of several hundred people and millions of dollars worth of property damage is a scenario that international law must evolve to address and deter. Still, if the state is completely unaware of a rogue element's activities, then it seems appropriate not to impart responsibility and accountability under international law.\nHowever, what if the state that can legally control the rogue element knew that the element was about to or was currently engaging in a cyberspace attack against persons or property in the victim state? The responsible state could, if necessary, disrupt all communications originating from the rogue element or emanating from the state until it could locate and arrest the attackers for violating their domestic laws. The definition of a cyberspace attack, although similar to the definition of a cyberspace crime, is not intended to hold states responsible for the nefarious efforts of criminals, unless the state is aware of the criminal's efforts and knowingly acquiesces to the use of a cyberspace weapon. The objective is to develop a legal framework that inspires states to cooperate to eliminate the harmful use of cyberspace—to create deterrence.\nWithout the proposed legal framework, why should a state try to stop an impending cyberspace attack against another state? Under current state practice, if the victim state is an \"ally,\" then the responsible, \"host\" state will likely feel much more compelled to take positive steps to stop the attack. For example, if a hacker in the United Kingdom was conducting a cyberspace attack against the Hoover Dam in the United States, U.K. security and law enforcement officials would almost certainly act with all diligence to stop the attack and arrest the perpetrators, and would likely allow their extradition to the United States.[53] However, how many cyberspace events against entities in the\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n\nSome argue that international law may not be inclined to place such a clear responsibility on states for acquiescing to uses of cyberspace weapons, unless they caused effects equivalent to more traditional armed attacks. However, the United Nations has issued resolutions that appear to place a higher burden on states to refrain from acquiescing to certain acts committed from their territory against other states. For example, a General Assembly Resolution in 1970, number 2625, discussed acquiescence and said that states have a duty to refrain from acquiescing or tolerating actions from within its territory that cause civil strife in the other state. More recently, the United Nations\nof U.S. military servers in 2001 and 2002.

Res. 2625, U.N. GAOR, 25th Sess. (Oct. 24, 1970). The key excerpts from the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among states in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations are:\nEvery State has a duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting, or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force . . .\nAlso, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State. . .\nStates have the duty to co-operate with one another, irrespective of the differences in their political, economic and social systems, in the various spheres of international relations, in order to maintain international peace and security . . .\nAll states enjoy sovereign equality. They have equal rights and duties . . .\nThe principles of the Charter which are embodied in this Declaration constitute basic principles of international law . . .\n\nSecurity Council issued Resolution 1373 on September 28, 2001, which reaffirmed the key principles in Resolution 2625. Resolution 1373 decided under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that all states shall take the necessary steps to prevent terrorist acts, to prevent terrorists from using their territories for terrorist purposes, and to provide early warning to other states.\nAlthough not directly on point with all scenarios of cyberspace attack, some cyberspace attacks could fit within the resolutions’ already accepted prohibitions related to harboring terrorists, preventing use of territory by terrorists, and acquiescing to those who cause civil strife. The proposed definition of armed attack in cyberspace would really only increase the degree of state responsibility for non-state actors by a small amount. In light of the growing concern related to the impact of non-state actors on international peace, and considering the asymmetric and potentially dangerous attributes of cyberspace, such an increase in state responsibility is not unreasonable.\nThe strength of the proposed definition of cyberspace attack is that it would place a clear responsibility on all states. All states would know what international law requires and non-state actors would know that their actions could be considered armed attacks. Although clear and strict in comparison to the current approach, the proposed legal threshold is not improperly low. It has a reasonable *mens rea* requirement, to wit: the host state must have knowledge of the impending or ongoing use of a cyberspace weapon. Because the proposed definition requires knowing acquiescence, a state can claim the defense of impossibility. For example, the host state may have no knowledge of an ongoing cyberspace attack because the rogue element first hacked into and gained control of the entire host state’s communications infrastructure. Still, once the host state became aware of the intended location of the attack, it would then be responsible to at least communicate that information to the victim state and continue to take reasonable measures to stop or impede the attack and cooperate with the victim state.\nThe unique attributes of cyberspace, such as its speed and lack of physical borders, are key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory when they do not take reasonable measures to stop the attack and warn the victim state. One cannot overemphasize the potency of the asymmetric capabilities of cyberspace in comparison to any other war-fighting domain in the world’s history, a capability that enables almost any person to engage in actions with\n S.C. Res. 1373, U.N. SCOR, 4385th mtg., U.N. Doc.

Res. 56/1, U.N. GAOR, 56th Sess., U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/1 (Sept. 12, 2001).\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 89\nlethal and costly effects. Therefore, another difference between the proposed definition and current requirements under international law is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack does not include a requirement that the attack involve the armed forces of the aggressor, as the commentary to Common Article 2 requires and the U.N. definition of aggression implies. However, the U.N. definition of aggression clearly includes mercenaries and irregulars. Once more, considering the asymmetric nature of cyberspace, requiring a cyberspace attack to involve the armed forces or mercenaries of the aggressor would create a legal hole big enough for hundreds of thugs and brigands to \"attack\" the victim state. In consideration of the incredible amount of physical or information damage that non-state actors can cause in cyberspace, knowing acquiescence to such attacks is the correct standard for imposing state responsibility under international law.\nBut, is it fair to impose such strict accountability on the use of cyberspace, when some cyberspace attributes, such as ease of access and use, are similar to those of global commons? For example, some may argue that the proposed definition is contrary to Article 8 of the Hague Regulation (V).[57] Article 8 provides that “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” It is accepted that many cyberspace communications occur over “telephone cables” and similar telecommunications infrastructure. Thus, the language of Article 8 is applicable to cyberspace operations. Article 8 clearly does not place a duty on a neutral power to forbid or restrict belligerents from using their communications infrastructure. In fact, Article 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) states that any restrictive measures implemented by a neutral power must be equally applied to “both belligerents.” Article 8’s language, therefore, appears to contradict the proposed definition.\nAlternatively, one could argue that the proposed definition of cyberspace attack does not conflict with Article 8, because the proposed definition creates a transitional status for a state. Once a state becomes aware of a cyberspace attack originating from its territory and targeting another state, it is no longer a \"neutral power\" and now must act to stop the attack or become a de facto \"belligerent.\" The idea of a state transitioning between being a neutral power and a belligerent may be too tenuous for realistic application in international law. In the alternative, states could choose, when adopting the proposed definition\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nof cyberspace attack, to explicitly state that Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) no longer apply to cyberspace.\nGoing back to the Estonia and Georgia events, most media attributed the use of cyberspace weapons to Russian internet addresses. Despite early and widespread media attribution to Russia, the attacks continued, strongly implying that Russia was directly responsible for the attacks. Apparently, Russian law enforcement and security services made no effort to stop the cyberspace attacks. Russia was certainly on notice that the world community believed the cyberspace attacks were originating from within its borders. While circumstantial evidence clearly indicated that Russia knowingly acquiesced to these attacks, there was no direct evidence. Reviewing the circumstantial evidence under the proposed definition indicates that Russia violated international law and the victim states had the right of self-defense. However, relying on circumstantial evidence is not something the international community and international law are generally comfortable doing.\nThis lack of direct evidence is indicative of the attribution problem currently hindering all investigations of actions in cyberspace. Investigators of domestic cyberspace crimes meticulously use forensic tools to identify which specific internet protocol (IP) address is responsible for a cyberspace crime and then interview the suspect to determine their level of knowledge or intent. Unfortunately, overseas investigations can only be accomplished if there is cooperation between the involved states. When a foreign state does not provide equal access to forensic evidence and suspects, the attribution barrier obstructs the inquiry and protects the “attacker.” Such actions do not promote peace or resolve conflict.\nThe effects-based model would likely conclude that the Estonia and Georgia attacks were not severe enough to be considered armed attacks or even an unlawful use of force. There were no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack. The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy. Reviewing the international reaction after the fact, there were no declarations by the international\n Arthur Bright, *Estonia accuses Russia of ‘cyberattack,’* CHRISTIAN SCI.

Charter or that they created de facto hostilities under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions. Estonia chose not to consider them armed attacks, while the Georgia situation simultaneously devolved into a kinetic conflict. What option did Estonia really have? If Estonia felt it had sufficient attribution, Estonia could have considered the acts armed attacks, creating a de facto state of hostilities and requested the assistance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under the NATO Treaty’s collective self-defense provision. Estonia could have waited for NATO to risk war with Russia. Estonia could also have responded in self-defense with conventional, kinetic forces, since they did not have any “cyberspace forces.” The potential result could have been a strong conventional response from Russia, including occupation of Estonia. Again, the “bully dilemma” reared its head. This prompts the question, is it fair to rely on a 60 year-old conventional model that gives such weight to state practice when the kinetic forces and available cyberspace capabilities are so disproportionate?\nIndeed, continued reliance on such a model could lead “minor” states to develop cyberspace forces in an effort to achieve an asymmetric advantage over states with much larger kinetic capabilities, leading to a cyberspace arms race and possibly more conflicts. As the Estonia and Georgia events demonstrate, when a state knowingly chooses to not assist a victim state or hold responsible those who use cyberspace weapons against other states, international law should view that state as a transgressor.\nThat is what the proposed definition of cyberspace attack intends to do. The proposed definition will have a positive impact on international law and conflict management, because it will clearly place\n North Atlantic Treaty art. 5, Apr. 4, 1949, 63 Stat. 2241, 34 U.N.T.S. 243. Article 5 states:\nThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.\n\nresponsibility on all states to not engage in cyberspace attacks and to police and secure their cyberspace “borders.” Essentially, everyone will know a cyberspace attack when they see it, and everyone will know that any state that conducts or permits such an attack could suffer self-defense actions and international sanctions. The end result would hopefully be a dramatic decrease in cyberspace events of foreign origin, which would also reduce the likelihood of a cyberspace “arms race” and cause the de-escalation of low intensity conflicts in cyberspace.\n## D. Flies in the Ointment: Attribution and Espionage\nAs referenced above, an effects-based approach magnifies the attribution problem, because it requires attribution of intentional direct participation or support by the state actor, versus knowing acquiescence. The difficulty of attribution in cyberspace prevents the evolution of realistic customary norms. No state actor can realistically consider the full spectrum of actions, because they do not know who acted against them or why. In addition, the difficulty in comprehending the full severity of the “attack,” because of the delayed effects of cyberspace weapons, compounds the difficulty in determining an appropriate response.\nUnlike the effects-based approach, the proposed definition does not require determining who controlled or supported the activity, the aggressor’s intent, or the full magnitude of the attack. Using the\n The concept of boundaries and sovereignty in cyberspace is also a topic of discussion amongst academics and practitioners. Although there is no clear definition and enforcement of boundaries in cyberspace, all states should recognize that electronic communications of all types originate in one state and can terminate (and have effects) in another state. Therefore, a state can monitor communications occurring inside its geographic borders. For example, the NSA under the Terrorist Surveillance Program was able to monitor communications where one party was located “outside” the United States. White House Press Briefing, Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales &amp; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, Principal Deputy Dir. of Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2005/intell-051219-dni01.htm. The concept of cyberspace borders has even been expanded to include discussions of a cyberspace Monroe Doctrine with regard to cyberspace infrastructure associated to the United States. See Reviewing the Federal Cybersecurity Mission: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Homeland Sec., Sub-Comm. on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, &amp; Sci. &amp; Tech., 110th Cong. (2009) (statement of Mary Ann Davidson, Oracle Security Officer), available at http://homeland.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20090310143850-78976.pdf.\n Relying on a heuristic analysis of past actions is somewhat similar to how scientists conduct scientific experiments and then analyze the results. In order for scientific experiments and their results to be reliable, external factors must be eliminated or controlled, and all other factors must be accurately known. The lack of attribution makes it impossible to accurately complete a heuristic analysis, since three of the most important factors, identity, intent, and full severity of attack, will rarely be known without it.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 93\ndefinitional approach, only two questions need to be resolved. First, was a cyberspace weapon used against the property or persons of a state? Second, did a foreign state knowingly allow an entity under its legal control to use the cyberspace weapon against the victim?\nEven with the proposed definitions and a two element test, one of the oldest arts, espionage, can still take advantage of the attribution difficulties in cyberspace. Espionage has long been recognized as essential to the success of states and their militaries. While a criminal offense in virtually every nation state, espionage is not a violation of the law of war and was first recognized in the Lieber Code in 1863. It was subsequently codified in the 1907 Hague Regulations and in Protocol I. Acts deemed to be espionage will not trigger a state’s right to self-defense, because espionage does not violate international law. Based on the definitions from the various documents considered part of customary international law, the consistent requirement for espionage is that a member of the armed forces gathers or attempts to gather information under false pretenses or while not wearing their uniform.\nSuch a definition does not perfectly transfer over to espionage in cyberspace. Whether the person at the other computer terminal is wearing his uniform is irrelevant to attributing his identity and intent in cyberspace. Still, a cyberspace spy will intrinsically gain access to the information or data under false pretenses. The average cyberspace intruder does not disclose his identity nor does he come to the main web page and ask the webmaster for permission. Instead, he exploits vulnerabilities in software coding that allow him to gain unauthorized access, which is essentially under false pretenses as discussed in Article\n Sun Tzu stated: “So, as for enlightened lords or distinguished commanders, the reason they can overcome the adversary when action is taken and achieve unparalleled success is prescience. Prescience cannot be gained from ghost or gods . . . . It must be gained from what is learned by men.” SUN TZU, SUN TZU: THE NEW TRANSLATION 112 (J. H. Huang trans. 1993).\n FRANCIS LIEBER, INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIELD, ART. 88 (Apr. 24, 1863), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/110?OpenDocument [hereinafter LIEBER CODE]. Article 88 defines a spy as: “a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy.”\n Article 29 of Hague Regulation (IV), supra note 33, defines a spy thus:\n[A]cting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information, are not considered spies.\nArticle 46 of Protocol I, supra note 19, provides that a member of the armed forces shall not be considered a spy “unless he does so through an act of false pretences or deliberately in a clandestine manner.”\n\nIt is certainly possible for cyberspace spies to gain access to information and copy or degrade the data without the use of a cyberspace weapon. However, the tension between lawful espionage and armed attack in cyberspace occurs when a spy uses a cyberspace weapon to access or steal information. If a traditional spy uses a weapon, such as a pistol, the act is viewed as a criminal act, versus an armed attack. Should the same be true of a cyberspace spy who hacks into a system by using a cyberspace weapon? Applying the proposed definition of cyberspace attack, the use of a cyberspace weapon while committing espionage in or through cyberspace could be interpreted as a cyberspace attack and result in self-defense actions.\nThe only way to resolve the tension between cyberspace espionage and cyberspace attack is to determine whether the cyberspace intruder intends solely to copy and then steal the data or information. Again, this dilemma adds a layer of complexity to the attribution issue by now requiring a determination of the actor’s full intent, creating an untenable situation for the victim state. Given that actions happen so fast in cyberspace, a spy or attacker could move “in and out” before a victim state could do any more than determine the foreign internet protocol (IP) address of the intruder. A full damage assessment, identifying what happened to the victim computer system could take hours to weeks. While some cyberspace attacks may be obvious, many will not be, as the beauty of cyberspace warfare is the ability to create second and third order effects, which are difficult to identify in advance.\nThe attribution issue reaches a pinnacle of complexity when trying to resolve events between espionage and cyberspace attacks. Therefore, today, a victim state is left with three choices: (1) continue to operate in the current international system of subjective analysis and inconsistent past responses while ineffectively trying to gather very detailed attribution information; (2) develop a robust cyberspace force capable of conducting cyberspace attacks, cyberspace espionage, and able to “hack back” to develop reasonably detailed attribution information; (3) or issue an ultimatum to the international community, hoping that others will agree, which informs all other states that any activity in that state’s territory that is determined to satisfy the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack will justify self-defense actions by the victim state.\n Phishing or spear phishing emails target known users on a network and always provide a false reason for the recipient to provide key information or click on a hyperlink that will then redirect the user to another web page where malicious code, read weapon, will be surreptitiously installed on the user’s computer.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 95\nThe difficulty with resolving the espionage issue is that under the first option a state remains vulnerable to many forms of cyberspace attack while attempting to resolve whether the event is an act of espionage or cyberspace attack and waiting for the international community to subjectively analyze the evidence. In addition, the evidence to satisfy the international community would likely include the elusive proof of actual intent to harm the victim state. Adversarial states could choose to take advantage of this slow analysis and decision loop, achieving paralysis by analysis, and methodically weaken a state with what appears to be cyberspace espionage but is in fact a number of cyberspace attacks aimed at creating third order effects. Lastly, it appears that states are not willingly sharing the details of their cyberspace activities with others, which still leaves a void of necessary information to conduct the required heuristic analysis to develop the law under the current framework.\nThe second option will help the state protect itself from adversarial activities in cyberspace and possibly lead to attributable information. In spite of this benefit, the potential of a cyberspace arms race increases. This development could lead to an increase in low scale cyberspace conflicts and ultimately result in an adversary conducting a second or third order cyberspace attack inflicting massive casualties or property damage.67 The continued development of cyberspace capabilities appears to be the current direction of the leading states, such as China, Russia, and the United States. States certainly cannot be faulted for taking such an approach, as the current international legal scheme offers them very little protection yet many opportunities to exploit the cyberspace of other states. Therefore, the race for dominance in cyberspace has begun and may soon grow out of control.\nThe second option also has some parallels to the approach that states took when nuclear tensions were high during the Cold War. The superpowers recognized that conventional methodologies could not be applied to the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). States recognized that Article 51’s right of self-defense limited them to proportional actions. However, due to the overwhelming effect and fairly rapid speed of any nuclear attack, states were doctrinally prepared to respond in full at the first indication of even a limited attack, since they recognized that they could not afford to wait and see how many warheads or which locations the adversary’s warheads hit and how much damage they caused. Superpowers projected that they were capable, prepared, and willing to respond to even a limited, targeted nuclear first-strike with a full-scale response.\n\nHistorically, one can see how nation states adopted their practice in light of the dramatic increase in speed and lethality of nuclear attacks using ICBM’s compared to the previous conventional method of warfare, circa World War II. While many decried the age of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and called it “mad,” one cannot dispute that during that time period, even though there was a nuclear arms race, no nuclear weapons were used. Mad or not, MAD was an effective method of deterrence. There are a number of parallels between the use of ICBMs and cyberspace operations: cyberspace attacks have the potential for incredible lethality; much greater speed than previous weapons; and the actual severity of the threat, the intent, and the identity of the actor are usually too difficult to determine in sufficient time to respond appropriately before the damage is done.\nHowever, there is one crucial difference between today’s option two situation (developing a robust cyberspace force and “hacking back”) and the deterrence model of MAD during the Cold War. Currently, it does not appear that a substantial number of states are willing to make a declaration of mutually assured destruction through cyberspace and simultaneously abstain from conducting cyberspace operations. Without such declarations and cessation of the use of cyberspace weapons, the parallels with the Cold War nuclear deterrence model end. Pragmatically, states do not feel the impetus to consider such an approach. There has been no mass disaster or 9-11 type “wake-up call” in cyberspace, and, as noted above, a number of states likely believe they can “win” in cyberspace. Therefore, applying the nuclear deterrence model to cyberspace operations is not practical. Unfortunately, history has shown that society rarely chooses to collectively legislate against harm until after it suffers the consequences.\nStill, there is one historical example where society chose to proactively legislate and limit the weaponization of a domain, much like option three. The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space. The third option can perhaps draw strength from the efforts to limit the militarization of space, recognizing cyberspace as a sort of international commons similar to outer space. Each state, relying on the proposed definitions, would still retain its sovereignty and control of cyberspace infrastructure located within its borders. The implementation of the proposed definitions would recognize that the use of cyberspace is intended for peace-promoting purposes and the use of weapons in cyberspace, even for espionage purposes, will not be accepted. Providing states the right of self-defense using the lower, clear threshold of the proposed\n Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Jan. 27, 1967, 6 I.L.M. 386, available at http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 97\ndefinitions will hopefully inspire states to abstain from cyberspace espionage and attacks and cooperate to protect the peaceful use of cyberspace.\n## IV. APPLYING THE DEFINITIONS AND EXERCISING SELF-DEFENSE IN CYBERSPACE\nIn order to further understand how option three’s (issuing an ultimatum that the state could respond in self-defense to cyberspace attacks) use of the proposed definitions will promote peace and reduce the improper use of cyberspace, it is helpful to explore how states could act in response to a cyberspace attack. The doctrine of self-defense relies on two principles: necessity and proportionality. Necessity involves whether effective peaceful means of resolution exist; the nature of the aggression, each party’s objectives, and the likelihood of effective intervention by the international community. Proportionality requires limiting the magnitude, scope, and duration of the force used in response to that which is reasonably necessary to counter the threat or attack. The timing of a self-defense action is closely related to the factor of necessity and is a debated issue. A delayed response weakens a state’s claim of necessity to defend itself. While an early response in anticipation of attack also draws questions as to the certainty of need for the self-defense action.\nLooking at necessity and the timing of self-defense actions in cyberspace, the unique qualities of cyberspace again highlight the importance of moving toward a deterrence model. Once a state suffers what it believes to be an armed attack in or through cyberspace, it can arguably satisfy the above requirements of necessity to defend itself. Unfortunately, in cyberspace, there will likely not be sufficient time to consider peaceful resolution of the matter, fully understand the nature of the attack or the intended results, or to mobilize international peacekeeping forces. Thus, the more difficult question related to necessity is how appropriate is anticipatory self-defense in cyberspace?\nAnticipatory self-defense “justifies use of force in anticipation of an ‘imminent’ armed attack.” Basically, a state need not wait to receive the aggressor’s attack and can instead act in self-defense to “repel” the attack. The doctrine “finds it roots in the 1837 Caroline case and subsequent correspondence between then-U.S. Secretary of\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK 4 (2007) [hereinafter U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK]; see also YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION AND SELF-DEFENCE (4th ed. 2005).\n U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 69.\n Id. at 6.\n Id.\n\nState Daniel Webster and his British Foreign Office counterpart Lord Ashburton.\"73 Secretary Webster informed Lord Ashburton that a state can act in self-defense when the circumstances are \"instantaneous, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation.\"74 The attributes of cyberspace, especially speed and lethality, seem quite similar to Secretary Webster's factors. Essentially, if a state is fortunate enough to develop information about a developing or planned cyberspace attack against it, the attributes of cyberspace may compel a state to act in its best interest and exercise anticipatory self-defense.\nThe follow-on question involves what a state can do in self-defense, i.e. how is the principle of proportional response applied in and through cyberspace? In cyberspace, there may be a number of ways to technically counter an attack. A state could disconnect itself from cyberspace. However, such a response seems disproportionately burdensome on the victim state and could cause other forms of harm internally. The victim state could quickly counter with anti-virus measures, although such efforts are always a game of \"catch-up.\" The victim state could respond by disconnecting all cyberspace connections with the aggressor state. However, this will only work as long as the aggressor state chooses not to attack through another state. Moreover, such actions require attribution.\nBecause a state needs to know against which state to exercise self-defense, developing reliable attribution represents another difficulty with applying age-old laws and methods to cyberspace. Given that a cyberspace attack comes from another country and could involve communications \"hopping\" through several other countries, it is nearly impossible for a state to develop attribution without first violating the cyberspace infrastructure and jurisdiction of other states. Currently, to avoid violating another state's cyberspace, states send requests for assistance to cooperating states. The victim state requests help in developing information about the IP address in question and also requests monitoring of that IP address, allowing the state to \"hop back\" to the next IP address, and then request more help. This \"hopping back\" process can be painful and long, leaving the victim state vulnerable. However, the traditional police doctrine of hot pursuit is expanding in international law. Under customary international law, ships and planes can follow offending vessels in hot pursuit up to another state's territorial sea or airspace.75 However, the European Union has adopted the Schengen Agreement that permits law enforcement officials to cross state borders when pursuing a criminal suspected of certain serious\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 99\n\noffenses The agreement provides that the pursuing officers will cease their pursuit upon request of the other state, however, the pursuing officers can request that the other state arrest the suspect.\nExtending the principles of the Schengen Agreement to the domain of cyberspace seems logical, because attacks in cyberspace are analogous to serious criminal offenses. Permitting hot pursuit is consistent with the proposed definition’s efforts to deter states from knowingly acquiescing to cyberspace attacks. Witting host states will find it much harder to hide in the shadow of attribution. Providing victim states with a legal “hot pursuit” capability, including proper coordination mechanisms, will be invaluable to promoting cooperation, reducing crime, and deterring attacks in and through cyberspace.\nWith the ability to more quickly attribute attacks, a state would then have other options to consider under the principle of proportionate response. The victim state could consider firing back in self-defense with a cyberspace weapon at the actual computer(s) used to attack it. This can be reasonably effective if a limited number of computers are involved. However, a victim state will likely remain concerned, due to its limited ability to determine whether more attacks or attacks of increasing severity will follow the initial round of attacks. This challenge may lead a state to consider more serious measures, such as responding with a self-defense attack that involves disrupting a substantial portion of the witting host state’s cyberspace. However, the collateral damage from such a self-defense action could be substantial. The questions of necessity and anticipatory self-defense also affect the proportionality decision. Moreover, nothing prohibits states from defending against a cyberspace attack by using kinetic weapons, such as striking a key communication node with a cruise missile or damaging a state’s communication satellite(s). The hypotheticals and the potential for conflict abound. Thus, the unique nature of cyberspace and the inability to clearly apply current international laws, norms, and practices make resolution of conflict extremely difficult, and should inspire states to seek a framework of cooperation and deterrence, such as the one I advocate in this article.\n\n# V. LOOKING FORWARD AND CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\nThe definitions proposed in this article provide a framework for consistency and an opportunity to level the playing field of international law. Today, states can either choose to continue with the status quo, or, recognizing the benefits of the peaceful use of cyberspace, embrace the need for clear definitions of cyberspace weapon and cyberspace attack. Embracing the definitions I propose would, at most, have a moderate impact on how international affairs are conducted today. The Schengen Agreement and the E.U. Convention on Cybercrime serve as models to build a framework of cooperation to promote peace and reduce crime. States would need to establish cyberspace communications centers, whereby each state would agree to pass information to another state as soon as it became aware of a cyberspace attack against a victim state, but is currently unable to halt the attack from affecting the victim state. The centers would also coordinate the hot pursuit issues related to developing attribution.\nThose states that choose not to adopt the proposed legal definitions and methods of cooperation would do so knowing that their actions or inaction could be viewed as a cyberspace attack. Each state would still continue to exercise its right of self-defense. Meanwhile, the international community could apply the new legal standard when considering whether to apply sanctions. The end result is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack with cooperative application under international law could make a powerful form of asymmetric warfare untenable before it develops into an arms race that leads to increased conflicts and harms people and property.\nWhen our predecessors developed the law of conflict management it is doubtful anyone could foresee the day when a state could attack another state simply by manipulating electronic data. Even the futuristic Buck Rogers and lasers still had visible, kinetic-like effects. Today, one must recognize that the lack of specific definitions for “weapon” and “armed attack” create an untenable vacuum in the evolving domain of cyberspace. So far, only the criminal law has provided thorough definitions in an attempt to keep pace with the development of nefarious tools in cyberspace. The criminal law methodology provides a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt such definitions to the various uses of prohibited cyberspace tools. The field of international law requires similar flexibility. This article attempted to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon from the criminal law’s efforts to specifically define the acts caused by cyberspace criminals. The\n A state could of course provide the information to the potential victim state, even if they were able to halt the attack before it caused harm. This extra level of cooperation would assist all states in developing their capabilities to detect potential cyberspace attacks.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 101\ncriminal law methodology facilitated the development of a definition of a cyberspace attack. By applying the current international law framework to the proposed definition of an armed attack in cyberspace, this article highlighted how such a definition could lead to parity in cyberspace and thereby promote peace through deterrence."

INTRODUCTION\nChange has come and gone. While academics have been discussing methods to define the use of force in cyberspace, governments and policy makers may have missed an opportunity to shape the law of war. Just like a child “pinching” a peppermint from the candy store while the owner was not looking, someone may have successfully launched two cyberspace attacks, and no one called either one an unlawful use of force or armed attack. Did a state actor set a precedent that could become part of customary international law?\nEvery day there are new stories and developments about the increasing connectivity of people around the world spurred by the continued fast pace of technological developments in the computer and communications industries. Military applications of cyberspace are also rapidly evolving, moving the domain of cyberspace to the front lines of conflicts. But, the legal frameworks that regulate war or armed conflict are lagging far behind the technological changes that have already occurred. Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light. Unfortunately, law, especially international law, failed to keep pace with the new applications of existing technologies.³ On the criminal front, law enforcement agencies are swamped with allegations ranging from identity theft to theft of corporate data, while armed with only a marginally effective process to investigate, extradite, and prosecute international cyberspace criminals. However, the conduct of military operations in and through cyberspace, with potentially greater global implications, is bypassing the currently inadequate mire of international law. What if international law could provide a framework capable of enabling deterrence in cyberspace?\n¹ U.S.-CHINA ECON. &amp; SEC.

The unique qualities of operations in cyberspace will make this the most difficult domain in which to resolve international disputes and conflict. In this article, I intend to offer a new methodology for determining armed attacks in cyberspace by using existing criminal law legal tools. Specifically, this methodology will borrow from the criminal law’s definitions of cyberspace crimes, in order to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon. More importantly, by defining cyberspace weapon, this methodology will enable the international community to define what constitutes a cyberspace attack. Providing the legal framework for a definition of cyberspace attack, such as the new methodology outlined in this article, will serve to reduce the potential for conflict in cyberspace.\nThe article will first examine cyberspace and how current approaches have attempted to apply international law to armed attacks in cyberspace. Looking through the lens of current international laws will highlight how the unique attributes of cyberspace could increase the likelihood of international conflict. The article will identify how the failure of international law to define armed attacks and weapons further exacerbates this problem. The article will then transition from current international laws to examine whether current criminal law definitions and methodologies can fill the gap and provide realistic definitions of weapons and armed attacks in cyberspace. Lastly, the article will put these proposed definitions to the test against the most challenging aspects of cyberspace: attribution and espionage.\n⁴ See, e.g., Michael N.

APPLYING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBERSPACE ATTACKS: FALLING SHORT WITHOUT DEFINITIONS\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nFor the purposes of this article, I define cyberspace as *an evolving man-made domain for the organization and transfer of data using various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The domain is a combination of private and public property governed by technical rule sets designed primarily to facilitate the flow of information.*⁵ The key feature of cyberspace is that it is a man-made domain designed to transfer data and information.\nInformation is the reason cyberspace exists, and this feature makes current discussions involving the international law of conflict management, *jus ad bellum*, so different from traditional *jus ad bellum* discussions. Simply put, information is fundamentally different than the traditional tools of war; bits and bytes bear no physical resemblance to bullets and bombs. Michael Schmitt noted that cyberspace threats differ in four ways from traditional threats: (1) computer networks are a new target category, with computer network attacks capable of providing the same results as striking the traditional target with a kinetic weapon; (2) an attack does not have to use kinetic force and can solely involve a command from one computer to the target system; (3) the intended results are often not kinetic and could simply involve the manipulation of data or disruption of a service; and (4) cyberspace threats are not constrained by political boundaries or geography.⁶\nI would add four more distinguishing factors between cyberspace threats and traditional or kinetic uses of force: (1) cyberspace attacks can be completed literally at the speed of light; (2) the results of some cyberspace attacks, whether intended or not, can be similar to those involving weapons of mass destruction;⁷ (3) the cost of acquiring the equipment and expertise to conduct operations in\n---\n⁵ This definition was developed jointly with my cyberspace law cohort, Major Noah Bledstein at 8 AF/JA. Major Bledstein has been working on cyberspace law issues since 2003. His assistance in discussing and developing the ideas and definitions in this paper was invaluable. It does not specifically address the issue of whether some part or all of cyberspace should be considered a global commons.\n⁶ Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, supra note 4, at 888.\n⁷ Because the infrastructure of modern societies relies on the technology and data which can be easily targeted during a cyberspace operation, the disabling of such infrastructure or manipulation of data could cause substantial damage and harm to a society. For example: disabling air traffic control systems or the systems which control the water flowing from a large dam, manipulating the data relied upon by banks or the International Monetary Fund, or manipulating the DNA coding for the subsequent year’s flu vaccine.\ncyberspace is *de minimis* in comparison to fielding conventional forces; and (4) attributing the attack to the responsible party and determining whether the attack was intentional or accidental is extremely difficult.⁸\nThe attribution problem, which this article discusses throughout, is indeed the elusive factor that most severely complicates the application of international law. In fact, the attribution problem makes cyberspace so different from other mediums or domains that it requires an entirely new international law approach. The unique nature of the cyber domain impacts not only national level decisions but also the development of law in this area, as evidenced by the current state of law regarding cyberspace and conflict management, which is discussed below.\n## B. Current Legal Approaches to Cyberspace Attacks\nThe majority of scholars considering attacks in cyberspace have used an ambiguous, effects-based analytical approach relying on international law to determine what constitutes a “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter or whether an “armed attack” occurred under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.⁹ The discussions and articles have also looked to other treaties that comprise international law and the law of war, such as the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions. On first impression, an effects-based approach to the issue that relies on\n⁸ A nuance of limited attribution is that much of the public is unaware of what is going on in cyberspace. In the other domains where military operations are conducted, the activities are much more visible. However, in cyberspace, we can’t easily spot electrons and data packets whisking by us or through a phone line.\n⁹ *See supra* note 4. A brief description of two of the leading approaches follows: First, Gary Sharp’s approach recognizes that a use of force in cyberspace may rise to the threshold of an armed attack, depending on its “scope, duration, and intensity,” which are factors previously relied upon by the United States (*See infra* note 28). Mr. Sharp suggests relying upon an analysis of how states have responded in previous cases to help analyze whether an unlawful use of force or armed attack have occurred, essentially relying on a normative analysis. Mr. Sharp summarizes his test by stating: “What constitutes a use of force of a scope, duration, and intensity that constitutes an armed attack and triggers the law of armed conflict is a question of fact that must be subjectively analyzed in each and every case in the context of all relevant law and circumstances.” SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 69. Michael Schmitt’s analytical approach involves six factors which are used to “délimit” economic/political coercion from determining what is a use of armed force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Mr. Schmitt’s premise for using an effects based approach primarily rests with his assessment that the U.N. Charter was not directly focused on outlawing “force” but rather the “deleterious consequences” of state actions, and outlawing uses of force under Article 2 was a “prescriptive short-hand to achieve their goals.” Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, *supra* note 4, at 911. I would recommend that all practitioners in this area read both works. Mr. Sharp’s book is especially invaluable as a thorough review of international law that applies to cyberspace operations.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 69\ninternational law seems to make sense, since it is electromagnetic data that moves through cyberspace and then creates an electromagnetic effect at the terminating point. The actors certainly focus on what effects they can achieve in and through cyberspace. These effects-based approaches add considerable value to the discussion of the issue, but they are unnecessarily constrained by relying primarily on legal documents and customary international norms developed before the advent of mass-produced computers.\nThe only substantial international legal document developed to address issues related to cyberspace is the European Union's Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰ (Cybercrime Convention). While the Cybercrime Convention does not address cyberspace attacks as possible acts of war and instead focuses on criminal acts, it does help establish a framework for a new methodology of analyzing cyberspace attacks. Instead of focusing on the end result of a cyberspace event, the effects, and trying to determine whether such an act is a use of force or armed attack under international law, a criminal law methodology places increased emphasis on the genesis of a cyberspace event. The criminal law approach thus focuses on defining the beginning of a cyberspace event and not the effects, and those definitions can then be applied to international law and military operations in cyberspace.\nBefore discussing the benefits of the criminal law approach, however, one must first understand how most commentators are currently applying international law to actions in cyberspace. A review of current scholarship on this issue will show the difficulty in applying decades old terms and norms to actions in cyberspace. As a starting point, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”¹¹\nHowever, without international sanctions there is little incentive for a party to comply with Article 2(4)’s peaceful objectives.¹² The\n¹⁰ Convention on Cybercrime, Nov. 23, 2001, 2296 U.N.T.S. 167, available at http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm.\n¹¹ U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4\n¹² Id. Art. 1 of the Charter states the purpose of the Charter. Subparagraph 1 specifically states:\nTo maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.\n70 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nhistorical reality is that most state actors have not conducted themselves as though they feared some form of international punishment for their actions. By itself, Article 2(4) seems, therefore, to create very little deterrent effect in conflict management.\nHowever, in contrast to Article 2(4), Article 51 permits parties to act in self-defense in response to an “armed attack.”¹³ Pragmatically, this right of self-defense can have the quickest success at reducing illegal uses of force constituting breaches of the peace, thereby increasing the deterrent effect of international law.¹⁴ While it is important to analyze whether a state action is a threat or use of force, the more critical question is whether the action is an armed attack, authorizing the recipient to respond in self-defense? The right of self-defense puts other states on notice that their offensive actions could be met with military force.\nThe right of self-defense has historically been limited by the reality that smaller nation states would respond against bigger and more powerful states with conventional force only if an attack truly jeopardized its national survival.¹⁵ This could be called the “bully dilemma” of international law.¹⁶ The “bully dilemma” pragmatically disenfranchises smaller and weaker states from the protection of Article 51. If a “bully” state engages in a small-scale breach of the peace against a significantly smaller state that smaller state will likely\n¹³ Mr. Sharp reasons “a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), however, the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.” Mr. Sharp recognizes that his position may not be held by all and that any right of self-defense is limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity. SHARP, supra note 4, at 48-49.\n¹⁴ When there is a threat or use of force under Article 2, the United Nations can impose sanctions, to include armed intervention under Chapter 7. However, building the consensus for such actions often takes considerable time and debate, while the victims of such use of force wait for relief. Even the liberation of Kuwait took more than six months before U.N. authorized forces began significant operations to remove Iraqi forces.\n¹⁵ For example, when the United States launched cruise missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan in August 1998, neither country responded with conventional force. The codename for the operation was “Infinite Reach.” What if Sudan had then possessed a capability to respond in cyberspace? How could Sudan respond in cyberspace, and would the U.S. have countered, if attribution could be obtained?\n¹⁶ Mr. Sharp, on page 52 of CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE, supra note 4, concluded the third chapter of his book by stating “[t]here is no black and white, mechanical rule in the law of conflict management that clearly defines what a use of force is under all circumstances.” He then followed that statement by using the opposite of the “bully dilemma” to demonstrate his conclusion that a use of force is a question of fact which must be subjectively analyzed: “For example, a state’s activity that is lawful against another state of equal size may nevertheless be significant enough against a smaller state to cross Article 2(4)’s ‘political independence’ threshold.” A subjective “size matters” approach to law provides no clarity and leaves smaller states wondering whether they can seek international assistance or defend themselves.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 71\nacquiesce to the aggression. The smaller state will likely determine that it is better to suffer outright defeat than to attempt to stop the aggression and fail. Meanwhile, as noted above, sanctions under the U.N. Charter are rarely invoked against the “bully” state, especially when the “bully” state is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and therefore holds a veto.\nHowever, in contrast to the historical “bully dilemma,” as depicted above, the asymmetric nature of operations in cyberspace now allows any party to possess the capability to swiftly act in self-defense with incredible lethality. The “bully” could soon be extinct and a new era of conflict could unfold, where the appearance of parity could inspire more breaches of the peace.¹⁷ This is why the development of law in this area must move forward.\n## C. Looking to Jus in Bello to Define Armed Attack\nThe potential lethality of cyberspace responses and unique attributes of cyberspace should compel international lawyers to consider the right of self-defense against cyberspace attacks in light of both the *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum*. Beginning with *jus in bello*, the focus of the examination is whether the current laws and definitions provide sufficient clarity to help nation states resolve what is an armed attack in cyberspace. Unfortunately, international law fails to define “armed attack”. The Geneva Conventions and additional documents relating to the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), *jus in bello*, do provide definitions of related terms that can clarify what international law would likely consider an armed attack. The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols are “not a separate paradigm of conflict management,” but are focused on *jus in bello* issues.¹⁸\nArticle 49 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I) defines “attack” as “acts of violence against the\n¹⁷ To use a college football analogy, the spread of the “West Coast Offense” to many universities has resulted in non-traditional powerhouse programs rising up and defeating Goliaths of the gridiron. Boise State University’s BCS victory over the University of Oklahoma highlights how smaller teams with allegedly lower quality recruits can use a new method of attack to level the playing field. In cyberspace operations, what is to stop a small nation state from responding with a non-attributable cyberspace operation in response to perceived threats or incursions by a “bullying” superpower? Even if the smaller state is questioned, it could respond that it is acting in self-defense to what it considered an armed attack with necessary actions to protect it from further harm. Such an asymmetric shift in warfare could result in an increasing number of “cyberspace conflicts” much like the low intensity conflicts of the 1980s. However, the capacity for “cyberspace conflicts” to rapidly escalate in lethality, due to self-defense actions, could be an incentive for nation states to instead look for a model that promotes deterrence.\n¹⁸ SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 77.\n72 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nadversary.\"¹⁹ The official commentary for Protocol I further adds that the definition “refers simply to the use of armed force to carry out a military operation.”²⁰ Note that because this definition requires the use of armed force, non-military personnel hacking into the New York Stock Exchange and causing substantial economic harm would not be an attack.²¹ Such an application identifies practical limitations with the current definition in Article 49.\nCommon Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions states that the Conventions shall apply during “any other armed conflict,” yet that term is not well defined in the conventions.²² The official commentary to Common Article 2 helps in understanding what is an armed conflict and states that “de facto hostilities” are sufficient. The commentary then makes clear the Conventions’ intention for a low threshold and broad application of the term “armed conflict”:\nThe substitution of this much more general expression for the word \"war\" was deliberate. One may argue almost endlessly about the legal definition of \"war.\" A\n¹⁹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/470?OpenDocument. The United States has not ratified Protocol I, but it is accepted as customary international law. It is interesting to note that Article 49 further states:\n[The] provisions of this section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.\n*Id.* International law recognizes distinctions with regard to conducting hostilities in the domains of air and sea, yet there is no strong movement for international recognition of the distinctive qualities of the domain of cyberspace.\n²⁰ Commentary for Protocol I, art. 49, para. 1882, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=470&amp;t=com.\n²¹ Even in 1977, international law failed to grasp the importance of economic battles that could bring a country to its knees.\n²² The four Geneva Conventions were signed on 12 August 1949.

The Geneva Conventions represent customary international law with regard to the conduct of armed hostilities or *jus in bello*.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 73\nState can always pretend, when it commits a hostile act against another State, that it is not making war, but merely engaging in a police action, or acting in legitimate self-defence. The expression \"armed conflict\" makes such arguments less easy. Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, or how much slaughter takes place.²³\nIn addition to the above statement, each of the four commentaries to the Geneva Conventions provides slightly different amplifying language for Article 2. This is, no doubt, due to the specific context of each of the four Geneva Conventions. For example, with respect to the First Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, the Commentary adds:\nThe respect due to human personality is not measured by the number of victims. Nor, incidentally, does the application of the Convention necessarily involve the intervention of cumbrous machinery. It all depends on circumstances. If there is only a single wounded person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .²⁴\n²³ Commentary to Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions. The quoted language is repeated in paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of each of the four Geneva Conventions.

Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Geneva Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12 1949, provides almost identical language, with a minor distinction regarding shipwrecked persons: “If there is only a single shipwrecked person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended. . . .” Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the\n74 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nThus, what is clear from the Commentaries regarding when an “armed conflict” has occurred is not the number or persons involved or whether the parties are using “cumbrous machinery”, such as tanks, rockets, planes, etc., or “even if there has been no fighting,” but simply whether there is “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces.” Further, a consistent theme is that “armed conflict” usually involves some sort of negative impact on at least one person, even if it is a civilian victim. The Commentary language begs the question—a question not answered—what is “intervention of the armed forces?”\nIn sum, this discussion of the Geneva Conventions as they relate to *jus in bello* reveals that “armed conflict” is an activity that involves acts of violence between armed forces, which affect at least one person, regardless of the amount of damage or suffering inflicted. Overall, the threshold is quite low and certainly does not require significant damage or loss of life. The policy concern to protect people from the harsh effects of conflict most likely inspired such a low, almost bright-line approach. While the definitions and Official Commentaries of the Conventions help explore the issue, the U.N. Charter remains the principal document for analyzing *jus ad bellum* issues relevant to the armed attack determination.\n## D. Armed Attack and Jus ad Bellum\nUnfortunately, the U.N. Charter itself provides very little by way of definition when it comes to the term, “armed attack.” Moreover, no official commentary addresses the issue. However, one place scholars have turned for clarification is the U.N. General Assembly’s 1974 resolution defining aggression, Resolution Number 3314. In that resolution, the General Assembly defined aggression as the “use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or\nConvention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12 1949, provides the following minor distinction:\nIt makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces; it suffices for the armed forces of one Power to have captured adversaries falling within the scope of Article 4. Even if there has been no fighting, the fact that persons covered by the Convention are detained is sufficient for its application. The number of persons captured in such circumstances is, of course, immaterial.\nParagraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War simply clarifies with regard to civilians that the “respect due to the human person as such is not measured by the number of victims.”\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 75\npolitical independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\"²⁵ More importantly, the resolution provides a number of specific acts that constitute aggression, including, but not limited to:\nInvasion, attack or military occupation; bombardment or the use of any weapons against a State; blockade; an attack on the land, sea, or air forces or the marine and air fleets of a State; and the sending of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries to complete any of the previous acts.²⁶\nThe resolution states that it may limit a finding of aggression in light of relevant circumstances, such as when the act is not of \"sufficient gravity.\" The pragmatic tone of this qualifying language is more consistent with how nation states subjectively conclude whether an armed attack occurred.²⁷ The term \"sufficient gravity\" may be an unintended endorsement of the \"bully dilemma.\" Thus, the \"bully\" state again avoids accountability when the international community determines its small-scale aggression is not of \"sufficient gravity,\" i.e. the international community is not sufficiently concerned about their own safety and security. Unfortunately, subjective conclusions do not add much clarity to resolving what acts would be considered an armed attack in cyberspace. As noted above, such definitional clarity is essential to aiding all states in understanding which acts in cyberspace can result in self-defense actions. If there was a legal framework, which created a clearer understanding of one's accountability in cyberspace, there would be a greater likelihood of deterring states from acting\n²⁵ G. A. Res. 3314, U.N. GAOR, 29th Sess., art. 1 (Dec. 14, 1974) available at http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/29/ares29.htm. This language is almost identical to the language found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n²⁶ Id. art. 3.\n²⁷ Mr. Sharp accurately notes that the United States uses the factors of scope, duration and intensity to determine whether de facto hostilities exist, but notes that the application has been inconsistent. When a Navy A-6 crew was shot down over Syria in 1983 and one of the crew members was captured, the U.S. claimed POW status for Lt Goodman and stated that “‘armed conflict’ includes any situation in which there is hostile action between the armed forces of two parties, regardless of the duration, intensity or scope of the fighting.” (emphasis added by this author) This is contrasted with the later U.S. position regarding the status of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant as an unlawful detainee, since the U.N. operations in Somalia “did not rise to the level of de facto international armed conflict.” SHARP, supra note 4, at 61-62. Essentially, Mr. Sharp’s position is that the U.S. position has evolved and now relies on the conjunctive “and” when applying the three factors of scope, duration, and intensity, versus the disjunctive “or.”\n76 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\naggressively in cyberspace, because they would know which acts could result in a cyberspace self-defense action.²⁸\nWhether one looks to the “Schmitt analysis” using six factors or Sharp’s approach of “heuristic analysis” to develop a profile of how states apply the factors of scope, duration, and intensity to the U.N. Charter and Common Article 2 framework, there appears to be no clear answer in contemporary international law. Mr. Sharp, quoting Ian Brownlie, attempted to illustrate how international law can be applied during an international incident: “the minor nature of an attack” helps to prove the “intention to attack, of honest mistake, or simply the limited objectives of an attack.”²⁹ Brownlie’s observation made sense in the days of conventional weapons and minor border skirmishes or incursions. One or two shots fired by a border guard versus dropping two 1,000 pound bombs can circumstantially help determine intent. Generally, with such kinetic attacks, the first or second order effects are readily discernable. However, warfare has changed and a new domain has evolved.\nIn cyberspace, what may appear as a “minor attack” could evolve into something much more destructive to a nation state, taking days or months to cause observable, significant harm. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks, and cyberspace attacks are quite different from the traditional methods of massing forces and building up logistics trains and lines of communication. States can much more easily identify preparation for a kinetic invasion versus a cyberspace onslaught. Asymmetric warfare may require asymmetric application of the law to provide the clarity and enforceability capable of promoting peace. The development of international law related to activities in cyberspace should not be delayed any longer.³⁰\nAnd why is finding a legally clear answer so difficult? In his writing, Sharp recognizes the concerns with a strict interpretation of Common Article 2, since such a “rote” application of the Article 2 threshold “intentionally causes military personnel to become belligerents and lawful targets even though they are conducting a peacetime military operation.”³¹ Sharp’s concern regarding a strict\n²⁸ Recall the conclusion of supra note 17 regarding how the asymmetric nature of cyberspace warfare could result in an increasing number of conflicts, all with the potential of having substantially greater effects than traditional low intensity conflicts. This asymmetric nature has created a potential deterrence vacuum, which the law must attempt to fill and states must then enforce.\n²⁹ SHARP, supra note 4, at 66 (quoting IAN BROWNLEIE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES, 366 (1954)).\n³⁰ I refer the reader to the two lead-off quotes at the beginning of this article. The lack of clear, enforceable law will only embolden activities in cyberspace and increase international tension and the likelihood of substantial physical damage in addition to the on-going intellectual carnage.\n³¹ SHARP, supra note 4, at 65-66.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 77\napplication of Common Article 2 to *jus ad bellum*, conflict management, is certainly justified with regard to the evolution of conventional military activities, such as peacekeeping and peacemaking.\nCyberspace operations, however, do not create the same concerns related to peacekeeping operations. There has been no move to create a U.N. “cyberspace peacekeeping force” to engage in online actions to enforce U.N. resolutions or sanctions, and cyberspace forces are not conducting humanitarian missions. In addition, neither Common Article 2, the U.N. Charter, nor the U.N. definition of aggression are contemporary enough to be strictly applied to activities in cyberspace, since they lack definitions applicable to the unique methods used in cyberspace operations. Nevertheless, the policy objective and low threshold of Common Article 2 provide hope that international law is capable of applying a stricter, definition-based approach to cyberspace attacks. The need for a legally clear answer should help shift the focus from an ambiguous, effects-based approach that relies solely on international law to the development of a definition-based approach capable of consistent application to cyberspace operations that affect other states.\n## E. Weapons are the Key\nThe U.N. General Assembly’s defined aggression to include the use of “any weapons” against another state. The use of such a clearly broad term as “any” logically implies that the use of even minor weapons against a state could be considered an act of aggression, if the circumstances are of “sufficient gravity.” Leaving aside the inevitably ambiguous discussion of events that may be of “sufficient gravity” in the eyes of the U.N. General Assembly, the General Assembly’s inclusion of the use of weapons in its definition of aggression brings the discussion regarding armed attacks in cyberspace back to the initial proposal of analyzing cyberspace attacks using the criminal law model.\nThe criminal law model’s reliance on clear definitions requires us to focus on the causative event, versus emphasizing the effects. For example, a crime is committed when a person fires a gun toward another, regardless of whether the other person is actually struck by a bullet. The minimum crime is some type of assault, likely an aggravated one, in the absence of a legal defense. If the person is struck by the bullet (effect of attack) or other circumstances are developed to indicate a more serious intent, then the chargeable crimes range from aggravated assault to murder. As this example demonstrates, under a criminal law approach, a crime (attack) occurred under all of the factual variations. The increase in harm (effect) only increases the level of punishment the offender may face from society and does not influence whether a crime of some sort occurred.\n78 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nRegardless of the severity of the crime (attack), societies have long recognized the policy interest in taking measures to respond to and deter crimes. This deterrence objective is a philosophical difference between a criminal law approach and an effects-based approach relying on international law. International law, relying upon an effects-based threshold, is implicated only when an incident’s consequences rise above a certain threshold. Whereas the criminal law model reacts even if there is just an attempt to commit a prohibited act. Thus, a criminal law approach focuses on the actual act and the method used, whether accessing a computer without proper authorization or robbing a bank with a gun. Relying on the criminal law approach allows one to examine the genesis of an attack at an even deeper level. The criminal law approach strives to provide clarity and consistency, allowing all members of a society to know what conduct is prohibited, which also serves the additional objective of deterrence. In the case of defining cyberspace attacks, a consideration of cyberspace weapons is the key to providing such clarity.\nThe use of a weapon of some kind is the true genesis of an attack. In fact, the types of weapons available to a state determine the possible attack methodologies.³² Thus, studying weapons is also important to understanding the strategy of potential adversaries. However, for the purpose of providing clarity to the issue of armed attacks in cyberspace, the definition of what is a weapon in cyberspace becomes the foundational question to developing a new approach to international law affecting cyberspace operations.\nWhile the U.N. General Assembly used the term “any weapon” and provided no further definition of what constitutes a weapon, one can turn to the law of armed conflict (LOAC) for assistance. Based on the LOAC’s specific guidance regarding conventional tools of war, conventional militaries tend to have a practical understanding of what are lawful and unlawful weapons. For example, exploding bullets and poisonous gas are unlawful weapons.³³ The LOAC focuses, however, almost completely on kinetic weapons.\nDespite its narrow focus on kinetic weapons, the LOAC has nevertheless struggled to define a “weapon,” and there is currently no\n³² For example, possessing and being able to field deep strike kinetic weapons such as low observable bombers opens up a range of options for a state actor. Likewise, possessing and being willing to use suicide bombers or biological weapons creates a tactical (asymmetric) advantage over adversaries. Thus, being able to conduct operations in cyberspace creates a new line of attack methods.\n³³ Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Oct. 18, 1907, art. 23, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/195?OpenDocument [hereinafter Hague Regulation (IV)].

Instead, Article 36 of Protocol I requires a review of any “new weapon, means or method of warfare” to ensure its use would comply with international law.³⁴ Although the United States has not ratified Protocol I, customary international law requires the review of weapons.³⁵\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has noted that each state tends to have its own definition of “weapon.”³⁶ Even within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) there is no standard definition of “weapon.”³⁷ Thus, each service developed its own definition of weapon, which it uses to determine whether a means or method of warfare requires a legal review in accordance with Article 36 of Protocol I. In the Air Force, paragraph 1 of Air Force Instruction 51-402, Weapons Review, 13 May 1994, defines weapons as “devices designed to kill, injure, or disable people, or to damage or destroy property.” The definition specifically excludes “electronic warfare devices.” The definition also differentiates between effects on people and effects on property, failing to include devices that “disable” property. Meanwhile, the United States Army and Navy each provide a definition of weapon that specifically includes devices that “disable” property.³⁸ Thus, the Army and Navy definitions appear to be more\n³⁴ Throughout the remainder of the discussion, the term “weapon” will be used in lieu of the broader term, “weapon, means or method of warfare.”\n³⁵ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONS LAW DIV., OFFICE OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL, DEP’T OF THE AIR FORCE, AIR FORCE OPERATIONS &amp; THE LAW 25, 48 (1st ed. 2002).

THE KEY TO THIS PUZZLE: CYBERSPACE WEAPONS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW DEFINITION-BASED MODEL\n### A. Defining Cyberspace Weapons\nThe criminal law approach and methodology help resolve the issues of ambiguity, enforceability, and attribution for two reasons. First, it provides strong definitions that can withstand judicial scrutiny and allow for fair application to a variety of fact patterns. A nuance of this first strength is that criminal law definitions must also clearly put everyone on notice as to prohibited activities. The second strength is that the criminal law methodology requires the definition of a prohibited act to have some degree of intent, also known as the scienter element. Relying on these strengths, the criminal law approach creates a definition of a cyberspace crime that is clear, flexible, and requires a minimum level of intent. The criminal law methodology will then enable us to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace crime in order to establish the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nAs noted earlier, the European Union’s Convention on Cybercrime is an international treaty intended to create consistency in criminal laws related to internet activities. Unfortunately, the Cybercrime Convention does not offer a definition of malicious logic or cyberspace weapon. Instead, the Cybercrime Convention identifies specific activities states should criminalize. Logically, the reason to prohibit certain activities is to avoid unwanted effects. The criminal law methodology is able to transform unwanted effects into specific definitions and prohibitions, whereas the current approach under international humanitarian law relies on an ambiguous analysis of facts using undefined prohibitions.\nThe intent of the Cybercrime Convention was to set up a basic framework whereby the parties agreed to create their own state criminal codes to address broadly defined prohibited activities. Because the Convention defines prohibited activities broadly, it does not provide the detailed definitions of actual effects in cyberspace necessary to specifically define a cyberspace weapon. Nevertheless, the Convention’s aspirational criminal law definitions of unlawful activity in cyberspace can help identify the international community’s thoughts\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 81\nregarding unlawful cyberspace effects and thus the weapons that cause those effects. By looking at what types of activities the Cybercrime Convention intends to criminalize, it is possible to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nSpecifically, the Cybercrime Convention provides that the parties will adopt laws that criminalize cyberspace crimes such as: unlawful access, unlawful interception, interfering with data or systems, and computer fraud or forgery.³⁹ Looking at the broad definitions for these offenses under the Cybercrime Convention, terms such as “obtaining,” “damaging,” “deleting,” “deteriorating,” “altering” or “suppressing” data represent a common theme of what happens to electromagnetic data when a cyberspace crime occurs.⁴⁰\nThis criminal law framework parallels the scenarios discussed by many others with regard to armed attacks in cyberspace. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense defines Computer Network Attack as: “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”⁴¹ Whether a cyberspace crime or a cyberspace attack, the goal is to affect someone else’s data, or use data to affect property.\nThe domain of cyberspace is obviously not as physically transparent as the domains of air and space. If one were to try and “fire” one million volts at a cyberspace target, there are too many information nodes, such as routers and switches, along the internet pathway that would become the unintended recipient of the “electromagnetic missile.” The one million volt “electromagnetic missile” would cause\n³⁹ See Convention on Cybercrime, supra note 10, at arts. 2-8.\n⁴⁰ Id. arts. 4, 5. Article 4 provides:\nData interference: 1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data without right. 2. A Party may reserve the right to require that the conduct described in paragraph 1 result in serious harm.\nArticle 5 provides:\nSystem interference: Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.\n⁴¹ JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUB. 1-02, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS 113 (17 Mar. 2009) [hereinafter JP 1-02].\n82 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\ncollateral damage to those nodes and would be worn down long before it reached its intended target. Cyberspace attacks, just like criminal hacks, are designed to affect electromagnetic data in various ways, which then impact the adversary's cyberspace to create an operational advantage for the attacker. Thus, the basic legal framework of the Cybercrime Convention is beneficial in the context of military operations in cyberspace.\nAlthough the Cybercrime Convention does not provide definitions of key terms such as \"damaging\" or \"altering,\" the Cybercrime Convention points us to the criminal codes of party states, such as the United States, to specifically define the actus reus. The criminal code of the United States is considered for several reasons: the United States invented the internet; the United States is arguably the largest user of cyberspace; the United States is a leading prosecutor of cyberspace crimes; and many nations work with the United States to solve cyberspace crimes.\nSection 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes intentionally causing damage to a protected computer. Section 1030 is often used by U.S. Attorneys to prosecute persons who steal or corrupt data located on computer systems and persons who engage in denial of service attacks. Section 1030 defines \"damage\" as \"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.\" This definition of \"damage\" recognizes the reality of what happens during a criminal hack or a cyberspace attack: \"damage\" in cyberspace does not require smashing, burning, or blowing things up. The U.S. Code provides a clear, judicially accepted and internationally recognized definition of damage in the cyberspace realm. By borrowing from this definition, it is possible to logically develop a definition of a cyberspace weapon, the key to the puzzle.\nFrom the above, we see that in its most simple terms, the definition of a weapon is \"something that causes damage.\" Applying the definition of damage from Section 1030, I propose the following definition of a cyberspace weapon: Any capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system. Although the proposed definition uses the term\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n83\n“impair” versus the DOD favored term “disable,” the terms are somewhat similar in meaning. The term “disable” requires that a weapon must cause a complete loss of function, while the term “impair” recognizes that malicious software code need only reduce an information system’s capability, i.e. degrade.⁴⁵\n## B. Applying the Definition of a Cyberspace Weapon\nNow that we have defined cyberspace weapon, the remaining challenge is to determine whether the proposed definition works within the context of cyberspace operations and within the current limits of international law. While the first instances of negative code may not have been written with the intent of harming a computer, today the story is quite different. Today, the development of computer code that negatively impacts an information system has evolved and spread like an advanced, persistent plague. The tools of the modern hacker, whether criminal, military, terrorist, geek, or spy, are broadly referred to as malicious logic. While malicious logic can take many forms, the key question for our purposes is: “At what point does malicious logic become a cyberspace weapon, the use of which constitutes an armed attack under international law?” The first part of the question focuses not on the end result but on the “tool” used in cyberspace and whether that tool is a “weapon.” The second part of the question will focus on the weapon’s use in cyberspace.\nFirst, one must consider whether particular cyberspace “tools” constitute weapons under international law. The ICRC Commentary on Article 35 of Additional Protocol I states: “The words ‘methods and means’ include weapons in the widest sense, as well as the way in which they are used.”⁴⁶ Furthermore, the ICRC Guide on New Weapons expounds on the above commentary provision by noting that the legal\n⁴⁵ Again, recall that while the services’ definitions of weapon all used the term “disable,” JP 1-02, supra note 41, uses the term “degrade” when describing Computer Network Attack.\n⁴⁶ Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1402 (for art. 35). Article 35 provides overarching guidance regarding the means and methods of warfare and reads:\nBasic rules - 1. In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. 2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. 3. It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.\nProtocol I, supra note 19, at art. 35.\n84 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nreview requirements of Article 36 apply even to non-lethal weapons based on “the ways in which these weapons are to be used pursuant to military doctrine, tactics, rules of engagement, operating procedures and countermeasures” and also applies to all acquired weapons, whether procured based on military specifications or “off-the shelf.”47 Both the Commentary and the ICRC guide conclude that the analysis regarding whether a weapon is lawful or unlawful should be focused on the weapon’s “normal or expected use.”48\nNext, one must analyze how the proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon can be applied in the real-world context of two recent “cyberspace attacks” in Estonia and Georgia. Considering the realities of these two events, does the proposed definition provide sufficient clarity for use in international law?\nThe cyberspace event in April and May of 2007 in Estonia involved a number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) actions against the networks for the two largest banks, effectively severing all internet communications for two hours and causing partial interruptions thereafter.49 The event also included acts against an Estonian government internet service provider that “disrupted government communications for at least a short period of time.”50 Lastly, the web page for the Estonian Prime Minister was “defaced,” manipulating it to show an alleged apology for moving a Soviet World War II memorial.51 Clearly, the event in Estonia resulted in reduced availability and impaired the integrity of the information located on computer systems in Estonia. Applying the attacker’s methods to the proposed definition, it is clear these methods constituted “cyberspace weapons.”\nThe cyberspace event that occurred in July and August of 2008 in Georgia results in a similar conclusion. Again, a DDoS event targeted the website of the Georgian President, making it unavailable for 24 hours. Attackers also defaced the website with pictures of Adolf Hitler next to the image of the Georgian President, and, using malicious logic, caused websites for other government agencies to lose connectivity.52 Here again, the methods used by cyberspace attackers in Georgia caused a loss of access and impaired the integrity of the data. Consequently, it is appropriate to label these methods as “cyberspace weapons.” The proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon therefore\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 85\n47 ICRC GUIDE ON NEW WEAPONS, supra note 36, at 9–10.\n48 Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1469 (for art. 35).\n49 Kenneth Geers, Cyberspace and the Changing Nature of Warfare, Keynote Speech for NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CDCOE) 9 (Oct. 13, 2008), available at http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/Cyberspace%20and%20the%20Changing%20Nature%20of%20Warfare.pdf (NATO CDCOE can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.ccdcoe.org).\n50 Id.\n51 Id.\n52 NATO COOPERATIVE CYBER DEFENCE CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE, supra note 2, at 28-33.\nprovides the degree of clarity to move the discussion forward to defining a cyberspace attack.\n## C. When is the Use of a Cyberspace Weapon a Cyberspace Attack?\nAcknowledging that cyberspace weapons were used in the events in Estonia and Georgia does not answer the ultimate question of whether the acts should be considered armed attacks under international law? Here again, the temptation is to return to an effects-based analysis to answer the question. However, as noted at the beginning of this article, previous attempts to answer the question using such an analysis provide ambiguous answers at best. Instead, by applying a definition-based approach, much like the criminal law does, there is a higher likelihood of reaching a clear answer. Therefore, in order to determine when the use of a cyberspace weapon constitutes an “armed attack” under international law, one must look to how the cyberspace weapon is used rather than its effects.\nThis question of how a weapon is used is the key transitional point in this analytical approach and borrows substantially from the criminal law. For example, a gun can either be a weapon used to kill people or a weapon used to assist a hunter in gathering food. The intent of the user remains the primary issue under the criminal law. Using this criminal law approach will enable conversion of the above question into a definition applicable to the international law arena.\nTo prove an offense under the criminal law, almost all crimes require proof of *mens rea*, the idea of a criminal intent or purpose. Specifically, most crimes require proof of either specific or general intent or knowledge. The most difficult *mens rea* to prove is specific intent, whereas knowledge is much more easily inferred from the circumstances. Considering history and the unwillingness of state actors to admit their actual intent, proving the specific or general intent of a state actor is very difficult when relying on circumstantial evidence, and would therefore result in an unenforceable definition beneficial only to academic discussions.\nTherefore, because proof of knowledge is easier to prove than either a specific or general *mens rea*, it will lead to a more enforceable standard and place a higher level of responsibility on states. Even though knowledge is a lower threshold than specific or general intent, it is nevertheless a common and accepted *mens rea* requirement under criminal law. Still, the question remains, knowledge of what? As will be discussed further below, state actors have a responsibility, as sovereigns with power and control, to conduct their affairs with due regard for their international legal obligations when they have knowledge of activities within their legal or physical boundaries. Hence, it is appropriate to consider the following definition of a\n86 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\n\"cyberspace attack\": A cyberspace attack occurs when a state knowingly uses or knowingly acquiesces to an entity under its legal control or within its territory using a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state.\nThe proposed definition of cyberspace attack essentially imposes additional responsibility under international law when a state knowingly allows a person or entity to use a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state. Under the unique circumstances of cyberspace, such a clear definition establishes the increased degree of responsibility necessary to promote international peace and help deter the myriad of adverse activities in cyberspace. Consider the actions of one rogue group if they were to successfully conduct a cyberspace attack against the critical infrastructure of another state. Regardless of the group's motives, whether nationalistic, ideological, or criminal, causing the death of several hundred people and millions of dollars worth of property damage is a scenario that international law must evolve to address and deter. Still, if the state is completely unaware of a rogue element's activities, then it seems appropriate not to impart responsibility and accountability under international law.\nHowever, what if the state that can legally control the rogue element knew that the element was about to or was currently engaging in a cyberspace attack against persons or property in the victim state? The responsible state could, if necessary, disrupt all communications originating from the rogue element or emanating from the state until it could locate and arrest the attackers for violating their domestic laws. The definition of a cyberspace attack, although similar to the definition of a cyberspace crime, is not intended to hold states responsible for the nefarious efforts of criminals, unless the state is aware of the criminal's efforts and knowingly acquiesces to the use of a cyberspace weapon. The objective is to develop a legal framework that inspires states to cooperate to eliminate the harmful use of cyberspace—to create deterrence.\nWithout the proposed legal framework, why should a state try to stop an impending cyberspace attack against another state? Under current state practice, if the victim state is an \"ally,\" then the responsible, \"host\" state will likely feel much more compelled to take positive steps to stop the attack. For example, if a hacker in the United Kingdom was conducting a cyberspace attack against the Hoover Dam in the United States, U.K. security and law enforcement officials would almost certainly act with all diligence to stop the attack and arrest the perpetrators, and would likely allow their extradition to the United States. However, how many cyberspace events against entities in the\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace\n87\nUnited States has the People’s Republic of China informed the United States about, and how many times have they stopped and subsequently arrested the offenders? This question indicates the problem with the current model of international law that relies on state practice, subjective assessments, alliances and the “bully dilemma.” International law is currently too vague, as noted by the lead-off quote from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\nSome argue that international law may not be inclined to place such a clear responsibility on states for acquiescing to uses of cyberspace weapons, unless they caused effects equivalent to more traditional armed attacks.⁵⁴ However, the United Nations has issued resolutions that appear to place a higher burden on states to refrain from acquiescing to certain acts committed from their territory against other states. For example, a General Assembly Resolution in 1970, number 2625, discussed acquiescence and said that states have a duty to refrain from acquiescing or tolerating actions from within its territory that cause civil strife in the other state.⁵⁵ More recently, the United Nations\nof U.S. military servers in 2001 and 2002.

Res. 2625, U.N. GAOR, 25th Sess. (Oct. 24, 1970). The key excerpts from the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among states in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations are:\nEvery State has a duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting, or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force . . .\nAlso, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State. . .\nStates have the duty to co-operate with one another, irrespective of the differences in their political, economic and social systems, in the various spheres of international relations, in order to maintain international peace and security . . .\nAll states enjoy sovereign equality. They have equal rights and duties . . .\nThe principles of the Charter which are embodied in this Declaration constitute basic principles of international law . . .\n88 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nSecurity Council issued Resolution 1373 on September 28, 2001, which reaffirmed the key principles in Resolution 2625. Resolution 1373 decided under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that all states shall take the necessary steps to prevent terrorist acts, to prevent terrorists from using their territories for terrorist purposes, and to provide early warning to other states.⁵⁶\nAlthough not directly on point with all scenarios of cyberspace attack, some cyberspace attacks could fit within the resolutions’ already accepted prohibitions related to harboring terrorists, preventing use of territory by terrorists, and acquiescing to those who cause civil strife. The proposed definition of armed attack in cyberspace would really only increase the degree of state responsibility for non-state actors by a small amount. In light of the growing concern related to the impact of non-state actors on international peace, and considering the asymmetric and potentially dangerous attributes of cyberspace, such an increase in state responsibility is not unreasonable.\nThe strength of the proposed definition of cyberspace attack is that it would place a clear responsibility on all states. All states would know what international law requires and non-state actors would know that their actions could be considered armed attacks. Although clear and strict in comparison to the current approach, the proposed legal threshold is not improperly low. It has a reasonable *mens rea* requirement, to wit: the host state must have knowledge of the impending or ongoing use of a cyberspace weapon. Because the proposed definition requires knowing acquiescence, a state can claim the defense of impossibility. For example, the host state may have no knowledge of an ongoing cyberspace attack because the rogue element first hacked into and gained control of the entire host state’s communications infrastructure. Still, once the host state became aware of the intended location of the attack, it would then be responsible to at least communicate that information to the victim state and continue to take reasonable measures to stop or impede the attack and cooperate with the victim state.\nThe unique attributes of cyberspace, such as its speed and lack of physical borders, are key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory when they do not take reasonable measures to stop the attack and warn the victim state. One cannot overemphasize the potency of the asymmetric capabilities of cyberspace in comparison to any other war-fighting domain in the world’s history, a capability that enables almost any person to engage in actions with\n⁵⁶ S.C. Res. 1373, U.N. SCOR, 4385th mtg., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1373 (Sept. 28, 2001) condemning the terrorist attacks of 9-11 and stating that “those responsible for aiding, supporting or harboring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of such acts will be held accountable.”); see also G.A. Res. 56/1, U.N. GAOR, 56th Sess., U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/1 (Sept. 12, 2001).\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 89\nlethal and costly effects. Therefore, another difference between the proposed definition and current requirements under international law is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack does not include a requirement that the attack involve the armed forces of the aggressor, as the commentary to Common Article 2 requires and the U.N. definition of aggression implies. However, the U.N. definition of aggression clearly includes mercenaries and irregulars. Once more, considering the asymmetric nature of cyberspace, requiring a cyberspace attack to involve the armed forces or mercenaries of the aggressor would create a legal hole big enough for hundreds of thugs and brigands to \"attack\" the victim state. In consideration of the incredible amount of physical or information damage that non-state actors can cause in cyberspace, knowing acquiescence to such attacks is the correct standard for imposing state responsibility under international law.\nBut, is it fair to impose such strict accountability on the use of cyberspace, when some cyberspace attributes, such as ease of access and use, are similar to those of global commons? For example, some may argue that the proposed definition is contrary to Article 8 of the Hague Regulation (V). Article 8 provides that “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” It is accepted that many cyberspace communications occur over “telephone cables” and similar telecommunications infrastructure. Thus, the language of Article 8 is applicable to cyberspace operations. Article 8 clearly does not place a duty on a neutral power to forbid or restrict belligerents from using their communications infrastructure. In fact, Article 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) states that any restrictive measures implemented by a neutral power must be equally applied to “both belligerents.” Article 8’s language, therefore, appears to contradict the proposed definition.\nAlternatively, one could argue that the proposed definition of cyberspace attack does not conflict with Article 8, because the proposed definition creates a transitional status for a state. Once a state becomes aware of a cyberspace attack originating from its territory and targeting another state, it is no longer a \"neutral power\" and now must act to stop the attack or become a de facto \"belligerent.\" The idea of a state transitioning between being a neutral power and a belligerent may be too tenuous for realistic application in international law. In the alternative, states could choose, when adopting the proposed definition\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nof cyberspace attack, to explicitly state that Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) no longer apply to cyberspace.\nGoing back to the Estonia and Georgia events, most media attributed the use of cyberspace weapons to Russian internet addresses. Despite early and widespread media attribution to Russia, the attacks continued, strongly implying that Russia was directly responsible for the attacks.⁵⁸ Apparently, Russian law enforcement and security services made no effort to stop the cyberspace attacks.⁵⁹ Russia was certainly on notice that the world community believed the cyberspace attacks were originating from within its borders. While circumstantial evidence clearly indicated that Russia knowingly acquiesced to these attacks, there was no direct evidence. Reviewing the circumstantial evidence under the proposed definition indicates that Russia violated international law and the victim states had the right of self-defense. However, relying on circumstantial evidence is not something the international community and international law are generally comfortable doing.\nThis lack of direct evidence is indicative of the attribution problem currently hindering all investigations of actions in cyberspace. Investigators of domestic cyberspace crimes meticulously use forensic tools to identify which specific internet protocol (IP) address is responsible for a cyberspace crime and then interview the suspect to determine their level of knowledge or intent. Unfortunately, overseas investigations can only be accomplished if there is cooperation between the involved states. When a foreign state does not provide equal access to forensic evidence and suspects, the attribution barrier obstructs the inquiry and protects the “attacker.” Such actions do not promote peace or resolve conflict.\nThe effects-based model would likely conclude that the Estonia and Georgia attacks were not severe enough to be considered armed attacks or even an unlawful use of force. There were no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack. The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy. Reviewing the international reaction after the fact, there were no declarations by the international\n⁵⁸ Arthur Bright, *Estonia accuses Russia of ‘cyberattack,’* CHRISTIAN SCI.

Charter or that they created de facto hostilities under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions. Estonia chose not to consider them armed attacks, while the Georgia situation simultaneously devolved into a kinetic conflict. What option did Estonia really have? If Estonia felt it had sufficient attribution, Estonia could have considered the acts armed attacks, creating a de facto state of hostilities and requested the assistance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under the NATO Treaty’s collective self-defense provision.⁶⁰ Estonia could have waited for NATO to risk war with Russia. Estonia could also have responded in self-defense with conventional, kinetic forces, since they did not have any “cyberspace forces.” The potential result could have been a strong conventional response from Russia, including occupation of Estonia. Again, the “bully dilemma” reared its head. This prompts the question, is it fair to rely on a 60 year-old conventional model that gives such weight to state practice when the kinetic forces and available cyberspace capabilities are so disproportionate?\nIndeed, continued reliance on such a model could lead “minor” states to develop cyberspace forces in an effort to achieve an asymmetric advantage over states with much larger kinetic capabilities, leading to a cyberspace arms race and possibly more conflicts. As the Estonia and Georgia events demonstrate, when a state knowingly chooses to not assist a victim state or hold responsible those who use cyberspace weapons against other states, international law should view that state as a transgressor.\nThat is what the proposed definition of cyberspace attack intends to do. The proposed definition will have a positive impact on international law and conflict management, because it will clearly place\n⁶⁰ North Atlantic Treaty art. 5, Apr. 4, 1949, 63 Stat. 2241, 34 U.N.T.S. 243. Article 5 states:\nThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.\n92 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nresponsibility on all states to not engage in cyberspace attacks and to police and secure their cyberspace “borders.”⁶¹ Essentially, everyone will know a cyberspace attack when they see it, and everyone will know that any state that conducts or permits such an attack could suffer self-defense actions and international sanctions. The end result would hopefully be a dramatic decrease in cyberspace events of foreign origin, which would also reduce the likelihood of a cyberspace “arms race” and cause the de-escalation of low intensity conflicts in cyberspace.\n## D. Flies in the Ointment: Attribution and Espionage\nAs referenced above, an effects-based approach magnifies the attribution problem, because it requires attribution of intentional direct participation or support by the state actor, versus knowing acquiescence. The difficulty of attribution in cyberspace prevents the evolution of realistic customary norms.⁶² No state actor can realistically consider the full spectrum of actions, because they do not know who acted against them or why. In addition, the difficulty in comprehending the full severity of the “attack,” because of the delayed effects of cyberspace weapons, compounds the difficulty in determining an appropriate response.\nUnlike the effects-based approach, the proposed definition does not require determining who controlled or supported the activity, the aggressor’s intent, or the full magnitude of the attack. Using the\n⁶¹ The concept of boundaries and sovereignty in cyberspace is also a topic of discussion amongst academics and practitioners. Although there is no clear definition and enforcement of boundaries in cyberspace, all states should recognize that electronic communications of all types originate in one state and can terminate (and have effects) in another state. Therefore, a state can monitor communications occurring inside its geographic borders. For example, the NSA under the Terrorist Surveillance Program was able to monitor communications where one party was located “outside” the United States. White House Press Briefing, Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales &amp; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, Principal Deputy Dir. of Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2005/intell-051219-dni01.htm. The concept of cyberspace borders has even been expanded to include discussions of a cyberspace Monroe Doctrine with regard to cyberspace infrastructure associated to the United States. See Reviewing the Federal Cybersecurity Mission: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Homeland Sec., Sub-Comm. on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, &amp; Sci. &amp; Tech., 110th Cong.

In order for scientific experiments and their results to be reliable, external factors must be eliminated or controlled, and all other factors must be accurately known. The lack of attribution makes it impossible to accurately complete a heuristic analysis, since three of the most important factors, identity, intent, and full severity of attack, will rarely be known without it.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 93\ndefinitional approach, only two questions need to be resolved. First, was a cyberspace weapon used against the property or persons of a state? Second, did a foreign state knowingly allow an entity under its legal control to use the cyberspace weapon against the victim?\nEven with the proposed definitions and a two element test, one of the oldest arts, espionage, can still take advantage of the attribution difficulties in cyberspace. Espionage has long been recognized as essential to the success of states and their militaries.⁶³ While a criminal offense in virtually every nation state, espionage is not a violation of the law of war and was first recognized in the Lieber Code in 1863.⁶⁴ It was subsequently codified in the 1907 Hague Regulations and in Protocol I.⁶⁵ Acts deemed to be espionage will not trigger a state’s right to self-defense, because espionage does not violate international law. Based on the definitions from the various documents considered part of customary international law, the consistent requirement for espionage is that a member of the armed forces gathers or attempts to gather information under false pretenses or while not wearing their uniform.\nSuch a definition does not perfectly transfer over to espionage in cyberspace. Whether the person at the other computer terminal is wearing his uniform is irrelevant to attributing his identity and intent in cyberspace. Still, a cyberspace spy will intrinsically gain access to the information or data under false pretenses. The average cyberspace intruder does not disclose his identity nor does he come to the main web page and ask the webmaster for permission. Instead, he exploits vulnerabilities in software coding that allow him to gain unauthorized access, which is essentially under false pretenses as discussed in Article\n⁶³ Sun Tzu stated: “So, as for enlightened lords or distinguished commanders, the reason they can overcome the adversary when action is taken and achieve unparalleled success is prescience. Prescience cannot be gained from ghost or gods . . . . It must be gained from what is learned by men.” SUN TZU, SUN TZU: THE NEW TRANSLATION 112 (J. H. Huang trans. 1993).\n⁶⁴ FRANCIS LIEBER, INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIELD, ART. 88 (Apr. 24, 1863), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/110?OpenDocument [hereinafter LIEBER CODE]. Article 88 defines a spy as: “a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy.”\n⁶⁵ Article 29 of Hague Regulation (IV), supra note 33, defines a spy thus:\n[A]cting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information, are not considered spies.\nArticle 46 of Protocol I, supra note 19, provides that a member of the armed forces shall not be considered a spy “unless he does so through an act of false pretences or deliberately in a clandestine manner.”\n94 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\n29 of Hague Regulation IV. Even when an intruder sends an e-mail directly to an authorized user, asking the user to provide his password information, the e-mail is still sent under false pretenses.⁶⁶\nIt is certainly possible for cyberspace spies to gain access to information and copy or degrade the data without the use of a cyberspace weapon. However, the tension between lawful espionage and armed attack in cyberspace occurs when a spy uses a cyberspace weapon to access or steal information. If a traditional spy uses a weapon, such as a pistol, the act is viewed as a criminal act, versus an armed attack. Should the same be true of a cyberspace spy who hacks into a system by using a cyberspace weapon? Applying the proposed definition of cyberspace attack, the use of a cyberspace weapon while committing espionage in or through cyberspace could be interpreted as a cyberspace attack and result in self-defense actions.\nThe only way to resolve the tension between cyberspace espionage and cyberspace attack is to determine whether the cyberspace intruder intends solely to copy and then steal the data or information. Again, this dilemma adds a layer of complexity to the attribution issue by now requiring a determination of the actor’s full intent, creating an untenable situation for the victim state. Given that actions happen so fast in cyberspace, a spy or attacker could move “in and out” before a victim state could do any more than determine the foreign internet protocol (IP) address of the intruder. A full damage assessment, identifying what happened to the victim computer system could take hours to weeks. While some cyberspace attacks may be obvious, many will not be, as the beauty of cyberspace warfare is the ability to create second and third order effects, which are difficult to identify in advance.\nThe attribution issue reaches a pinnacle of complexity when trying to resolve events between espionage and cyberspace attacks. Therefore, today, a victim state is left with three choices: (1) continue to operate in the current international system of subjective analysis and inconsistent past responses while ineffectively trying to gather very detailed attribution information; (2) develop a robust cyberspace force capable of conducting cyberspace attacks, cyberspace espionage, and able to “hack back” to develop reasonably detailed attribution information; (3) or issue an ultimatum to the international community, hoping that others will agree, which informs all other states that any activity in that state’s territory that is determined to satisfy the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack will justify self-defense actions by the victim state.\n⁶⁶ Phishing or spear phishing emails target known users on a network and always provide a false reason for the recipient to provide key information or click on a hyperlink that will then redirect the user to another web page where malicious code, read weapon, will be surreptitiously installed on the user’s computer.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 95\nThe difficulty with resolving the espionage issue is that under the first option a state remains vulnerable to many forms of cyberspace attack while attempting to resolve whether the event is an act of espionage or cyberspace attack and waiting for the international community to subjectively analyze the evidence. In addition, the evidence to satisfy the international community would likely include the elusive proof of actual intent to harm the victim state. Adversarial states could choose to take advantage of this slow analysis and decision loop, achieving paralysis by analysis, and methodically weaken a state with what appears to be cyberspace espionage but is in fact a number of cyberspace attacks aimed at creating third order effects. Lastly, it appears that states are not willingly sharing the details of their cyberspace activities with others, which still leaves a void of necessary information to conduct the required heuristic analysis to develop the law under the current framework.\nThe second option will help the state protect itself from adversarial activities in cyberspace and possibly lead to attributable information. In spite of this benefit, the potential of a cyberspace arms race increases. This development could lead to an increase in low scale cyberspace conflicts and ultimately result in an adversary conducting a second or third order cyberspace attack inflicting massive casualties or property damage.67 The continued development of cyberspace capabilities appears to be the current direction of the leading states, such as China, Russia, and the United States. States certainly cannot be faulted for taking such an approach, as the current international legal scheme offers them very little protection yet many opportunities to exploit the cyberspace of other states. Therefore, the race for dominance in cyberspace has begun and may soon grow out of control.\nThe second option also has some parallels to the approach that states took when nuclear tensions were high during the Cold War. The superpowers recognized that conventional methodologies could not be applied to the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). States recognized that Article 51’s right of self-defense limited them to proportional actions. However, due to the overwhelming effect and fairly rapid speed of any nuclear attack, states were doctrinally prepared to respond in full at the first indication of even a limited attack, since they recognized that they could not afford to wait and see how many warheads or which locations the adversary’s warheads hit and how much damage they caused. Superpowers projected that they were capable, prepared, and willing to respond to even a limited, targeted nuclear first-strike with a full-scale response.\n67 Cyberspace attacks against critical infrastructure, aircraft and air traffic control software, navigation systems (GPS), and pharmaceutical companies to alter the code for medicines and vaccines are just some examples of cyberspace attacks that may not have recognizable first order effects, but catastrophic subsequent effects.\n96 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nHistorically, one can see how nation states adopted their practice in light of the dramatic increase in speed and lethality of nuclear attacks using ICBM’s compared to the previous conventional method of warfare, circa World War II. While many decried the age of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and called it “mad,” one cannot dispute that during that time period, even though there was a nuclear arms race, no nuclear weapons were used. Mad or not, MAD was an effective method of deterrence. There are a number of parallels between the use of ICBMs and cyberspace operations: cyberspace attacks have the potential for incredible lethality; much greater speed than previous weapons; and the actual severity of the threat, the intent, and the identity of the actor are usually too difficult to determine in sufficient time to respond appropriately before the damage is done.\nHowever, there is one crucial difference between today’s option two situation (developing a robust cyberspace force and “hacking back”) and the deterrence model of MAD during the Cold War. Currently, it does not appear that a substantial number of states are willing to make a declaration of mutually assured destruction through cyberspace and simultaneously abstain from conducting cyberspace operations. Without such declarations and cessation of the use of cyberspace weapons, the parallels with the Cold War nuclear deterrence model end. Pragmatically, states do not feel the impetus to consider such an approach. There has been no mass disaster or 9-11 type “wake-up call” in cyberspace, and, as noted above, a number of states likely believe they can “win” in cyberspace. Therefore, applying the nuclear deterrence model to cyberspace operations is not practical. Unfortunately, history has shown that society rarely chooses to collectively legislate against harm until after it suffers the consequences.\nStill, there is one historical example where society chose to proactively legislate and limit the weaponization of a domain, much like option three. The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space.⁶⁸ The third option can perhaps draw strength from the efforts to limit the militarization of space, recognizing cyberspace as a sort of international commons similar to outer space. Each state, relying on the proposed definitions, would still retain its sovereignty and control of cyberspace infrastructure located within its borders. The implementation of the proposed definitions would recognize that the use of cyberspace is intended for peace-promoting purposes and the use of weapons in cyberspace, even for espionage purposes, will not be accepted. Providing states the right of self-defense using the lower, clear threshold of the proposed\n⁶⁸ Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Jan. 27, 1967, 6 I.L.M. 386, available at http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 97\ndefinitions will hopefully inspire states to abstain from cyberspace espionage and attacks and cooperate to protect the peaceful use of cyberspace.\n## IV. APPLYING THE DEFINITIONS AND EXERCISING SELF-DEFENSE IN CYBERSPACE\nIn order to further understand how option three’s (issuing an ultimatum that the state could respond in self-defense to cyberspace attacks) use of the proposed definitions will promote peace and reduce the improper use of cyberspace, it is helpful to explore how states could act in response to a cyberspace attack. The doctrine of self-defense relies on two principles: necessity and proportionality. Necessity involves whether effective peaceful means of resolution exist; the nature of the aggression, each party’s objectives, and the likelihood of effective intervention by the international community.⁶⁹ Proportionality requires limiting the magnitude, scope, and duration of the force used in response to that which is reasonably necessary to counter the threat or attack.⁷⁰ The timing of a self-defense action is closely related to the factor of necessity and is a debated issue. A delayed response weakens a state’s claim of necessity to defend itself. While an early response in anticipation of attack also draws questions as to the certainty of need for the self-defense action.\nLooking at necessity and the timing of self-defense actions in cyberspace, the unique qualities of cyberspace again highlight the importance of moving toward a deterrence model. Once a state suffers what it believes to be an armed attack in or through cyberspace, it can arguably satisfy the above requirements of necessity to defend itself. Unfortunately, in cyberspace, there will likely not be sufficient time to consider peaceful resolution of the matter, fully understand the nature of the attack or the intended results, or to mobilize international peacekeeping forces. Thus, the more difficult question related to necessity is how appropriate is anticipatory self-defense in cyberspace?\nAnticipatory self-defense “justifies use of force in anticipation of an ‘imminent’ armed attack.”⁷¹ Basically, a state need not wait to receive the aggressor’s attack and can instead act in self-defense to “repel” the attack.⁷² The doctrine “finds it roots in the 1837 Caroline case and subsequent correspondence between then-U.S. Secretary of\n⁶⁹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK 4 (2007) [hereinafter U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK]; see also YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION AND SELF-DEFENCE (4th ed. 2005).\n⁷⁰ U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 69.\n⁷¹ Id. at 6.\n⁷² Id.\n98 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nState Daniel Webster and his British Foreign Office counterpart Lord Ashburton.\"73 Secretary Webster informed Lord Ashburton that a state can act in self-defense when the circumstances are \"instantaneous, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation.\"74 The attributes of cyberspace, especially speed and lethality, seem quite similar to Secretary Webster's factors. Essentially, if a state is fortunate enough to develop information about a developing or planned cyberspace attack against it, the attributes of cyberspace may compel a state to act in its best interest and exercise anticipatory self-defense.\nThe follow-on question involves what a state can do in self-defense, i.e. how is the principle of proportional response applied in and through cyberspace? In cyberspace, there may be a number of ways to technically counter an attack. A state could disconnect itself from cyberspace. However, such a response seems disproportionately burdensome on the victim state and could cause other forms of harm internally. The victim state could quickly counter with anti-virus measures, although such efforts are always a game of \"catch-up.\" The victim state could respond by disconnecting all cyberspace connections with the aggressor state. However, this will only work as long as the aggressor state chooses not to attack through another state. Moreover, such actions require attribution.\nBecause a state needs to know against which state to exercise self-defense, developing reliable attribution represents another difficulty with applying age-old laws and methods to cyberspace. Given that a cyberspace attack comes from another country and could involve communications \"hopping\" through several other countries, it is nearly impossible for a state to develop attribution without first violating the cyberspace infrastructure and jurisdiction of other states. Currently, to avoid violating another state's cyberspace, states send requests for assistance to cooperating states. The victim state requests help in developing information about the IP address in question and also requests monitoring of that IP address, allowing the state to \"hop back\" to the next IP address, and then request more help. This \"hopping back\" process can be painful and long, leaving the victim state vulnerable. However, the traditional police doctrine of hot pursuit is expanding in international law. Under customary international law, ships and planes can follow offending vessels in hot pursuit up to another state's territorial sea or airspace.75 However, the European Union has adopted the Schengen Agreement that permits law enforcement officials to cross state borders when pursuing a criminal suspected of certain serious\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 99\n73 Id.\n74 Id.\n75 Id. at 541.\noffenses⁷⁶ The agreement provides that the pursuing officers will cease their pursuit upon request of the other state, however, the pursuing officers can request that the other state arrest the suspect.⁷⁷\nExtending the principles of the Schengen Agreement to the domain of cyberspace seems logical, because attacks in cyberspace are analogous to serious criminal offenses. Permitting hot pursuit is consistent with the proposed definition’s efforts to deter states from knowingly acquiescing to cyberspace attacks. Witting host states will find it much harder to hide in the shadow of attribution. Providing victim states with a legal “hot pursuit” capability, including proper coordination mechanisms, will be invaluable to promoting cooperation, reducing crime, and deterring attacks in and through cyberspace.\nWith the ability to more quickly attribute attacks, a state would then have other options to consider under the principle of proportionate response. The victim state could consider firing back in self-defense with a cyberspace weapon at the actual computer(s) used to attack it. This can be reasonably effective if a limited number of computers are involved.⁷⁸ However, a victim state will likely remain concerned, due to its limited ability to determine whether more attacks or attacks of increasing severity will follow the initial round of attacks. This challenge may lead a state to consider more serious measures, such as responding with a self-defense attack that involves disrupting a substantial portion of the witting host state’s cyberspace. However, the collateral damage from such a self-defense action could be substantial. The questions of necessity and anticipatory self-defense also affect the proportionality decision. Moreover, nothing prohibits states from defending against a cyberspace attack by using kinetic weapons, such as striking a key communication node with a cruise missile or damaging a state’s communication satellite(s). The hypotheticals and the potential for conflict abound. Thus, the unique nature of cyberspace and the inability to clearly apply current international laws, norms, and practices make resolution of conflict extremely difficult, and should inspire states to seek a framework of cooperation and deterrence, such as the one I advocate in this article.\n100 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# V. LOOKING FORWARD AND CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\nThe definitions proposed in this article provide a framework for consistency and an opportunity to level the playing field of international law. Today, states can either choose to continue with the status quo, or, recognizing the benefits of the peaceful use of cyberspace, embrace the need for clear definitions of cyberspace weapon and cyberspace attack. Embracing the definitions I propose would, at most, have a moderate impact on how international affairs are conducted today. The Schengen Agreement and the E.U. Convention on Cybercrime serve as models to build a framework of cooperation to promote peace and reduce crime. States would need to establish cyberspace communications centers, whereby each state would agree to pass information to another state as soon as it became aware of a cyberspace attack against a victim state, but is currently unable to halt the attack from affecting the victim state.⁷⁹ The centers would also coordinate the hot pursuit issues related to developing attribution.\nThose states that choose not to adopt the proposed legal definitions and methods of cooperation would do so knowing that their actions or inaction could be viewed as a cyberspace attack. Each state would still continue to exercise its right of self-defense. Meanwhile, the international community could apply the new legal standard when considering whether to apply sanctions. The end result is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack with cooperative application under international law could make a powerful form of asymmetric warfare untenable before it develops into an arms race that leads to increased conflicts and harms people and property.\nWhen our predecessors developed the law of conflict management it is doubtful anyone could foresee the day when a state could attack another state simply by manipulating electronic data. Even the futuristic Buck Rogers and lasers still had visible, kinetic-like effects. Today, one must recognize that the lack of specific definitions for “weapon” and “armed attack” create an untenable vacuum in the evolving domain of cyberspace. So far, only the criminal law has provided thorough definitions in an attempt to keep pace with the development of nefarious tools in cyberspace. The criminal law methodology provides a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt such definitions to the various uses of prohibited cyberspace tools. The field of international law requires similar flexibility. This article attempted to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon from the criminal law’s efforts to specifically define the acts caused by cyberspace criminals. The\n⁷⁹ A state could of course provide the information to the potential victim state, even if they were able to halt the attack before it caused harm. This extra level of cooperation would assist all states in developing their capabilities to detect potential cyberspace attacks.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 101\ncriminal law methodology facilitated the development of a definition of a cyberspace attack. By applying the current international law framework to the proposed definition of an armed attack in cyberspace, this article highlighted how such a definition could lead to parity in cyberspace and thereby promote peace through deterrence.\n102 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64"

INTRODUCTION\nChange has come and gone. While academics have been discussing methods to define the use of force in cyberspace, governments and policy makers may have missed an opportunity to shape the law of war. Just like a child “pinching” a peppermint from the candy store while the owner was not looking, someone may have successfully launched two cyberspace attacks, and no one called either one an unlawful use of force or armed attack. Did a state actor set a precedent that could become part of customary international law?\nEvery day there are new stories and developments about the increasing connectivity of people around the world spurred by the continued fast pace of technological developments in the computer and communications industries. Military applications of cyberspace are also rapidly evolving, moving the domain of cyberspace to the front lines of conflicts. But, the legal frameworks that regulate war or armed conflict are lagging far behind the technological changes that have already occurred. Today, cyberspace is seamless and transcends international boundaries at the speed of light. Unfortunately, law, especially international law, failed to keep pace with the new applications of existing technologies.³ On the criminal front, law enforcement agencies are swamped with allegations ranging from identity theft to theft of corporate data, while armed with only a marginally effective process to investigate, extradite, and prosecute international cyberspace criminals. However, the conduct of military operations in and through cyberspace, with potentially greater global implications, is bypassing the currently inadequate mire of international law. What if international law could provide a framework capable of enabling deterrence in cyberspace?\n¹ U.S.-CHINA ECON. &amp; SEC.

Meanwhile, commercial internet service providers began offering services in the late 1980’s. Today, according to Wikipedia, there are more than 1 billion personal computers in use and more than 1 billion users of the internet. Wikipedia, Personal Computer, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer (last visited Mar. 15, 2009).\n\nScholars have written many articles regarding cyberspace attacks in the international regime and what constitutes a use of force or act of war in cyberspace.⁴ Yet, there is no consensus regarding how to define attacks in cyberspace under international law. The unique qualities of operations in cyberspace will make this the most difficult domain in which to resolve international disputes and conflict. In this article, I intend to offer a new methodology for determining armed attacks in cyberspace by using existing criminal law legal tools. Specifically, this methodology will borrow from the criminal law’s definitions of cyberspace crimes, in order to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon. More importantly, by defining cyberspace weapon, this methodology will enable the international community to define what constitutes a cyberspace attack. Providing the legal framework for a definition of cyberspace attack, such as the new methodology outlined in this article, will serve to reduce the potential for conflict in cyberspace.\nThe article will first examine cyberspace and how current approaches have attempted to apply international law to armed attacks in cyberspace. Looking through the lens of current international laws will highlight how the unique attributes of cyberspace could increase the likelihood of international conflict. The article will identify how the failure of international law to define armed attacks and weapons further exacerbates this problem. The article will then transition from current international laws to examine whether current criminal law definitions and methodologies can fill the gap and provide realistic definitions of weapons and armed attacks in cyberspace. Lastly, the article will put these proposed definitions to the test against the most challenging aspects of cyberspace: attribution and espionage.\n⁴ See, e.g., Michael N.

APPLYING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBERSPACE ATTACKS: FALLING SHORT WITHOUT DEFINITIONS ## A. What is Cyberspace?\nFor the purposes of this article, I define cyberspace as *an evolving man-made domain for the organization and transfer of data using various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The domain is a combination of private and public property governed by technical rule sets designed primarily to facilitate the flow of information.*⁵ The key feature of cyberspace is that it is a man-made domain designed to transfer data and information.\nInformation is the reason cyberspace exists, and this feature makes current discussions involving the international law of conflict management, *jus ad bellum*, so different from traditional *jus ad bellum* discussions. Simply put, information is fundamentally different than the traditional tools of war; bits and bytes bear no physical resemblance to bullets and bombs. Michael Schmitt noted that cyberspace threats differ in four ways from traditional threats: (1) computer networks are a new target category, with computer network attacks capable of providing the same results as striking the traditional target with a kinetic weapon; (2) an attack does not have to use kinetic force and can solely involve a command from one computer to the target system; (3) the intended results are often not kinetic and could simply involve the manipulation of data or disruption of a service; and (4) cyberspace threats are not constrained by political boundaries or geography.⁶ I would add four more distinguishing factors between cyberspace threats and traditional or kinetic uses of force: (1) cyberspace attacks can be completed literally at the speed of light; (2) the results of some cyberspace attacks, whether intended or not, can be similar to those involving weapons of mass destruction;⁷ (3) the cost of acquiring the equipment and expertise to conduct operations in --- ⁵ This definition was developed jointly with my cyberspace law cohort, Major Noah Bledstein at 8 AF/JA. Major Bledstein has been working on cyberspace law issues since 2003. His assistance in discussing and developing the ideas and definitions in this paper was invaluable. It does not specifically address the issue of whether some part or all of cyberspace should be considered a global commons.\n⁶ Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, supra note 4, at 888.\n⁷ Because the infrastructure of modern societies relies on the technology and data which can be easily targeted during a cyberspace operation, the disabling of such infrastructure or manipulation of data could cause substantial damage and harm to a society. For example: disabling air traffic control systems or the systems which control the water flowing from a large dam, manipulating the data relied upon by banks or the International Monetary Fund, or manipulating the DNA coding for the subsequent year’s flu vaccine.\ncyberspace is *de minimis* in comparison to fielding conventional forces; and (4) attributing the attack to the responsible party and determining whether the attack was intentional or accidental is extremely difficult.⁸ The attribution problem, which this article discusses throughout, is indeed the elusive factor that most severely complicates the application of international law. In fact, the attribution problem makes cyberspace so different from other mediums or domains that it requires an entirely new international law approach. The unique nature of the cyber domain impacts not only national level decisions but also the development of law in this area, as evidenced by the current state of law regarding cyberspace and conflict management, which is discussed below.\n## B. Current Legal Approaches to Cyberspace Attacks The majority of scholars considering attacks in cyberspace have used an ambiguous, effects-based analytical approach relying on international law to determine what constitutes a “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter or whether an “armed attack” occurred under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.⁹ The discussions and articles have also looked to other treaties that comprise international law and the law of war, such as the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions. On first impression, an effects-based approach to the issue that relies on ⁸ A nuance of limited attribution is that much of the public is unaware of what is going on in cyberspace. In the other domains where military operations are conducted, the activities are much more visible. However, in cyberspace, we can’t easily spot electrons and data packets whisking by us or through a phone line.\n⁹ *See supra* note 4. A brief description of two of the leading approaches follows: First, Gary Sharp’s approach recognizes that a use of force in cyberspace may rise to the threshold of an armed attack, depending on its “scope, duration, and intensity,” which are factors previously relied upon by the United States (*See infra* note 28). Mr. Sharp suggests relying upon an analysis of how states have responded in previous cases to help analyze whether an unlawful use of force or armed attack have occurred, essentially relying on a normative analysis. Mr. Sharp summarizes his test by stating: “What constitutes a use of force of a scope, duration, and intensity that constitutes an armed attack and triggers the law of armed conflict is a question of fact that must be subjectively analyzed in each and every case in the context of all relevant law and circumstances.” SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 69. Michael Schmitt’s analytical approach involves six factors which are used to “délimit” economic/political coercion from determining what is a use of armed force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Mr. Schmitt’s premise for using an effects based approach primarily rests with his assessment that the U.N. Charter was not directly focused on outlawing “force” but rather the “deleterious consequences” of state actions, and outlawing uses of force under Article 2 was a “prescriptive short-hand to achieve their goals.” Schmitt, *Computer Network Attack*, *supra* note 4, at 911. I would recommend that all practitioners in this area read both works. Mr. Sharp’s book is especially invaluable as a thorough review of international law that applies to cyberspace operations.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 69 international law seems to make sense, since it is electromagnetic data that moves through cyberspace and then creates an electromagnetic effect at the terminating point. The actors certainly focus on what effects they can achieve in and through cyberspace. These effects-based approaches add considerable value to the discussion of the issue, but they are unnecessarily constrained by relying primarily on legal documents and customary international norms developed before the advent of mass-produced computers.\nThe only substantial international legal document developed to address issues related to cyberspace is the European Union's Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰ (Cybercrime Convention). While the Cybercrime Convention does not address cyberspace attacks as possible acts of war and instead focuses on criminal acts, it does help establish a framework for a new methodology of analyzing cyberspace attacks. Instead of focusing on the end result of a cyberspace event, the effects, and trying to determine whether such an act is a use of force or armed attack under international law, a criminal law methodology places increased emphasis on the genesis of a cyberspace event. The criminal law approach thus focuses on defining the beginning of a cyberspace event and not the effects, and those definitions can then be applied to international law and military operations in cyberspace.\nBefore discussing the benefits of the criminal law approach, however, one must first understand how most commentators are currently applying international law to actions in cyberspace. A review of current scholarship on this issue will show the difficulty in applying decades old terms and norms to actions in cyberspace. As a starting point, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”¹¹ However, without international sanctions there is little incentive for a party to comply with Article 2(4)’s peaceful objectives.¹² The ¹⁰ Convention on Cybercrime, Nov. 23, 2001, 2296 U.N.T.S. 167, available at http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm.\n¹¹ U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 ¹² Id. Art. 1 of the Charter states the purpose of the Charter. Subparagraph 1 specifically states: To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.\n\nhistorical reality is that most state actors have not conducted themselves as though they feared some form of international punishment for their actions. By itself, Article 2(4) seems, therefore, to create very little deterrent effect in conflict management.\nHowever, in contrast to Article 2(4), Article 51 permits parties to act in self-defense in response to an “armed attack.”¹³ Pragmatically, this right of self-defense can have the quickest success at reducing illegal uses of force constituting breaches of the peace, thereby increasing the deterrent effect of international law.¹⁴ While it is important to analyze whether a state action is a threat or use of force, the more critical question is whether the action is an armed attack, authorizing the recipient to respond in self-defense? The right of self-defense puts other states on notice that their offensive actions could be met with military force.\nThe right of self-defense has historically been limited by the reality that smaller nation states would respond against bigger and more powerful states with conventional force only if an attack truly jeopardized its national survival.¹⁵ This could be called the “bully dilemma” of international law.¹⁶ The “bully dilemma” pragmatically disenfranchises smaller and weaker states from the protection of Article 51. If a “bully” state engages in a small-scale breach of the peace against a significantly smaller state that smaller state will likely ¹³ Mr. Sharp reasons “a state never loses its right to use force in self-defense in response to a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4), however, the right of self-defense under customary international law may not always justify an armed response.” Mr. Sharp recognizes that his position may not be held by all and that any right of self-defense is limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity. SHARP, supra note 4, at 48-49.\n¹⁴ When there is a threat or use of force under Article 2, the United Nations can impose sanctions, to include armed intervention under Chapter 7. However, building the consensus for such actions often takes considerable time and debate, while the victims of such use of force wait for relief. Even the liberation of Kuwait took more than six months before U.N. authorized forces began significant operations to remove Iraqi forces.\n¹⁵ For example, when the United States launched cruise missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan in August 1998, neither country responded with conventional force. The codename for the operation was “Infinite Reach.” What if Sudan had then possessed a capability to respond in cyberspace? How could Sudan respond in cyberspace, and would the U.S. have countered, if attribution could be obtained?\n¹⁶ Mr. Sharp, on page 52 of CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE, supra note 4, concluded the third chapter of his book by stating “[t]here is no black and white, mechanical rule in the law of conflict management that clearly defines what a use of force is under all circumstances.” He then followed that statement by using the opposite of the “bully dilemma” to demonstrate his conclusion that a use of force is a question of fact which must be subjectively analyzed: “For example, a state’s activity that is lawful against another state of equal size may nevertheless be significant enough against a smaller state to cross Article 2(4)’s ‘political independence’ threshold.” A subjective “size matters” approach to law provides no clarity and leaves smaller states wondering whether they can seek international assistance or defend themselves.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 71 acquiesce to the aggression. The smaller state will likely determine that it is better to suffer outright defeat than to attempt to stop the aggression and fail. Meanwhile, as noted above, sanctions under the U.N. Charter are rarely invoked against the “bully” state, especially when the “bully” state is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and therefore holds a veto.\nHowever, in contrast to the historical “bully dilemma,” as depicted above, the asymmetric nature of operations in cyberspace now allows any party to possess the capability to swiftly act in self-defense with incredible lethality. The “bully” could soon be extinct and a new era of conflict could unfold, where the appearance of parity could inspire more breaches of the peace.¹⁷ This is why the development of law in this area must move forward.\n## C. Looking to Jus in Bello to Define Armed Attack The potential lethality of cyberspace responses and unique attributes of cyberspace should compel international lawyers to consider the right of self-defense against cyberspace attacks in light of both the *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum*. Beginning with *jus in bello*, the focus of the examination is whether the current laws and definitions provide sufficient clarity to help nation states resolve what is an armed attack in cyberspace. Unfortunately, international law fails to define “armed attack”. The Geneva Conventions and additional documents relating to the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), *jus in bello*, do provide definitions of related terms that can clarify what international law would likely consider an armed attack. The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols are “not a separate paradigm of conflict management,” but are focused on *jus in bello* issues.¹⁸ Article 49 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I) defines “attack” as “acts of violence against the ¹⁷ To use a college football analogy, the spread of the “West Coast Offense” to many universities has resulted in non-traditional powerhouse programs rising up and defeating Goliaths of the gridiron. Boise State University’s BCS victory over the University of Oklahoma highlights how smaller teams with allegedly lower quality recruits can use a new method of attack to level the playing field. In cyberspace operations, what is to stop a small nation state from responding with a non-attributable cyberspace operation in response to perceived threats or incursions by a “bullying” superpower? Even if the smaller state is questioned, it could respond that it is acting in self-defense to what it considered an armed attack with necessary actions to protect it from further harm. Such an asymmetric shift in warfare could result in an increasing number of “cyberspace conflicts” much like the low intensity conflicts of the 1980s. However, the capacity for “cyberspace conflicts” to rapidly escalate in lethality, due to self-defense actions, could be an incentive for nation states to instead look for a model that promotes deterrence.\n¹⁸ SHARP, *supra* note 4, at 77.\n\nadversary.\"¹⁹ The official commentary for Protocol I further adds that the definition “refers simply to the use of armed force to carry out a military operation.”²⁰ Note that because this definition requires the use of armed force, non-military personnel hacking into the New York Stock Exchange and causing substantial economic harm would not be an attack.²¹ Such an application identifies practical limitations with the current definition in Article 49.\nCommon Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions states that the Conventions shall apply during “any other armed conflict,” yet that term is not well defined in the conventions.²² The official commentary to Common Article 2 helps in understanding what is an armed conflict and states that “de facto hostilities” are sufficient. The commentary then makes clear the Conventions’ intention for a low threshold and broad application of the term “armed conflict”: The substitution of this much more general expression for the word\"war\"was deliberate. One may argue almost endlessly about the legal definition of\"war.\"A ¹⁹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/470?OpenDocument. The United States has not ratified Protocol I, but it is accepted as customary international law. It is interesting to note that Article 49 further states: [The] provisions of this section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.\n*Id.* International law recognizes distinctions with regard to conducting hostilities in the domains of air and sea, yet there is no strong movement for international recognition of the distinctive qualities of the domain of cyberspace.\n²⁰ Commentary for Protocol I, art. 49, para. 1882, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=470&amp;t=com.\n²¹ Even in 1977, international law failed to grasp the importance of economic battles that could bring a country to its knees.\n²² The four Geneva Conventions were signed on 12 August 1949. Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3114, 75 U.N.T.S. 31; Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3217, 75 U.N.T.S. 85; Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135; Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 75 U.N.T.S. 287. The Conventions and their commentaries are available on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) web page at: http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView. The Geneva Conventions represent customary international law with regard to the conduct of armed hostilities or *jus in bello*.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 73 State can always pretend, when it commits a hostile act against another State, that it is not making war, but merely engaging in a police action, or acting in legitimate self-defence. The expression\"armed conflict\"makes such arguments less easy. Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, or how much slaughter takes place.²³ In addition to the above statement, each of the four commentaries to the Geneva Conventions provides slightly different amplifying language for Article 2. This is, no doubt, due to the specific context of each of the four Geneva Conventions. For example, with respect to the First Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, the Commentary adds: The respect due to human personality is not measured by the number of victims. Nor, incidentally, does the application of the Convention necessarily involve the intervention of cumbrous machinery. It all depends on circumstances. If there is only a single wounded person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended....²⁴ ²³ Commentary to Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions. The quoted language is repeated in paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of each of the four Geneva Conventions. Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/365-570005?OpenDocument; Commentary for Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/370-580005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590005?OpenDocument; Commentary to Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 2, para. 1, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600005?OpenDocument.\n²⁴ Id. Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Geneva Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, Aug. 12 1949, provides almost identical language, with a minor distinction regarding shipwrecked persons: “If there is only a single shipwrecked person as a result of the conflict, the Convention will have been applied as soon as he has been collected and tended....” Paragraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Thus, what is clear from the Commentaries regarding when an “armed conflict” has occurred is not the number or persons involved or whether the parties are using “cumbrous machinery”, such as tanks, rockets, planes, etc., or “even if there has been no fighting,” but simply whether there is “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces.” Further, a consistent theme is that “armed conflict” usually involves some sort of negative impact on at least one person, even if it is a civilian victim. The Commentary language begs the question—a question not answered—what is “intervention of the armed forces?”\nIn sum, this discussion of the Geneva Conventions as they relate to *jus in bello* reveals that “armed conflict” is an activity that involves acts of violence between armed forces, which affect at least one person, regardless of the amount of damage or suffering inflicted. Overall, the threshold is quite low and certainly does not require significant damage or loss of life. The policy concern to protect people from the harsh effects of conflict most likely inspired such a low, almost bright-line approach. While the definitions and Official Commentaries of the Conventions help explore the issue, the U.N. Charter remains the principal document for analyzing *jus ad bellum* issues relevant to the armed attack determination.\n## D. Armed Attack and Jus ad Bellum Unfortunately, the U.N. Charter itself provides very little by way of definition when it comes to the term, “armed attack.” Moreover, no official commentary addresses the issue. However, one place scholars have turned for clarification is the U.N. General Assembly’s 1974 resolution defining aggression, Resolution Number 3314. In that resolution, the General Assembly defined aggression as the “use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12 1949, provides the following minor distinction: It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces; it suffices for the armed forces of one Power to have captured adversaries falling within the scope of Article 4. Even if there has been no fighting, the fact that persons covered by the Convention are detained is sufficient for its application. The number of persons captured in such circumstances is, of course, immaterial.\nParagraph 1 of the commentary for Article 2 of the Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War simply clarifies with regard to civilians that the “respect due to the human person as such is not measured by the number of victims.”\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 75 political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\"²⁵ More importantly, the resolution provides a number of specific acts that constitute aggression, including, but not limited to: Invasion, attack or military occupation; bombardment or the use of any weapons against a State; blockade; an attack on the land, sea, or air forces or the marine and air fleets of a State; and the sending of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries to complete any of the previous acts.²⁶ The resolution states that it may limit a finding of aggression in light of relevant circumstances, such as when the act is not of\"sufficient gravity.\"The pragmatic tone of this qualifying language is more consistent with how nation states subjectively conclude whether an armed attack occurred.²⁷ The term\"sufficient gravity\"may be an unintended endorsement of the\"bully dilemma.\"Thus, the\"bully\"state again avoids accountability when the international community determines its small-scale aggression is not of\"sufficient gravity,\"i.e. the international community is not sufficiently concerned about their own safety and security. Unfortunately, subjective conclusions do not add much clarity to resolving what acts would be considered an armed attack in cyberspace. As noted above, such definitional clarity is essential to aiding all states in understanding which acts in cyberspace can result in self-defense actions. If there was a legal framework, which created a clearer understanding of one's accountability in cyberspace, there would be a greater likelihood of deterring states from acting ²⁵ G. A. Res. 3314, U.N. GAOR, 29th Sess., art. 1 (Dec. 14, 1974) available at http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/29/ares29.htm. This language is almost identical to the language found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n²⁶ Id. art. 3.\n²⁷ Mr. Sharp accurately notes that the United States uses the factors of scope, duration and intensity to determine whether de facto hostilities exist, but notes that the application has been inconsistent. When a Navy A-6 crew was shot down over Syria in 1983 and one of the crew members was captured, the U.S. claimed POW status for Lt Goodman and stated that “‘armed conflict’ includes any situation in which there is hostile action between the armed forces of two parties, regardless of the duration, intensity or scope of the fighting.” (emphasis added by this author) This is contrasted with the later U.S. position regarding the status of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant as an unlawful detainee, since the U.N. operations in Somalia “did not rise to the level of de facto international armed conflict.” SHARP, supra note 4, at 61-62. Essentially, Mr. Sharp’s position is that the U.S. position has evolved and now relies on the conjunctive “and” when applying the three factors of scope, duration, and intensity, versus the disjunctive “or.”\n\naggressively in cyberspace, because they would know which acts could result in a cyberspace self-defense action.²⁸ Whether one looks to the “Schmitt analysis” using six factors or Sharp’s approach of “heuristic analysis” to develop a profile of how states apply the factors of scope, duration, and intensity to the U.N. Charter and Common Article 2 framework, there appears to be no clear answer in contemporary international law. Mr. Sharp, quoting Ian Brownlie, attempted to illustrate how international law can be applied during an international incident: “the minor nature of an attack” helps to prove the “intention to attack, of honest mistake, or simply the limited objectives of an attack.”²⁹ Brownlie’s observation made sense in the days of conventional weapons and minor border skirmishes or incursions. One or two shots fired by a border guard versus dropping two 1,000 pound bombs can circumstantially help determine intent. Generally, with such kinetic attacks, the first or second order effects are readily discernable. However, warfare has changed and a new domain has evolved.\nIn cyberspace, what may appear as a “minor attack” could evolve into something much more destructive to a nation state, taking days or months to cause observable, significant harm. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks, and cyberspace attacks are quite different from the traditional methods of massing forces and building up logistics trains and lines of communication. States can much more easily identify preparation for a kinetic invasion versus a cyberspace onslaught. Asymmetric warfare may require asymmetric application of the law to provide the clarity and enforceability capable of promoting peace. The development of international law related to activities in cyberspace should not be delayed any longer.³⁰ And why is finding a legally clear answer so difficult? In his writing, Sharp recognizes the concerns with a strict interpretation of Common Article 2, since such a “rote” application of the Article 2 threshold “intentionally causes military personnel to become belligerents and lawful targets even though they are conducting a peacetime military operation.”³¹ Sharp’s concern regarding a strict ²⁸ Recall the conclusion of supra note 17 regarding how the asymmetric nature of cyberspace warfare could result in an increasing number of conflicts, all with the potential of having substantially greater effects than traditional low intensity conflicts. This asymmetric nature has created a potential deterrence vacuum, which the law must attempt to fill and states must then enforce.\n²⁹ SHARP, supra note 4, at 66 (quoting IAN BROWNLEIE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES, 366 (1954)).\n³⁰ I refer the reader to the two lead-off quotes at the beginning of this article. The lack of clear, enforceable law will only embolden activities in cyberspace and increase international tension and the likelihood of substantial physical damage in addition to the on-going intellectual carnage.\n³¹ SHARP, supra note 4, at 65-66.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 77 application of Common Article 2 to *jus ad bellum*, conflict management, is certainly justified with regard to the evolution of conventional military activities, such as peacekeeping and peacemaking.\nCyberspace operations, however, do not create the same concerns related to peacekeeping operations. There has been no move to create a U.N. “cyberspace peacekeeping force” to engage in online actions to enforce U.N. resolutions or sanctions, and cyberspace forces are not conducting humanitarian missions. In addition, neither Common Article 2, the U.N. Charter, nor the U.N. definition of aggression are contemporary enough to be strictly applied to activities in cyberspace, since they lack definitions applicable to the unique methods used in cyberspace operations. Nevertheless, the policy objective and low threshold of Common Article 2 provide hope that international law is capable of applying a stricter, definition-based approach to cyberspace attacks. The need for a legally clear answer should help shift the focus from an ambiguous, effects-based approach that relies solely on international law to the development of a definition-based approach capable of consistent application to cyberspace operations that affect other states.\n## E. Weapons are the Key The U.N. General Assembly’s defined aggression to include the use of “any weapons” against another state. The use of such a clearly broad term as “any” logically implies that the use of even minor weapons against a state could be considered an act of aggression, if the circumstances are of “sufficient gravity.” Leaving aside the inevitably ambiguous discussion of events that may be of “sufficient gravity” in the eyes of the U.N. General Assembly, the General Assembly’s inclusion of the use of weapons in its definition of aggression brings the discussion regarding armed attacks in cyberspace back to the initial proposal of analyzing cyberspace attacks using the criminal law model.\nThe criminal law model’s reliance on clear definitions requires us to focus on the causative event, versus emphasizing the effects. For example, a crime is committed when a person fires a gun toward another, regardless of whether the other person is actually struck by a bullet. The minimum crime is some type of assault, likely an aggravated one, in the absence of a legal defense. If the person is struck by the bullet (effect of attack) or other circumstances are developed to indicate a more serious intent, then the chargeable crimes range from aggravated assault to murder. As this example demonstrates, under a criminal law approach, a crime (attack) occurred under all of the factual variations. The increase in harm (effect) only increases the level of punishment the offender may face from society and does not influence whether a crime of some sort occurred.\n\nRegardless of the severity of the crime (attack), societies have long recognized the policy interest in taking measures to respond to and deter crimes. This deterrence objective is a philosophical difference between a criminal law approach and an effects-based approach relying on international law. International law, relying upon an effects-based threshold, is implicated only when an incident’s consequences rise above a certain threshold. Whereas the criminal law model reacts even if there is just an attempt to commit a prohibited act. Thus, a criminal law approach focuses on the actual act and the method used, whether accessing a computer without proper authorization or robbing a bank with a gun. Relying on the criminal law approach allows one to examine the genesis of an attack at an even deeper level. The criminal law approach strives to provide clarity and consistency, allowing all members of a society to know what conduct is prohibited, which also serves the additional objective of deterrence. In the case of defining cyberspace attacks, a consideration of cyberspace weapons is the key to providing such clarity.\nThe use of a weapon of some kind is the true genesis of an attack. In fact, the types of weapons available to a state determine the possible attack methodologies.³² Thus, studying weapons is also important to understanding the strategy of potential adversaries. However, for the purpose of providing clarity to the issue of armed attacks in cyberspace, the definition of what is a weapon in cyberspace becomes the foundational question to developing a new approach to international law affecting cyberspace operations.\nWhile the U.N. General Assembly used the term “any weapon” and provided no further definition of what constitutes a weapon, one can turn to the law of armed conflict (LOAC) for assistance. Based on the LOAC’s specific guidance regarding conventional tools of war, conventional militaries tend to have a practical understanding of what are lawful and unlawful weapons. For example, exploding bullets and poisonous gas are unlawful weapons.³³ The LOAC focuses, however, almost completely on kinetic weapons.\nDespite its narrow focus on kinetic weapons, the LOAC has nevertheless struggled to define a “weapon,” and there is currently no ³² For example, possessing and being able to field deep strike kinetic weapons such as low observable bombers opens up a range of options for a state actor. Likewise, possessing and being willing to use suicide bombers or biological weapons creates a tactical (asymmetric) advantage over adversaries. Thus, being able to conduct operations in cyberspace creates a new line of attack methods.\n³³ Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Oct. 18, 1907, art. 23, available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/195?OpenDocument [hereinafter Hague Regulation (IV)]. Article 23 outlaws weapons that cause unnecessary suffering. See also Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, Geneva, June 17, 1925.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 79 accepted definition under international law. Instead, Article 36 of Protocol I requires a review of any “new weapon, means or method of warfare” to ensure its use would comply with international law.³⁴ Although the United States has not ratified Protocol I, customary international law requires the review of weapons.³⁵ The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has noted that each state tends to have its own definition of “weapon.”³⁶ Even within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) there is no standard definition of “weapon.”³⁷ Thus, each service developed its own definition of weapon, which it uses to determine whether a means or method of warfare requires a legal review in accordance with Article 36 of Protocol I. In the Air Force, paragraph 1 of Air Force Instruction 51-402, Weapons Review, 13 May 1994, defines weapons as “devices designed to kill, injure, or disable people, or to damage or destroy property.” The definition specifically excludes “electronic warfare devices.” The definition also differentiates between effects on people and effects on property, failing to include devices that “disable” property. Meanwhile, the United States Army and Navy each provide a definition of weapon that specifically includes devices that “disable” property.³⁸ Thus, the Army and Navy definitions appear to be more ³⁴ Throughout the remainder of the discussion, the term “weapon” will be used in lieu of the broader term, “weapon, means or method of warfare.”\n³⁵ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONS LAW DIV., OFFICE OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL, DEP’T OF THE AIR FORCE, AIR FORCE OPERATIONS &amp; THE LAW 25, 48 (1st ed. 2002).

However, according to page 9 of the ICRC GUIDE ON NEW WEAPONS, supra note 36, the DOD Law of War Working Group proposed a definition which included “all arms, munitions, materiel, instruments, mechanisms, or devices that have an intended effect of injuring, damaging, destroying or disabling personnel or property.”\n³⁸ U.S. DEP’T OF ARMY, REG. 27-53, REVIEW OF LEGALITY OF WEAPONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, para. 3.a. (1 Jan. 1979), defines a weapon as: “Chemical weapons and all conventional arms, munitions, materiel, instruments, mechanisms, or devices which have an intended effect of injuring, destroying, or disabling enemy personnel, materiel, or property.” U.S. DEP’T OF NAVY, SEC’Y OF THE NAVY INSTR. 5000.2C, IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION OF THE DEFENSE ACQUISITION SYSTEM AND THE JOINT CAPABILITIES INTEGRATION AND DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM, para. 2.6.2 (19 Nov. 2004) defines a weapon as: “all arms, munitions, materiel, instruments, mechanisms, devices, closely aligned with the foreseeable type of military operations that could occur in cyberspace, i.e. operations that disable or destroy systems by manipulating or corrupting the data relied upon by the system.\n## III. THE KEY TO THIS PUZZLE: CYBERSPACE WEAPONS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW DEFINITION-BASED MODEL ### A. Defining Cyberspace Weapons The criminal law approach and methodology help resolve the issues of ambiguity, enforceability, and attribution for two reasons. First, it provides strong definitions that can withstand judicial scrutiny and allow for fair application to a variety of fact patterns. A nuance of this first strength is that criminal law definitions must also clearly put everyone on notice as to prohibited activities. The second strength is that the criminal law methodology requires the definition of a prohibited act to have some degree of intent, also known as the scienter element. Relying on these strengths, the criminal law approach creates a definition of a cyberspace crime that is clear, flexible, and requires a minimum level of intent. The criminal law methodology will then enable us to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace crime in order to establish the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nAs noted earlier, the European Union’s Convention on Cybercrime is an international treaty intended to create consistency in criminal laws related to internet activities. Unfortunately, the Cybercrime Convention does not offer a definition of malicious logic or cyberspace weapon. Instead, the Cybercrime Convention identifies specific activities states should criminalize. Logically, the reason to prohibit certain activities is to avoid unwanted effects. The criminal law methodology is able to transform unwanted effects into specific definitions and prohibitions, whereas the current approach under international humanitarian law relies on an ambiguous analysis of facts using undefined prohibitions.\nThe intent of the Cybercrime Convention was to set up a basic framework whereby the parties agreed to create their own state criminal codes to address broadly defined prohibited activities. Because the Convention defines prohibited activities broadly, it does not provide the detailed definitions of actual effects in cyberspace necessary to specifically define a cyberspace weapon. Nevertheless, the Convention’s aspirational criminal law definitions of unlawful activity in cyberspace can help identify the international community’s thoughts Armed Attack in Cyberspace 81 regarding unlawful cyberspace effects and thus the weapons that cause those effects. By looking at what types of activities the Cybercrime Convention intends to criminalize, it is possible to reverse engineer the definition of a cyberspace weapon.\nSpecifically, the Cybercrime Convention provides that the parties will adopt laws that criminalize cyberspace crimes such as: unlawful access, unlawful interception, interfering with data or systems, and computer fraud or forgery.³⁹ Looking at the broad definitions for these offenses under the Cybercrime Convention, terms such as “obtaining,” “damaging,” “deleting,” “deteriorating,” “altering” or “suppressing” data represent a common theme of what happens to electromagnetic data when a cyberspace crime occurs.⁴⁰ This criminal law framework parallels the scenarios discussed by many others with regard to armed attacks in cyberspace. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense defines Computer Network Attack as: “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”⁴¹ Whether a cyberspace crime or a cyberspace attack, the goal is to affect someone else’s data, or use data to affect property.\nThe domain of cyberspace is obviously not as physically transparent as the domains of air and space. If one were to try and “fire” one million volts at a cyberspace target, there are too many information nodes, such as routers and switches, along the internet pathway that would become the unintended recipient of the “electromagnetic missile.” The one million volt “electromagnetic missile” would cause ³⁹ See Convention on Cybercrime, supra note 10, at arts. 2-8.\n⁴⁰ Id. arts. 4, 5. Article 4 provides: Data interference: 1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data without right. 2. A Party may reserve the right to require that the conduct described in paragraph 1 result in serious harm.\nArticle 5 provides: System interference: Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.\n⁴¹ JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUB. 1-02, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS 113 (17 Mar. 2009) [hereinafter JP 1-02].\n\ncollateral damage to those nodes and would be worn down long before it reached its intended target. Cyberspace attacks, just like criminal hacks, are designed to affect electromagnetic data in various ways, which then impact the adversary's cyberspace to create an operational advantage for the attacker. Thus, the basic legal framework of the Cybercrime Convention is beneficial in the context of military operations in cyberspace.\nAlthough the Cybercrime Convention does not provide definitions of key terms such as\"damaging\"or\"altering,\"the Cybercrime Convention points us to the criminal codes of party states, such as the United States, to specifically define the actus reus. The criminal code of the United States is considered for several reasons: the United States invented the internet; the United States is arguably the largest user of cyberspace; the United States is a leading prosecutor of cyberspace crimes; and many nations work with the United States to solve cyberspace crimes.\nSection 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes intentionally causing damage to a protected computer.[42] Section 1030 is often used by U.S. Attorneys to prosecute persons who steal or corrupt data located on computer systems and persons who engage in denial of service attacks. Section 1030 defines\"damage\"as\"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.\"This definition of\"damage\"recognizes the reality of what happens during a criminal hack or a cyberspace attack:\"damage\"in cyberspace does not require smashing, burning, or blowing things up. The U.S. Code provides a clear, judicially accepted and internationally recognized definition of damage in the cyberspace realm. By borrowing from this definition, it is possible to logically develop a definition of a cyberspace weapon, the key to the puzzle.[43] From the above, we see that in its most simple terms, the definition of a weapon is\"something that causes damage.\"Applying the definition of damage from Section 1030, I propose the following definition of a cyberspace weapon: Any capability, device, or combination of capabilities and techniques, which if used for its intended purpose, is likely to impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, or information located on a computer or information processing system.[44] Although the proposed definition uses the term Armed Attack in Cyberspace\n\n## B. Applying the Definition of a Cyberspace Weapon\nNow that we have defined cyberspace weapon, the remaining challenge is to determine whether the proposed definition works within the context of cyberspace operations and within the current limits of international law. While the first instances of negative code may not have been written with the intent of harming a computer, today the story is quite different. Today, the development of computer code that negatively impacts an information system has evolved and spread like an advanced, persistent plague. The tools of the modern hacker, whether criminal, military, terrorist, geek, or spy, are broadly referred to as malicious logic. While malicious logic can take many forms, the key question for our purposes is: “At what point does malicious logic become a cyberspace weapon, the use of which constitutes an armed attack under international law?” The first part of the question focuses not on the end result but on the “tool” used in cyberspace and whether that tool is a “weapon.” The second part of the question will focus on the weapon’s use in cyberspace.\nFirst, one must consider whether particular cyberspace “tools” constitute weapons under international law. The ICRC Commentary on Article 35 of Additional Protocol I states: “The words ‘methods and means’ include weapons in the widest sense, as well as the way in which they are used.”⁴⁶ Furthermore, the ICRC Guide on New Weapons expounds on the above commentary provision by noting that the legal\n⁴⁵ Again, recall that while the services’ definitions of weapon all used the term “disable,” JP 1-02, supra note 41, uses the term “degrade” when describing Computer Network Attack.\n⁴⁶ Commentary for Additional Protocol I, supra note 20, para. 1402 (for art. 35). Article 35 provides overarching guidance regarding the means and methods of warfare and reads:\nBasic rules - 1. In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. 2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. 3. It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.\nProtocol I, supra note 19, at art. 35.\n\nreview requirements of Article 36 apply even to non-lethal weapons based on “the ways in which these weapons are to be used pursuant to military doctrine, tactics, rules of engagement, operating procedures and countermeasures” and also applies to all acquired weapons, whether procured based on military specifications or “off-the shelf.”47 Both the Commentary and the ICRC guide conclude that the analysis regarding whether a weapon is lawful or unlawful should be focused on the weapon’s “normal or expected use.”48 Next, one must analyze how the proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon can be applied in the real-world context of two recent “cyberspace attacks” in Estonia and Georgia. Considering the realities of these two events, does the proposed definition provide sufficient clarity for use in international law?\nThe cyberspace event in April and May of 2007 in Estonia involved a number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) actions against the networks for the two largest banks, effectively severing all internet communications for two hours and causing partial interruptions thereafter.49 The event also included acts against an Estonian government internet service provider that “disrupted government communications for at least a short period of time.”50 Lastly, the web page for the Estonian Prime Minister was “defaced,” manipulating it to show an alleged apology for moving a Soviet World War II memorial.51 Clearly, the event in Estonia resulted in reduced availability and impaired the integrity of the information located on computer systems in Estonia. Applying the attacker’s methods to the proposed definition, it is clear these methods constituted “cyberspace weapons.”\nThe cyberspace event that occurred in July and August of 2008 in Georgia results in a similar conclusion. Again, a DDoS event targeted the website of the Georgian President, making it unavailable for 24 hours. Attackers also defaced the website with pictures of Adolf Hitler next to the image of the Georgian President, and, using malicious logic, caused websites for other government agencies to lose connectivity.52 Here again, the methods used by cyberspace attackers in Georgia caused a loss of access and impaired the integrity of the data. Consequently, it is appropriate to label these methods as “cyberspace weapons.” The proposed definition of a cyberspace weapon therefore Armed Attack in Cyberspace 85 provides the degree of clarity to move the discussion forward to defining a cyberspace attack.\n## C. When is the Use of a Cyberspace Weapon a Cyberspace Attack?\nAcknowledging that cyberspace weapons were used in the events in Estonia and Georgia does not answer the ultimate question of whether the acts should be considered armed attacks under international law? Here again, the temptation is to return to an effects-based analysis to answer the question. However, as noted at the beginning of this article, previous attempts to answer the question using such an analysis provide ambiguous answers at best. Instead, by applying a definition-based approach, much like the criminal law does, there is a higher likelihood of reaching a clear answer. Therefore, in order to determine when the use of a cyberspace weapon constitutes an “armed attack” under international law, one must look to how the cyberspace weapon is used rather than its effects.\nThis question of how a weapon is used is the key transitional point in this analytical approach and borrows substantially from the criminal law. For example, a gun can either be a weapon used to kill people or a weapon used to assist a hunter in gathering food. The intent of the user remains the primary issue under the criminal law. Using this criminal law approach will enable conversion of the above question into a definition applicable to the international law arena.\nTo prove an offense under the criminal law, almost all crimes require proof of *mens rea*, the idea of a criminal intent or purpose. Specifically, most crimes require proof of either specific or general intent or knowledge. The most difficult *mens rea* to prove is specific intent, whereas knowledge is much more easily inferred from the circumstances. Considering history and the unwillingness of state actors to admit their actual intent, proving the specific or general intent of a state actor is very difficult when relying on circumstantial evidence, and would therefore result in an unenforceable definition beneficial only to academic discussions.\nTherefore, because proof of knowledge is easier to prove than either a specific or general *mens rea*, it will lead to a more enforceable standard and place a higher level of responsibility on states. Even though knowledge is a lower threshold than specific or general intent, it is nevertheless a common and accepted *mens rea* requirement under criminal law. Still, the question remains, knowledge of what? As will be discussed further below, state actors have a responsibility, as sovereigns with power and control, to conduct their affairs with due regard for their international legal obligations when they have knowledge of activities within their legal or physical boundaries. Hence, it is appropriate to consider the following definition of a\"cyberspace attack\": A cyberspace attack occurs when a state knowingly uses or knowingly acquiesces to an entity under its legal control or within its territory using a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state.\nThe proposed definition of cyberspace attack essentially imposes additional responsibility under international law when a state knowingly allows a person or entity to use a cyberspace weapon against the people or property of another state. Under the unique circumstances of cyberspace, such a clear definition establishes the increased degree of responsibility necessary to promote international peace and help deter the myriad of adverse activities in cyberspace. Consider the actions of one rogue group if they were to successfully conduct a cyberspace attack against the critical infrastructure of another state. Regardless of the group's motives, whether nationalistic, ideological, or criminal, causing the death of several hundred people and millions of dollars worth of property damage is a scenario that international law must evolve to address and deter. Still, if the state is completely unaware of a rogue element's activities, then it seems appropriate not to impart responsibility and accountability under international law.\nHowever, what if the state that can legally control the rogue element knew that the element was about to or was currently engaging in a cyberspace attack against persons or property in the victim state? The responsible state could, if necessary, disrupt all communications originating from the rogue element or emanating from the state until it could locate and arrest the attackers for violating their domestic laws. The definition of a cyberspace attack, although similar to the definition of a cyberspace crime, is not intended to hold states responsible for the nefarious efforts of criminals, unless the state is aware of the criminal's efforts and knowingly acquiesces to the use of a cyberspace weapon. The objective is to develop a legal framework that inspires states to cooperate to eliminate the harmful use of cyberspace—to create deterrence.\nWithout the proposed legal framework, why should a state try to stop an impending cyberspace attack against another state? Under current state practice, if the victim state is an\"ally,\"then the responsible,\"host\"state will likely feel much more compelled to take positive steps to stop the attack. For example, if a hacker in the United Kingdom was conducting a cyberspace attack against the Hoover Dam in the United States, U.K. security and law enforcement officials would almost certainly act with all diligence to stop the attack and arrest the perpetrators, and would likely allow their extradition to the United States.[53] However, how many cyberspace events against entities in the Armed Attack in Cyberspace Some argue that international law may not be inclined to place such a clear responsibility on states for acquiescing to uses of cyberspace weapons, unless they caused effects equivalent to more traditional armed attacks.⁵⁴ However, the United Nations has issued resolutions that appear to place a higher burden on states to refrain from acquiescing to certain acts committed from their territory against other states. For example, a General Assembly Resolution in 1970, number 2625, discussed acquiescence and said that states have a duty to refrain from acquiescing or tolerating actions from within its territory that cause civil strife in the other state.⁵⁵ More recently, the United Nations of U.S. military servers in 2001 and 2002.

Res. 2625, U.N. GAOR, 25th Sess. (Oct. 24, 1970). The key excerpts from the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among states in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations are: Every State has a duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting, or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force...\nAlso, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State...\nStates have the duty to co-operate with one another, irrespective of the differences in their political, economic and social systems, in the various spheres of international relations, in order to maintain international peace and security...\nAll states enjoy sovereign equality. They have equal rights and duties...\nThe principles of the Charter which are embodied in this Declaration constitute basic principles of international law...\n\nSecurity Council issued Resolution 1373 on September 28, 2001, which reaffirmed the key principles in Resolution 2625. Resolution 1373 decided under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that all states shall take the necessary steps to prevent terrorist acts, to prevent terrorists from using their territories for terrorist purposes, and to provide early warning to other states.⁵⁶ Although not directly on point with all scenarios of cyberspace attack, some cyberspace attacks could fit within the resolutions’ already accepted prohibitions related to harboring terrorists, preventing use of territory by terrorists, and acquiescing to those who cause civil strife. The proposed definition of armed attack in cyberspace would really only increase the degree of state responsibility for non-state actors by a small amount. In light of the growing concern related to the impact of non-state actors on international peace, and considering the asymmetric and potentially dangerous attributes of cyberspace, such an increase in state responsibility is not unreasonable.\nThe strength of the proposed definition of cyberspace attack is that it would place a clear responsibility on all states. All states would know what international law requires and non-state actors would know that their actions could be considered armed attacks. Although clear and strict in comparison to the current approach, the proposed legal threshold is not improperly low. It has a reasonable *mens rea* requirement, to wit: the host state must have knowledge of the impending or ongoing use of a cyberspace weapon. Because the proposed definition requires knowing acquiescence, a state can claim the defense of impossibility. For example, the host state may have no knowledge of an ongoing cyberspace attack because the rogue element first hacked into and gained control of the entire host state’s communications infrastructure. Still, once the host state became aware of the intended location of the attack, it would then be responsible to at least communicate that information to the victim state and continue to take reasonable measures to stop or impede the attack and cooperate with the victim state.\nThe unique attributes of cyberspace, such as its speed and lack of physical borders, are key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory when they do not take reasonable measures to stop the attack and warn the victim state. One cannot overemphasize the potency of the asymmetric capabilities of cyberspace in comparison to any other war-fighting domain in the world’s history, a capability that enables almost any person to engage in actions with ⁵⁶ S.C. Res. 1373, U.N. SCOR, 4385th mtg., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1373 (Sept. 28, 2001) condemning the terrorist attacks of 9-11 and stating that “those responsible for aiding, supporting or harboring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of such acts will be held accountable.”); see also G.A. Res. 56/1, U.N. GAOR, 56th Sess., U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/1 (Sept. 12, 2001).\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 89 lethal and costly effects. Therefore, another difference between the proposed definition and current requirements under international law is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack does not include a requirement that the attack involve the armed forces of the aggressor, as the commentary to Common Article 2 requires and the U.N. definition of aggression implies. However, the U.N. definition of aggression clearly includes mercenaries and irregulars. Once more, considering the asymmetric nature of cyberspace, requiring a cyberspace attack to involve the armed forces or mercenaries of the aggressor would create a legal hole big enough for hundreds of thugs and brigands to\"attack\"the victim state. In consideration of the incredible amount of physical or information damage that non-state actors can cause in cyberspace, knowing acquiescence to such attacks is the correct standard for imposing state responsibility under international law.\nBut, is it fair to impose such strict accountability on the use of cyberspace, when some cyberspace attributes, such as ease of access and use, are similar to those of global commons? For example, some may argue that the proposed definition is contrary to Article 8 of the Hague Regulation (V).[57] Article 8 provides that “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” It is accepted that many cyberspace communications occur over “telephone cables” and similar telecommunications infrastructure. Thus, the language of Article 8 is applicable to cyberspace operations. Article 8 clearly does not place a duty on a neutral power to forbid or restrict belligerents from using their communications infrastructure. In fact, Article 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) states that any restrictive measures implemented by a neutral power must be equally applied to “both belligerents.” Article 8’s language, therefore, appears to contradict the proposed definition.\nAlternatively, one could argue that the proposed definition of cyberspace attack does not conflict with Article 8, because the proposed definition creates a transitional status for a state. Once a state becomes aware of a cyberspace attack originating from its territory and targeting another state, it is no longer a\"neutral power\"and now must act to stop the attack or become a de facto\"belligerent.\"The idea of a state transitioning between being a neutral power and a belligerent may be too tenuous for realistic application in international law. In the alternative, states could choose, when adopting the proposed definition Air Force Law Review • Volume 64 of cyberspace attack, to explicitly state that Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Regulation (V) no longer apply to cyberspace.\nGoing back to the Estonia and Georgia events, most media attributed the use of cyberspace weapons to Russian internet addresses. Despite early and widespread media attribution to Russia, the attacks continued, strongly implying that Russia was directly responsible for the attacks.⁵⁸ Apparently, Russian law enforcement and security services made no effort to stop the cyberspace attacks.⁵⁹ Russia was certainly on notice that the world community believed the cyberspace attacks were originating from within its borders. While circumstantial evidence clearly indicated that Russia knowingly acquiesced to these attacks, there was no direct evidence. Reviewing the circumstantial evidence under the proposed definition indicates that Russia violated international law and the victim states had the right of self-defense. However, relying on circumstantial evidence is not something the international community and international law are generally comfortable doing.\nThis lack of direct evidence is indicative of the attribution problem currently hindering all investigations of actions in cyberspace. Investigators of domestic cyberspace crimes meticulously use forensic tools to identify which specific internet protocol (IP) address is responsible for a cyberspace crime and then interview the suspect to determine their level of knowledge or intent. Unfortunately, overseas investigations can only be accomplished if there is cooperation between the involved states. When a foreign state does not provide equal access to forensic evidence and suspects, the attribution barrier obstructs the inquiry and protects the “attacker.” Such actions do not promote peace or resolve conflict.\nThe effects-based model would likely conclude that the Estonia and Georgia attacks were not severe enough to be considered armed attacks or even an unlawful use of force. There were no burning buildings or smashed tanks or casualties usually associated with a traditional, kinetic armed attack. The cyberspace events did not place either country’s stability in jeopardy. Reviewing the international reaction after the fact, there were no declarations by the international ⁵⁸ Arthur Bright, *Estonia accuses Russia of ‘cyberattack,’* CHRISTIAN SCI.

Charter or that they created de facto hostilities under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions. Estonia chose not to consider them armed attacks, while the Georgia situation simultaneously devolved into a kinetic conflict. What option did Estonia really have? If Estonia felt it had sufficient attribution, Estonia could have considered the acts armed attacks, creating a de facto state of hostilities and requested the assistance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under the NATO Treaty’s collective self-defense provision.⁶⁰ Estonia could have waited for NATO to risk war with Russia. Estonia could also have responded in self-defense with conventional, kinetic forces, since they did not have any “cyberspace forces.” The potential result could have been a strong conventional response from Russia, including occupation of Estonia. Again, the “bully dilemma” reared its head. This prompts the question, is it fair to rely on a 60 year-old conventional model that gives such weight to state practice when the kinetic forces and available cyberspace capabilities are so disproportionate?\nIndeed, continued reliance on such a model could lead “minor” states to develop cyberspace forces in an effort to achieve an asymmetric advantage over states with much larger kinetic capabilities, leading to a cyberspace arms race and possibly more conflicts. As the Estonia and Georgia events demonstrate, when a state knowingly chooses to not assist a victim state or hold responsible those who use cyberspace weapons against other states, international law should view that state as a transgressor.\nThat is what the proposed definition of cyberspace attack intends to do. The proposed definition will have a positive impact on international law and conflict management, because it will clearly place ⁶⁰ North Atlantic Treaty art. 5, Apr. 4, 1949, 63 Stat. 2241, 34 U.N.T.S. 243. Article 5 states: The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.\n\nresponsibility on all states to not engage in cyberspace attacks and to police and secure their cyberspace “borders.”⁶¹ Essentially, everyone will know a cyberspace attack when they see it, and everyone will know that any state that conducts or permits such an attack could suffer self-defense actions and international sanctions. The end result would hopefully be a dramatic decrease in cyberspace events of foreign origin, which would also reduce the likelihood of a cyberspace “arms race” and cause the de-escalation of low intensity conflicts in cyberspace.\n## D. Flies in the Ointment: Attribution and Espionage As referenced above, an effects-based approach magnifies the attribution problem, because it requires attribution of intentional direct participation or support by the state actor, versus knowing acquiescence. The difficulty of attribution in cyberspace prevents the evolution of realistic customary norms.⁶² No state actor can realistically consider the full spectrum of actions, because they do not know who acted against them or why. In addition, the difficulty in comprehending the full severity of the “attack,” because of the delayed effects of cyberspace weapons, compounds the difficulty in determining an appropriate response.\nUnlike the effects-based approach, the proposed definition does not require determining who controlled or supported the activity, the aggressor’s intent, or the full magnitude of the attack. Using the ⁶¹ The concept of boundaries and sovereignty in cyberspace is also a topic of discussion amongst academics and practitioners. Although there is no clear definition and enforcement of boundaries in cyberspace, all states should recognize that electronic communications of all types originate in one state and can terminate (and have effects) in another state. Therefore, a state can monitor communications occurring inside its geographic borders. For example, the NSA under the Terrorist Surveillance Program was able to monitor communications where one party was located “outside” the United States. White House Press Briefing, Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales &amp; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, Principal Deputy Dir. of Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2005/intell-051219-dni01.htm. The concept of cyberspace borders has even been expanded to include discussions of a cyberspace Monroe Doctrine with regard to cyberspace infrastructure associated to the United States. See Reviewing the Federal Cybersecurity Mission: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Homeland Sec., Sub-Comm. on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, &amp; Sci. &amp; Tech., 110th Cong. (2009) (statement of Mary Ann Davidson, Oracle Security Officer), available at http://homeland.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20090310143850-78976.pdf.\n⁶² Relying on a heuristic analysis of past actions is somewhat similar to how scientists conduct scientific experiments and then analyze the results. In order for scientific experiments and their results to be reliable, external factors must be eliminated or controlled, and all other factors must be accurately known. The lack of attribution makes it impossible to accurately complete a heuristic analysis, since three of the most important factors, identity, intent, and full severity of attack, will rarely be known without it.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 93 definitional approach, only two questions need to be resolved. First, was a cyberspace weapon used against the property or persons of a state? Second, did a foreign state knowingly allow an entity under its legal control to use the cyberspace weapon against the victim?\nEven with the proposed definitions and a two element test, one of the oldest arts, espionage, can still take advantage of the attribution difficulties in cyberspace. Espionage has long been recognized as essential to the success of states and their militaries.⁶³ While a criminal offense in virtually every nation state, espionage is not a violation of the law of war and was first recognized in the Lieber Code in 1863.⁶⁴ It was subsequently codified in the 1907 Hague Regulations and in Protocol I.⁶⁵ Acts deemed to be espionage will not trigger a state’s right to self-defense, because espionage does not violate international law. Based on the definitions from the various documents considered part of customary international law, the consistent requirement for espionage is that a member of the armed forces gathers or attempts to gather information under false pretenses or while not wearing their uniform.\nSuch a definition does not perfectly transfer over to espionage in cyberspace. Whether the person at the other computer terminal is wearing his uniform is irrelevant to attributing his identity and intent in cyberspace. Still, a cyberspace spy will intrinsically gain access to the information or data under false pretenses. The average cyberspace intruder does not disclose his identity nor does he come to the main web page and ask the webmaster for permission. Instead, he exploits vulnerabilities in software coding that allow him to gain unauthorized access, which is essentially under false pretenses as discussed in Article ⁶³ Sun Tzu stated: “So, as for enlightened lords or distinguished commanders, the reason they can overcome the adversary when action is taken and achieve unparalleled success is prescience. Prescience cannot be gained from ghost or gods.... It must be gained from what is learned by men.” SUN TZU, SUN TZU: THE NEW TRANSLATION 112 (J. H. Huang trans. 1993).\n⁶⁴ FRANCIS LIEBER, INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIELD, ART. 88 (Apr. 24, 1863), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/110?OpenDocument [hereinafter LIEBER CODE]. Article 88 defines a spy as: “a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy.”\n⁶⁵ Article 29 of Hague Regulation (IV), supra note 33, defines a spy thus: [A]cting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information, are not considered spies.\nArticle 46 of Protocol I, supra note 19, provides that a member of the armed forces shall not be considered a spy “unless he does so through an act of false pretences or deliberately in a clandestine manner.”\n\nIt is certainly possible for cyberspace spies to gain access to information and copy or degrade the data without the use of a cyberspace weapon. However, the tension between lawful espionage and armed attack in cyberspace occurs when a spy uses a cyberspace weapon to access or steal information. If a traditional spy uses a weapon, such as a pistol, the act is viewed as a criminal act, versus an armed attack. Should the same be true of a cyberspace spy who hacks into a system by using a cyberspace weapon? Applying the proposed definition of cyberspace attack, the use of a cyberspace weapon while committing espionage in or through cyberspace could be interpreted as a cyberspace attack and result in self-defense actions.\nThe only way to resolve the tension between cyberspace espionage and cyberspace attack is to determine whether the cyberspace intruder intends solely to copy and then steal the data or information. Again, this dilemma adds a layer of complexity to the attribution issue by now requiring a determination of the actor’s full intent, creating an untenable situation for the victim state. Given that actions happen so fast in cyberspace, a spy or attacker could move “in and out” before a victim state could do any more than determine the foreign internet protocol (IP) address of the intruder. A full damage assessment, identifying what happened to the victim computer system could take hours to weeks. While some cyberspace attacks may be obvious, many will not be, as the beauty of cyberspace warfare is the ability to create second and third order effects, which are difficult to identify in advance.\nThe attribution issue reaches a pinnacle of complexity when trying to resolve events between espionage and cyberspace attacks. Therefore, today, a victim state is left with three choices: (1) continue to operate in the current international system of subjective analysis and inconsistent past responses while ineffectively trying to gather very detailed attribution information; (2) develop a robust cyberspace force capable of conducting cyberspace attacks, cyberspace espionage, and able to “hack back” to develop reasonably detailed attribution information; (3) or issue an ultimatum to the international community, hoping that others will agree, which informs all other states that any activity in that state’s territory that is determined to satisfy the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack will justify self-defense actions by the victim state.\n⁶⁶ Phishing or spear phishing emails target known users on a network and always provide a false reason for the recipient to provide key information or click on a hyperlink that will then redirect the user to another web page where malicious code, read weapon, will be surreptitiously installed on the user’s computer.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 95 The difficulty with resolving the espionage issue is that under the first option a state remains vulnerable to many forms of cyberspace attack while attempting to resolve whether the event is an act of espionage or cyberspace attack and waiting for the international community to subjectively analyze the evidence. In addition, the evidence to satisfy the international community would likely include the elusive proof of actual intent to harm the victim state. Adversarial states could choose to take advantage of this slow analysis and decision loop, achieving paralysis by analysis, and methodically weaken a state with what appears to be cyberspace espionage but is in fact a number of cyberspace attacks aimed at creating third order effects. Lastly, it appears that states are not willingly sharing the details of their cyberspace activities with others, which still leaves a void of necessary information to conduct the required heuristic analysis to develop the law under the current framework.\nThe second option will help the state protect itself from adversarial activities in cyberspace and possibly lead to attributable information. In spite of this benefit, the potential of a cyberspace arms race increases. This development could lead to an increase in low scale cyberspace conflicts and ultimately result in an adversary conducting a second or third order cyberspace attack inflicting massive casualties or property damage.67 The continued development of cyberspace capabilities appears to be the current direction of the leading states, such as China, Russia, and the United States. States certainly cannot be faulted for taking such an approach, as the current international legal scheme offers them very little protection yet many opportunities to exploit the cyberspace of other states. Therefore, the race for dominance in cyberspace has begun and may soon grow out of control.\nThe second option also has some parallels to the approach that states took when nuclear tensions were high during the Cold War. The superpowers recognized that conventional methodologies could not be applied to the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). States recognized that Article 51’s right of self-defense limited them to proportional actions. However, due to the overwhelming effect and fairly rapid speed of any nuclear attack, states were doctrinally prepared to respond in full at the first indication of even a limited attack, since they recognized that they could not afford to wait and see how many warheads or which locations the adversary’s warheads hit and how much damage they caused. Superpowers projected that they were capable, prepared, and willing to respond to even a limited, targeted nuclear first-strike with a full-scale response.\n\nHistorically, one can see how nation states adopted their practice in light of the dramatic increase in speed and lethality of nuclear attacks using ICBM’s compared to the previous conventional method of warfare, circa World War II. While many decried the age of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and called it “mad,” one cannot dispute that during that time period, even though there was a nuclear arms race, no nuclear weapons were used. Mad or not, MAD was an effective method of deterrence. There are a number of parallels between the use of ICBMs and cyberspace operations: cyberspace attacks have the potential for incredible lethality; much greater speed than previous weapons; and the actual severity of the threat, the intent, and the identity of the actor are usually too difficult to determine in sufficient time to respond appropriately before the damage is done.\nHowever, there is one crucial difference between today’s option two situation (developing a robust cyberspace force and “hacking back”) and the deterrence model of MAD during the Cold War. Currently, it does not appear that a substantial number of states are willing to make a declaration of mutually assured destruction through cyberspace and simultaneously abstain from conducting cyberspace operations. Without such declarations and cessation of the use of cyberspace weapons, the parallels with the Cold War nuclear deterrence model end. Pragmatically, states do not feel the impetus to consider such an approach. There has been no mass disaster or 9-11 type “wake-up call” in cyberspace, and, as noted above, a number of states likely believe they can “win” in cyberspace. Therefore, applying the nuclear deterrence model to cyberspace operations is not practical. Unfortunately, history has shown that society rarely chooses to collectively legislate against harm until after it suffers the consequences.\nStill, there is one historical example where society chose to proactively legislate and limit the weaponization of a domain, much like option three. The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space.⁶⁸ The third option can perhaps draw strength from the efforts to limit the militarization of space, recognizing cyberspace as a sort of international commons similar to outer space. Each state, relying on the proposed definitions, would still retain its sovereignty and control of cyberspace infrastructure located within its borders. The implementation of the proposed definitions would recognize that the use of cyberspace is intended for peace-promoting purposes and the use of weapons in cyberspace, even for espionage purposes, will not be accepted. Providing states the right of self-defense using the lower, clear threshold of the proposed ⁶⁸ Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Jan. 27, 1967, 6 I.L.M. 386, available at http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 97 definitions will hopefully inspire states to abstain from cyberspace espionage and attacks and cooperate to protect the peaceful use of cyberspace.\n## IV. APPLYING THE DEFINITIONS AND EXERCISING SELF-DEFENSE IN CYBERSPACE In order to further understand how option three’s (issuing an ultimatum that the state could respond in self-defense to cyberspace attacks) use of the proposed definitions will promote peace and reduce the improper use of cyberspace, it is helpful to explore how states could act in response to a cyberspace attack. The doctrine of self-defense relies on two principles: necessity and proportionality. Necessity involves whether effective peaceful means of resolution exist; the nature of the aggression, each party’s objectives, and the likelihood of effective intervention by the international community.⁶⁹ Proportionality requires limiting the magnitude, scope, and duration of the force used in response to that which is reasonably necessary to counter the threat or attack.⁷⁰ The timing of a self-defense action is closely related to the factor of necessity and is a debated issue. A delayed response weakens a state’s claim of necessity to defend itself. While an early response in anticipation of attack also draws questions as to the certainty of need for the self-defense action.\nLooking at necessity and the timing of self-defense actions in cyberspace, the unique qualities of cyberspace again highlight the importance of moving toward a deterrence model. Once a state suffers what it believes to be an armed attack in or through cyberspace, it can arguably satisfy the above requirements of necessity to defend itself. Unfortunately, in cyberspace, there will likely not be sufficient time to consider peaceful resolution of the matter, fully understand the nature of the attack or the intended results, or to mobilize international peacekeeping forces. Thus, the more difficult question related to necessity is how appropriate is anticipatory self-defense in cyberspace?\nAnticipatory self-defense “justifies use of force in anticipation of an ‘imminent’ armed attack.”⁷¹ Basically, a state need not wait to receive the aggressor’s attack and can instead act in self-defense to “repel” the attack.⁷² The doctrine “finds it roots in the 1837 Caroline case and subsequent correspondence between then-U.S. Secretary of ⁶⁹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK 4 (2007) [hereinafter U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK]; see also YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION AND SELF-DEFENCE (4th ed. 2005).\n⁷⁰ U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 69.\n⁷¹ Id. at 6.\n⁷² Id.\n\nState Daniel Webster and his British Foreign Office counterpart Lord Ashburton.\"73 Secretary Webster informed Lord Ashburton that a state can act in self-defense when the circumstances are\"instantaneous, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation.\"74 The attributes of cyberspace, especially speed and lethality, seem quite similar to Secretary Webster's factors. Essentially, if a state is fortunate enough to develop information about a developing or planned cyberspace attack against it, the attributes of cyberspace may compel a state to act in its best interest and exercise anticipatory self-defense.\nThe follow-on question involves what a state can do in self-defense, i.e. how is the principle of proportional response applied in and through cyberspace? In cyberspace, there may be a number of ways to technically counter an attack. A state could disconnect itself from cyberspace. However, such a response seems disproportionately burdensome on the victim state and could cause other forms of harm internally. The victim state could quickly counter with anti-virus measures, although such efforts are always a game of\"catch-up.\"The victim state could respond by disconnecting all cyberspace connections with the aggressor state. However, this will only work as long as the aggressor state chooses not to attack through another state. Moreover, such actions require attribution.\nBecause a state needs to know against which state to exercise self-defense, developing reliable attribution represents another difficulty with applying age-old laws and methods to cyberspace. Given that a cyberspace attack comes from another country and could involve communications\"hopping\"through several other countries, it is nearly impossible for a state to develop attribution without first violating the cyberspace infrastructure and jurisdiction of other states. Currently, to avoid violating another state's cyberspace, states send requests for assistance to cooperating states. The victim state requests help in developing information about the IP address in question and also requests monitoring of that IP address, allowing the state to\"hop back\"to the next IP address, and then request more help. This\"hopping back\"process can be painful and long, leaving the victim state vulnerable. However, the traditional police doctrine of hot pursuit is expanding in international law. Under customary international law, ships and planes can follow offending vessels in hot pursuit up to another state's territorial sea or airspace.75 However, the European Union has adopted the Schengen Agreement that permits law enforcement officials to cross state borders when pursuing a criminal suspected of certain serious Armed Attack in Cyberspace 99 offenses⁷⁶ The agreement provides that the pursuing officers will cease their pursuit upon request of the other state, however, the pursuing officers can request that the other state arrest the suspect.⁷⁷ Extending the principles of the Schengen Agreement to the domain of cyberspace seems logical, because attacks in cyberspace are analogous to serious criminal offenses. Permitting hot pursuit is consistent with the proposed definition’s efforts to deter states from knowingly acquiescing to cyberspace attacks. Witting host states will find it much harder to hide in the shadow of attribution. Providing victim states with a legal “hot pursuit” capability, including proper coordination mechanisms, will be invaluable to promoting cooperation, reducing crime, and deterring attacks in and through cyberspace.\nWith the ability to more quickly attribute attacks, a state would then have other options to consider under the principle of proportionate response. The victim state could consider firing back in self-defense with a cyberspace weapon at the actual computer(s) used to attack it. This can be reasonably effective if a limited number of computers are involved.⁷⁸ However, a victim state will likely remain concerned, due to its limited ability to determine whether more attacks or attacks of increasing severity will follow the initial round of attacks. This challenge may lead a state to consider more serious measures, such as responding with a self-defense attack that involves disrupting a substantial portion of the witting host state’s cyberspace. However, the collateral damage from such a self-defense action could be substantial. The questions of necessity and anticipatory self-defense also affect the proportionality decision. Moreover, nothing prohibits states from defending against a cyberspace attack by using kinetic weapons, such as striking a key communication node with a cruise missile or damaging a state’s communication satellite(s). The hypotheticals and the potential for conflict abound. Thus, the unique nature of cyberspace and the inability to clearly apply current international laws, norms, and practices make resolution of conflict extremely difficult, and should inspire states to seek a framework of cooperation and deterrence, such as the one I advocate in this article.\n\n# V. LOOKING FORWARD AND CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\nThe definitions proposed in this article provide a framework for consistency and an opportunity to level the playing field of international law. Today, states can either choose to continue with the status quo, or, recognizing the benefits of the peaceful use of cyberspace, embrace the need for clear definitions of cyberspace weapon and cyberspace attack. Embracing the definitions I propose would, at most, have a moderate impact on how international affairs are conducted today. The Schengen Agreement and the E.U. Convention on Cybercrime serve as models to build a framework of cooperation to promote peace and reduce crime. States would need to establish cyberspace communications centers, whereby each state would agree to pass information to another state as soon as it became aware of a cyberspace attack against a victim state, but is currently unable to halt the attack from affecting the victim state.⁷⁹ The centers would also coordinate the hot pursuit issues related to developing attribution.\nThose states that choose not to adopt the proposed legal definitions and methods of cooperation would do so knowing that their actions or inaction could be viewed as a cyberspace attack. Each state would still continue to exercise its right of self-defense. Meanwhile, the international community could apply the new legal standard when considering whether to apply sanctions. The end result is that the proposed definition of a cyberspace attack with cooperative application under international law could make a powerful form of asymmetric warfare untenable before it develops into an arms race that leads to increased conflicts and harms people and property.\nWhen our predecessors developed the law of conflict management it is doubtful anyone could foresee the day when a state could attack another state simply by manipulating electronic data. Even the futuristic Buck Rogers and lasers still had visible, kinetic-like effects. Today, one must recognize that the lack of specific definitions for “weapon” and “armed attack” create an untenable vacuum in the evolving domain of cyberspace. So far, only the criminal law has provided thorough definitions in an attempt to keep pace with the development of nefarious tools in cyberspace. The criminal law methodology provides a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt such definitions to the various uses of prohibited cyberspace tools. The field of international law requires similar flexibility. This article attempted to craft a definition of a cyberspace weapon from the criminal law’s efforts to specifically define the acts caused by cyberspace criminals. The\n⁷⁹ A state could of course provide the information to the potential victim state, even if they were able to halt the attack before it caused harm. This extra level of cooperation would assist all states in developing their capabilities to detect potential cyberspace attacks.\nArmed Attack in Cyberspace 101\ncriminal law methodology facilitated the development of a definition of a cyberspace attack. By applying the current international law framework to the proposed definition of an armed attack in cyberspace, this article highlighted how such a definition could lead to parity in cyberspace and thereby promote peace through deterrence."
