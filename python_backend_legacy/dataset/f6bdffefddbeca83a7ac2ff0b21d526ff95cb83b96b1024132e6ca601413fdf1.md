Footnote 7\nWhile the language employed has been defensive in tone, it often entails offensive action. For instance, US Cyber Command characterises ‘defend forward’ as follows: ‘if a device, a network, an organization, or adversary nation is identified as a threat to US networks and institutions, or is actively attacking them in or through cyberspace – it can expect the United States to impose costs in response.’ Stating that costs will be imposed not only on those actively attacking ‘US networks and institutions’ but also those considered ‘a threat to US networks and institutions’ implies that defend forward is not passive, but has offensive elements. The same goes for ‘persistent engagement’, which Cyber Command argues shifts its ‘posture in cyberspace from reactive to proactive’ and includes efforts to ‘degrade the capabilities and networks of adversaries’. Footnote 8\nWe define an action in cyberspace as offensive if it involves gaining unauthorised access to a computer network and then using that access to extract information, cause destruction or plant malicious code. This includes cyber espionage and intelligence operations. Under this definition, ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’ are offensive. These actions may have defensive purposes, such as uncovering the offensive capabilities of an adversary to protect one’s own networks. But they are not defensive in the sense of merely seeking to strengthen a network against intrusions and responding to intrusions only when they occur.\nBefore shifting resources into offensive cyber operations, it would be prudent to consider, and to the extent possible harness, the advantages of being on the defensive. Defensive modes of warfare tend to attract less scholarly interest than their offensive counterparts. Footnote 9 Our aim is to provide a more balanced assessment of the power of defensive measures, which can help moderate calls for a highly aggressive approach to cyber security. We argue that, properly assessed, cyber defence is strong and getting stronger. We tilt towards scholars such as Thomas Rid and Erik Gartzke, who have sought to reduce alarmism about cyber capabilities among policymakers and the public. Footnote 10\n## The growing power of the defence\nThe offence-defence literature assesses whether it is easier to attack or to defend in war, how technology and geography alter the balance between the offence and the defence, and the effects\nof this balance on international relations, especially as a cause of war. An offence-dominant world is more war-prone because even non-aggressive actors are tempted to strike first. Footnote 11 A number of scholars have tried to assess the strengths, weaknesses and implications of the balance between offence and defence in cyberspace. Footnote 12 Ben Buchanan argues that the nature of cyber capabilities produces a cybersecurity dilemma that explains the calls to unleash the cyber offence to secure the state. He notes that even states without hostile intentions must engage in offensive network penetrations to ready their cyber defences against an adversary's hidden offensive capabilities. Footnote 13 Others have argued that the relative weakness and impermanence of cyber attacks mean that offensive actions in cyber can actually ease security dilemmas. For example, resorting only to cyber attacks in response to a crisis could forestall crisis escalation and produce reassurance by signalling a country's intention not to extend warfare beyond cyberspace. Footnote 14\nOf course, the offence-defence balance can be misperceived, with disastrous consequences. Just prior to the First World War, the great powers had considerable faith in the superiority of the offence, which helped precipitate war. Footnote 15 Policymakers are now underrating the advantages of the defence, this time in cyber. According to Richard Clarke and Robert Knake, in the early days of the internet, the attacker had a distinct advantage because the internet's defences were so porous. Footnote 16 As recently as a decade ago, according to a former US National Security Agency (NSA) cryptanalyst, cyber attackers could infiltrate industrial-control systems relatively easily. Footnote 17 Today, however, the balance has begun to shift towards the defender. Footnote 18 Dave Aitel, a veteran hacker who worked for the NSA and then private cybersecurity firms, told Clarke and Knake that intrusion-detection capabilities 'actually work', which is 'a huge change'. This makes the job of the attacker much more difficult. 'For the nation-state offense', Aitel said, 'you put such a premium on not getting caught that you really don't have a huge advantage'. Footnote 19 In some ways this is unsurprising. Cyber security is one of the top ten fastest-growing fields, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with a projected growth rate of 35% over the next ten years, much higher than the projected growth rate of jobs in other fields. Footnote 20 The more resources that the government and private sector invest in cyber security, the more difficult it becomes for attackers to find soft targets. Footnote 21 The advantages of cyber defence over offence were among the findings of the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission in 2020. Footnote 22\nWhile technological shifts affect the balance between attack and defence in conventional warfare, the built-in advantages of the defence eventually tend to reassert themselves. New technologies can initially favour the attacker, but when these technologies diffuse to the defender, and the defender combines them with its inherent advantages, the attacker's initial edge often slips away. In 1940, when the German army crushed France's in six weeks, it appeared that German panzers, which seemed unstoppable, had decisively shifted the balance to the attacker's advantage.\nHowever, when the defender armed itself with the same weapons and adjusted its tactics, the balance shifted back to the defence. Later in the war, the Germans themselves demonstrated how technology had empowered the defence. In resisting the Allied advance after D-Day, the Germans used their panzers to strengthen defence-in-depth and inflicted major losses on the Allied attackers. In July 1944, for instance, during Operation Goodwood, the Germans destroyed more than a third of the British tanks brought onto the continent after the Normandy landings. Footnote 23 The difficulties Ukraine encountered in its recent counter-offensive reflected the effectiveness of Russia's prepared defence. Footnote 24 A similar arc is playing out in cyberspace.\nDespite the general recognition that defence is the stronger form of cyber warfare, investment in defensive capabilities and techniques has lagged because of the costs of implementation. That too is now changing. Defence is getting cheaper and stronger, driving up the costs of engaging in offence and strengthening deterrence. Not only are advances in network technology and security making cyber defence even stronger, but these innovations are also reducing the cost of deploying resilient cyber defence-in-depth, which some network defenders are already deploying. Some have argued that, given unlimited time and resources, the cyber attacker will always get through, affording the offence a long-term advantage. Footnote 25 But the mere fact that an attacker can gain access to a defender's computer network does not mean it will defeat the defender. The fight does not stop at the network's border. Indeed, given the speed and frequency of cyber attacks, preventing every network penetration and exploitation is impossible, and resilience is key to functionality. But many of the advantages enjoyed by the defender do not arise until after the attacker has actually gained unauthorised access to the network. With a properly organised cyber defence, networks can become more resilient, continuing to function despite penetration, while frustrating attackers' attempts to exploit their intrusion.\n## Conventional war vs cyber war\nSome tactical advantages of the defence in conventional ground warfare are straightforward. The defender usually fires at the oncoming attacker from behind cover. The attacker must break cover and move towards the defender to dislodge it. Consequently, the attackers must expose themselves to deadly fire to engage the defenders, who will inflict more casualties on exposed attackers than they themselves suffer. Footnote 26 These defensive advantages yield the rule of thumb that three attackers are required to subdue one defender, a ratio some have increased to six-to-one owing to the greater lethality and accuracy of new weapons. Footnote 27\nIn conventional warfare, the defender is also typically more familiar with the terrain that the attacker must traverse and has often prepared it for defence. Footnote 28 The defender will employ natural and built obstacles to channel the attacker into areas of the battlefield where it is most vulnerable to the defender's fires. Through such preparations, the defender can seize the\ninitiative. When an attacker penetrates a well-prepared defence-in-depth, it is often following to the defender's script. In that case, the defender, not the attacker, can dictate the terms of engagement. Moreover, a stalwart defence-in-depth can produce victory by so frustrating an attacker that it breaks off the attack. During the Cold War, the US Army – a force steeped in the virtues of the offence but then insuperably outnumbered by Soviet conventional forces in Europe – rediscovered the virtues of the defensive, crystallising them in its doctrines of Active Defense and AirLand Battle. Footnote 29\nIn the cyber realm too, defenders typically have better knowledge of the terrain – the network they are defending – than attackers. Today, this awareness is increased through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to map the network's terrain and detect anomalous behaviour. Footnote 30 Employing AI in cyber defence is essential because the sheer volume and speed of attacks mean that individual cyber defenders cannot possibly detect and address each one. Footnote 31 The terrain of cyberspace, however, is different from the natural battlespace that is shaped by the defender in ground combat. Cyberspace has far greater plasticity than physical space, offering the defender more options in preparing the battlespace. Footnote 32\nGaining unauthorised access to a network is only the first step for the attacker. It must still find what it is looking for, which calls for mapping the network. This is why hackers often spend so much time inside a network before moving to exploitation. Russian hackers were inside the network of the DNC for months before they exfiltrated the batch of internal email communications that caused such a stir. Footnote 33 Once in the network, of course, the attacker is on the defender's terrain. However, a computer network is not like a terrain feature on a battlefield. It would be impossible for a conventional defender to make forests spring up where once there were plains or to render valleys smooth and bring mountains low. The defender in cyberspace, however, can do something comparable, altering the digital ground under the attacker's feet by changing the configuration of its network, thus preserving its superior situational awareness. Footnote 34 Such techniques can frustrate the attacker into breaking off its attack. Even if they don't, when the defender of a network periodically alters the configuration of the network, attackers that have managed to avoid detection and are assiduously mapping the network for exploitation will find that their data has become outdated. The harder it is to map a network, the longer the attacker must stay in the system, increasing the likelihood that it will be discovered. Furthermore, if the attacker has manipulated part of the network to hide its presence, reconfiguring the network can expose its hideout when it fails to change with the rest of the network.\nCyber defenders are already using some of these defensive tactics. For instance, the health-insurance company Aetna's cyber defenders routinely change aspects of its network so that attackers are never certain about their position within it, retaining their home-court advantage. Footnote 35 Intentional network manipulation is also getting easier by virtue of cloud-\ninfrastructure virtualisation. Devices are virtualised and typically provided as services, which means that there is nothing physical to purchase, house, wire, power or cool. A cloud provider such as Amazon maintains the virtual device, and users simply configure it to their specifications. The elements physically exposed to the internet are owned, operated and defended by the cloud provider. The flexibility this affords to shape the terrain is immense. In fact, virtualisation allows the cyber defender to change the shape of the terrain during an attack to frustrate the attacker. Footnote 36 The network that can change its configuration is a more resilient network, which is especially important for military forces that need to fend off virtual attackers while simultaneously fighting physical adversaries.\nFew companies have a cyber-defence budget the size of Aetna's, and in the past few could mount an elaborate defence. But now that the components of a network are owned, operated and defended by the likes of Amazon, economies of scale make the resources and expertise necessary to mount a formidable cyber defence-in-depth within reach of an expanding range of national governments, local governments and private companies.\nFinally, even if a cyber attack is successful, virtualisation facilitates quick recovery. It is much easier to load a pre-attack version of a virtual machine, patch its vulnerabilities and return it to service than it is to restore a physical computer to an earlier state. Virtualisation may also mean that defenders have access to a wider array of online resources to deal with distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nCyber attackers, of course, can also manipulate the virtual terrain of the network they have infiltrated. But defenders are still countering from their own territory, and their superior control and knowledge of the network means that they know the inventory and can detect changes through relatively simple means, such as white lists. Defenders can also embed responses triggered when behaviour outside of the network's established norms occurs that morphs the network and isolates the attacker. The defender still enjoys significant home-field advantages.\n# Observing the attacker\nIn ground combat, the defender can observe the approach of an attacker while remaining concealed, gathering information on capabilities and intentions. Footnote 37 The defender of a computer network can do the same. The informational advantages increase when the network defender also reconfigures the network. In facilitating the defender's search for technical signatures, these defensive advantages can also help it overcome one of the thorniest problems in cyberspace: the attacker's anonymity. With these advantages in mind, the cyber-security firm MITRE has decided that it would not make its primary objective to eject attackers from the network. Instead, it isolates and observes attackers in its system to learn about the tools they are\nusing and to waste the time of the attacker, which often has no idea that it is under observation or that it has lost the initiative.\nThe intelligence-gathering capacity of the defender increases dramatically when it exploits the malleability of the virtual landscape by establishing fake machines, known as 'honey pots', or entire fictitious networks, called 'honey nets', on its network. To draw another conventional-warfare analogy, in the Second World War, the Germans would leave the first few defensive positions that they constructed empty. Unaware of this, the attacker would deploy to breach these phantom positions. Concealed German scouts would observe this action and communicate tactical intelligence about artillery, air support and other factors to the defenders in the inhabited positions. Likewise, the cyber defender can build fake computers and networks populated with fake data to fool the attacker, and even malicious code to infect it. Footnote  $^{38}$  Moreover, because honey nets are quiet networks with very little traffic, the defender can identify any intrusion as the work of a malicious actor. At no time would the actual home network be in danger. The intruder, for its part, would remain ignorant of the fact that the stalwart defence it is confronting is not there to protect the defender's actual network. Perhaps the most important resources that the attacker wastes in breaching a honey net are exploitation tools. Once it uses one, the defender can patch against that tool in its home network, inoculating it against that exploit. In addition, honey nets can potentially contribute to cyber resilience. If the attacker diverts resources to a honey net, it is not in the real network disrupting its normal operations, reducing the degradation of the network and allowing normal operations to continue despite the presence of an intruder.\nThe extensive information obtained in defending a false network can also empower AI tools being used in a detection and defence role in the defender's real network. In order for AI to learn what to defend against, it needs data on previous attacks, and it is vital that this data be constantly updated. AI can work from the data generated from the defence of the honey net to defend the real network, detect intrusion attempts against it, and identify the intruder based on the kinds of exploitation tools it uses and other signatures. AI might even be able to predict the next move of the attacker. Footnote 39\nFinally, many, perhaps most, decisions about cyber security in both the private and public sectors are financial. If the projected losses from intrusions are lower than the cost of providing security, then governments and countries will forgo the security upgrade. For instance, prior to the 2016 election, a cyber-security consultant told the DNC that its computer network was vulnerable. Rather than spend resources on a cyber-security upgrade, the DNC decided to allocate the resources that would have required to increasing voter turnout – a decision they would come to regret. Footnote  $^{40}$  The virtualisation of computer networks has reduced the cost of building honey nets, and this service is now provided by several cyber-security firms. Footnote  $^{41}$\n# The offence–defence balance and the cyber-security dilemma\nSometimes the only way to stop a persistent attacker is to counter-attack and disrupt its ability to keep attacking. Offensive as well as defensive cyber capabilities will unavoidably be part of any major conflict. But it's important to remember that defence is not entirely inactive. As Carl von Clausewitz noted almost 200 years ago, ‘the defensive form of war is not a simple shield, but a shield made up of well-directed blows’. Footnote 42 The information that the cyber defender gathers about the attacker’s techniques and modes of operation can inform a more effective counter-attack. Such cyber counter-attacks, called response actions, are part of US doctrine for defensive cyber operations. The relevant doctrinal publication defines them as ‘external to the defended network or portion of cyberspace without the permission of the owner of the affected system … normally in foreign cyberspace’. Some response actions may involve the ‘physical damage or destruction of enemy systems’. Footnote 43 Through the use of honey pots and honey nets, for instance, the defender might introduce disguised malicious code, which the attacker unwittingly extracts and incorporates into its own network. Response actions aim to ‘kill the archer’ instead of just ‘catching arrows’. Footnote 44 They are central to the more offensive aspects of ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’.\nThe use and scale of response actions depends upon the context of the attack, and the degree of actual and potential damage inflicted. The most important consideration, however, is ‘the degree of certainty in attribution of the threat’. Footnote 45 Cyber attackers make Herculean efforts to hide their identity to reduce the likelihood of retaliation. Footnote 46 To avoid escalation and diplomatic discord, it is crucial that the counter-attacker determine that its target is the actual attacker. Here the advantages of cyber defence for counter-attack come into focus. A capable cyber defender gathers extensive information on the attacker, including its methods and intentions, which, with human and other technical intelligence, can be used to arrive at the attacker’s identity. The longer the cyber defender observes the attacker, the better the overall intelligence package. In cyberspace, the best offence may emerge from a stalwart defence.\nAI and quantum computing are sometimes seen as shifting the balance in cyber warfare decisively to the offence. This seems far from certain. AI is likely be as effective on defence as it is on offence. AI is being used, for example, to develop intrusion-detection systems that ‘outperform other techniques because of their flexibility, adaptability, rapid calculations, and quick learning’. Footnote 47 While quantum computing will make it harder for defenders to encrypt their networks, cyber-security experts have begun designing essentially quantum-proof encryption. Footnote 48\nBen Buchanan argues that there is a security dilemma in the cyber domain that will drive states to engage in offensive cyber operations. The logic is that states must offensively penetrate their\npotential adversaries' networks to discover what offensive capabilities they possess; they, in turn, could interpret these intrusions as precursors to an attack or the attack itself, eliciting a cyber counter-attack and potentially triggering an escalatory spiral. Footnote  $^{49}$  Yet full consideration of the advantages of the cyber defence can dampen this logic. One key reason nation-states might engage in offensive cyber intrusions is that they think that their identity will remain hidden. But a defender who mobilises the advantages of cyber defence can use the information it gains to identify the potential attacker. Beyond that, the defender can use the information about the attacker's capabilities to launch a precisely targeted counter-attack. This capability constitutes a substantial deterrent.\nAgain, offensive capabilities are a necessary part of cyber national security, and penetrating networks will prove essential in any conflict spanning multiple domains. But defenders do not always need to attack opposing networks to develop and hone their offensive cyber capabilities. This can be done through red-teaming, which has become a common practice in network defence in cyberspace. Companies like MITRE and FireEye develop offensive cyber tools to stress-test the networks of their customers. Structurally, as cyber defence becomes stronger, offensive intrusions will require more and more resources, decreasing their efficiency over time. Money and time – the latter being a resource we can never recover – will be better spent on cyber defence. Without doubt, incentives will remain to engage in intrusions, albeit in the name of defence, but undertaking them will become increasingly risky and inefficient, and the incentives for doing so correspondingly diminished. Accordingly, the intensity of the cybersecurity dilemma is likely to decrease.\n\\*\nWe have painted a rather optimistic picture of the future of cyber defence, and we acknowledge that it is hardly guaranteed. As in conventional war, the offence-defence balance is not static. For now, however, advances in cyber-security technology have made it easier to harness the advantages of cyber defence. The balance has shifted towards the defender and is likely to shift still further in its favour. Policymakers therefore should not assume that offensive cyber operations are the most effective tools for assurance and de-escalation. Footnote  $^{50}$  A key objective of a strategy is to convince adversaries that their own strategies cannot succeed. Footnote  $^{51}$  Advertising and mobilising the advantages of the cyber defence could affect their perceptions, helping to convince them that the offensive game is not worth the candle.\nFurthermore, as Clausewitz argued, there are advantages to being on the defensive at the strategic as well as the tactical level. It is plausible that the tactical advantages of cyber defence could be scaled up to protect a strategic network of networks. There has been much hand-wringing about the havoc that minor-power adversaries such as Iran and North Korea could wreak in cyberspace. But minor-power US allies can also punch above their weight in cyberspace, and they have a vested interest in securing it. Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine have intriguingly proposed a\nvirtual alliance among technologically advanced democracies. Footnote 52 Properly organised and coordinated, they could collectively employ the tactical advantages of cyber defence to establish a formidable network of networks, prioritising defensive measures, sharing information gathered on attackers and strengthening cyber security across the board. This would be a powerful means of consolidating the defenders' advantages and deterring those who would seek to achieve cyber security through cyber attack.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Peter Wostenberg, a PhD candidate in Baylor University's Department of Political Science, for his assistance with research and revisions.",

Through such preparations, the defender can seize the\ninitiative. When an attacker penetrates a well-prepared defence-in-depth, it is often following to the defender's script. In that case, the defender, not the attacker, can dictate the terms of engagement. Moreover, a stalwart defence-in-depth can produce victory by so frustrating an attacker that it breaks off the attack. During the Cold War, the US Army – a force steeped in the virtues of the offence but then insuperably outnumbered by Soviet conventional forces in Europe – rediscovered the virtues of the defensive, crystallising them in its doctrines of Active Defense and AirLand Battle. Footnote 29\nIn the cyber realm too, defenders typically have better knowledge of the terrain – the network they are defending – than attackers. Today, this awareness is increased through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to map the network's terrain and detect anomalous behaviour. Footnote 30 Employing AI in cyber defence is essential because the sheer volume and speed of attacks mean that individual cyber defenders cannot possibly detect and address each one. Footnote 31 The terrain of cyberspace, however, is different from the natural battlespace that is shaped by the defender in ground combat. Cyberspace has far greater plasticity than physical space, offering the defender more options in preparing the battlespace. Footnote 32\nGaining unauthorised access to a network is only the first step for the attacker. It must still find what it is looking for, which calls for mapping the network. This is why hackers often spend so much time inside a network before moving to exploitation. Russian hackers were inside the network of the DNC for months before they exfiltrated the batch of internal email communications that caused such a stir. Footnote 33 Once in the network, of course, the attacker is on the defender's terrain. However, a computer network is not like a terrain feature on a battlefield. It would be impossible for a conventional defender to make forests spring up where once there were plains or to render valleys smooth and bring mountains low. The defender in cyberspace, however, can do something comparable, altering the digital ground under the attacker's feet by changing the configuration of its network, thus preserving its superior situational awareness. Footnote 34 Such techniques can frustrate the attacker into breaking off its attack. Even if they don't, when the defender of a network periodically alters the configuration of the network, attackers that have managed to avoid detection and are assiduously mapping the network for exploitation will find that their data has become outdated. The harder it is to map a network, the longer the attacker must stay in the system, increasing the likelihood that it will be discovered. Furthermore, if the attacker has manipulated part of the network to hide its presence, reconfiguring the network can expose its hideout when it fails to change with the rest of the network.\nCyber defenders are already using some of these defensive tactics. For instance, the health-insurance company Aetna's cyber defenders routinely change aspects of its network so that attackers are never certain about their position within it, retaining their home-court advantage. Footnote 35 Intentional network manipulation is also getting easier by virtue of cloud-\ninfrastructure virtualisation. Devices are virtualised and typically provided as services, which means that there is nothing physical to purchase, house, wire, power or cool. A cloud provider such as Amazon maintains the virtual device, and users simply configure it to their specifications. The elements physically exposed to the internet are owned, operated and defended by the cloud provider. The flexibility this affords to shape the terrain is immense. In fact, virtualisation allows the cyber defender to change the shape of the terrain during an attack to frustrate the attacker. Footnote 36 The network that can change its configuration is a more resilient network, which is especially important for military forces that need to fend off virtual attackers while simultaneously fighting physical adversaries.\nFew companies have a cyber-defence budget the size of Aetna's, and in the past few could mount an elaborate defence. But now that the components of a network are owned, operated and defended by the likes of Amazon, economies of scale make the resources and expertise necessary to mount a formidable cyber defence-in-depth within reach of an expanding range of national governments, local governments and private companies.\nFinally, even if a cyber attack is successful, virtualisation facilitates quick recovery. It is much easier to load a pre-attack version of a virtual machine, patch its vulnerabilities and return it to service than it is to restore a physical computer to an earlier state. Virtualisation may also mean that defenders have access to a wider array of online resources to deal with distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nCyber attackers, of course, can also manipulate the virtual terrain of the network they have infiltrated. But defenders are still countering from their own territory, and their superior control and knowledge of the network means that they know the inventory and can detect changes through relatively simple means, such as white lists. Defenders can also embed responses triggered when behaviour outside of the network's established norms occurs that morphs the network and isolates the attacker. The defender still enjoys significant home-field advantages.\n# Observing the attacker\nIn ground combat, the defender can observe the approach of an attacker while remaining concealed, gathering information on capabilities and intentions. Footnote 37 The defender of a computer network can do the same. The informational advantages increase when the network defender also reconfigures the network. In facilitating the defender's search for technical signatures, these defensive advantages can also help it overcome one of the thorniest problems in cyberspace: the attacker's anonymity. With these advantages in mind, the cyber-security firm MITRE has decided that it would not make its primary objective to eject attackers from the network. Instead, it isolates and observes attackers in its system to learn about the tools they are\nusing and to waste the time of the attacker, which often has no idea that it is under observation or that it has lost the initiative.\nThe intelligence-gathering capacity of the defender increases dramatically when it exploits the malleability of the virtual landscape by establishing fake machines, known as 'honey pots', or entire fictitious networks, called 'honey nets', on its network. To draw another conventional-warfare analogy, in the Second World War, the Germans would leave the first few defensive positions that they constructed empty. Unaware of this, the attacker would deploy to breach these phantom positions. Concealed German scouts would observe this action and communicate tactical intelligence about artillery, air support and other factors to the defenders in the inhabited positions. Likewise, the cyber defender can build fake computers and networks populated with fake data to fool the attacker, and even malicious code to infect it. Footnote  $^{38}$  Moreover, because honey nets are quiet networks with very little traffic, the defender can identify any intrusion as the work of a malicious actor. At no time would the actual home network be in danger. The intruder, for its part, would remain ignorant of the fact that the stalwart defence it is confronting is not there to protect the defender's actual network. Perhaps the most important resources that the attacker wastes in breaching a honey net are exploitation tools. Once it uses one, the defender can patch against that tool in its home network, inoculating it against that exploit. In addition, honey nets can potentially contribute to cyber resilience. If the attacker diverts resources to a honey net, it is not in the real network disrupting its normal operations, reducing the degradation of the network and allowing normal operations to continue despite the presence of an intruder.\nThe extensive information obtained in defending a false network can also empower AI tools being used in a detection and defence role in the defender's real network. In order for AI to learn what to defend against, it needs data on previous attacks, and it is vital that this data be constantly updated. AI can work from the data generated from the defence of the honey net to defend the real network, detect intrusion attempts against it, and identify the intruder based on the kinds of exploitation tools it uses and other signatures. AI might even be able to predict the next move of the attacker. Footnote 39\nFinally, many, perhaps most, decisions about cyber security in both the private and public sectors are financial. If the projected losses from intrusions are lower than the cost of providing security, then governments and countries will forgo the security upgrade. For instance, prior to the 2016 election, a cyber-security consultant told the DNC that its computer network was vulnerable. Rather than spend resources on a cyber-security upgrade, the DNC decided to allocate the resources that would have required to increasing voter turnout – a decision they would come to regret. Footnote  $^{40}$  The virtualisation of computer networks has reduced the cost of building honey nets, and this service is now provided by several cyber-security firms. Footnote  $^{41}$\n# The offence–defence balance and the cyber-security dilemma\nSometimes the only way to stop a persistent attacker is to counter-attack and disrupt its ability to keep attacking. Offensive as well as defensive cyber capabilities will unavoidably be part of any major conflict. But it's important to remember that defence is not entirely inactive. As Carl von Clausewitz noted almost 200 years ago, ‘the defensive form of war is not a simple shield, but a shield made up of well-directed blows’. Footnote 42 The information that the cyber defender gathers about the attacker’s techniques and modes of operation can inform a more effective counter-attack. Such cyber counter-attacks, called response actions, are part of US doctrine for defensive cyber operations. The relevant doctrinal publication defines them as ‘external to the defended network or portion of cyberspace without the permission of the owner of the affected system … normally in foreign cyberspace’. Some response actions may involve the ‘physical damage or destruction of enemy systems’. Footnote 43 Through the use of honey pots and honey nets, for instance, the defender might introduce disguised malicious code, which the attacker unwittingly extracts and incorporates into its own network. Response actions aim to ‘kill the archer’ instead of just ‘catching arrows’. Footnote 44 They are central to the more offensive aspects of ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’.\nThe use and scale of response actions depends upon the context of the attack, and the degree of actual and potential damage inflicted. The most important consideration, however, is ‘the degree of certainty in attribution of the threat’. Footnote 45 Cyber attackers make Herculean efforts to hide their identity to reduce the likelihood of retaliation. Footnote 46 To avoid escalation and diplomatic discord, it is crucial that the counter-attacker determine that its target is the actual attacker. Here the advantages of cyber defence for counter-attack come into focus. A capable cyber defender gathers extensive information on the attacker, including its methods and intentions, which, with human and other technical intelligence, can be used to arrive at the attacker’s identity. The longer the cyber defender observes the attacker, the better the overall intelligence package. In cyberspace, the best offence may emerge from a stalwart defence.\nAI and quantum computing are sometimes seen as shifting the balance in cyber warfare decisively to the offence. This seems far from certain. AI is likely be as effective on defence as it is on offence. AI is being used, for example, to develop intrusion-detection systems that ‘outperform other techniques because of their flexibility, adaptability, rapid calculations, and quick learning’. Footnote 47 While quantum computing will make it harder for defenders to encrypt their networks, cyber-security experts have begun designing essentially quantum-proof encryption. Footnote 48\nBen Buchanan argues that there is a security dilemma in the cyber domain that will drive states to engage in offensive cyber operations. The logic is that states must offensively penetrate their\npotential adversaries' networks to discover what offensive capabilities they possess; they, in turn, could interpret these intrusions as precursors to an attack or the attack itself, eliciting a cyber counter-attack and potentially triggering an escalatory spiral. Footnote  $^{49}$  Yet full consideration of the advantages of the cyber defence can dampen this logic. One key reason nation-states might engage in offensive cyber intrusions is that they think that their identity will remain hidden. But a defender who mobilises the advantages of cyber defence can use the information it gains to identify the potential attacker. Beyond that, the defender can use the information about the attacker's capabilities to launch a precisely targeted counter-attack. This capability constitutes a substantial deterrent.\nAgain, offensive capabilities are a necessary part of cyber national security, and penetrating networks will prove essential in any conflict spanning multiple domains. But defenders do not always need to attack opposing networks to develop and hone their offensive cyber capabilities. This can be done through red-teaming, which has become a common practice in network defence in cyberspace. Companies like MITRE and FireEye develop offensive cyber tools to stress-test the networks of their customers. Structurally, as cyber defence becomes stronger, offensive intrusions will require more and more resources, decreasing their efficiency over time. Money and time – the latter being a resource we can never recover – will be better spent on cyber defence. Without doubt, incentives will remain to engage in intrusions, albeit in the name of defence, but undertaking them will become increasingly risky and inefficient, and the incentives for doing so correspondingly diminished. Accordingly, the intensity of the cybersecurity dilemma is likely to decrease.\n\\*\nWe have painted a rather optimistic picture of the future of cyber defence, and we acknowledge that it is hardly guaranteed. As in conventional war, the offence-defence balance is not static. For now, however, advances in cyber-security technology have made it easier to harness the advantages of cyber defence. The balance has shifted towards the defender and is likely to shift still further in its favour. Policymakers therefore should not assume that offensive cyber operations are the most effective tools for assurance and de-escalation. Footnote  $^{50}$  A key objective of a strategy is to convince adversaries that their own strategies cannot succeed. Footnote  $^{51}$  Advertising and mobilising the advantages of the cyber defence could affect their perceptions, helping to convince them that the offensive game is not worth the candle.\nFurthermore, as Clausewitz argued, there are advantages to being on the defensive at the strategic as well as the tactical level. It is plausible that the tactical advantages of cyber defence could be scaled up to protect a strategic network of networks. There has been much hand-wringing about the havoc that minor-power adversaries such as Iran and North Korea could wreak in cyberspace. But minor-power US allies can also punch above their weight in cyberspace, and they have a vested interest in securing it. Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine have intriguingly proposed a\nvirtual alliance among technologically advanced democracies. Footnote 52 Properly organised and coordinated, they could collectively employ the tactical advantages of cyber defence to establish a formidable network of networks, prioritising defensive measures, sharing information gathered on attackers and strengthening cyber security across the board. This would be a powerful means of consolidating the defenders' advantages and deterring those who would seek to achieve cyber security through cyber attack.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Peter Wostenberg, a PhD candidate in Baylor University's Department of Political Science, for his assistance with research and revisions.",

    "## Next article": "The costs of malign behaviour on the internet are enormous. It is estimated that cyber crime will cost the global economy $10.5 trillion by 2025 – more than twice the GDP of Japan or Germany, the third- and fourth-largest economies in the world. Footnote 1 However, criminals are not the only ones profiting from the use of tools like ransomware and malware. States are building illicit revenue streams through the internet. North Korea has employed cyber attacks to steal $2 billion from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges to fund its weapons programmes. Footnote 2 In July 2021, NATO accused China of engaging in extensive cyber intrusions, most notably of the Microsoft Exchange Server. Footnote 3 Russia penetrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 in order to influence the US presidential election. More recently, Russian hackers broke into the information-technology firm SolarWinds, through which they gained access to the sensitive data of multiple US government agencies and departments. Footnote 4 It's nothing new. Footnote 5 The success of these intrusions has led many to denigrate remaining on the defensive\nin cyber and advocate unleashing offensive cyber operations. The executive and legislative branches of the US government have promoted a more aggressive approach to threats emanating from cyberspace. The Trump administration emphasised ‘defending forward’. The McCain Act gave the US military the power to penetrate foreign adversaries’ networks as a normal part of ensuring national security. Footnote 6 The second pillar of the Biden administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy is to ‘disrupt and dismantle threat actors’ in cyberspace using ‘all the instruments of national power’. Footnote 7\nWhile the language employed has been defensive in tone, it often entails offensive action. For instance, US Cyber Command characterises ‘defend forward’ as follows: ‘if a device, a network, an organization, or adversary nation is identified as a threat to US networks and institutions, or is actively attacking them in or through cyberspace – it can expect the United States to impose costs in response.’ Stating that costs will be imposed not only on those actively attacking ‘US networks and institutions’ but also those considered ‘a threat to US networks and institutions’ implies that defend forward is not passive, but has offensive elements. The same goes for ‘persistent engagement’, which Cyber Command argues shifts its ‘posture in cyberspace from reactive to proactive’ and includes efforts to ‘degrade the capabilities and networks of adversaries’. Footnote 8\nWe define an action in cyberspace as offensive if it involves gaining unauthorised access to a computer network and then using that access to extract information, cause destruction or plant malicious code. This includes cyber espionage and intelligence operations. Under this definition, ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’ are offensive. These actions may have defensive purposes, such as uncovering the offensive capabilities of an adversary to protect one’s own networks. But they are not defensive in the sense of merely seeking to strengthen a network against intrusions and responding to intrusions only when they occur.\nBefore shifting resources into offensive cyber operations, it would be prudent to consider, and to the extent possible harness, the advantages of being on the defensive. Defensive modes of warfare tend to attract less scholarly interest than their offensive counterparts. Footnote 9 Our aim is to provide a more balanced assessment of the power of defensive measures, which can help moderate calls for a highly aggressive approach to cyber security. We argue that, properly assessed, cyber defence is strong and getting stronger. We tilt towards scholars such as Thomas Rid and Erik Gartzke, who have sought to reduce alarmism about cyber capabilities among policymakers and the public. Footnote 10",
    "## The growing power of the defence": "The offence-defence literature assesses whether it is easier to attack or to defend in war, how technology and geography alter the balance between the offence and the defence, and the effects\nof this balance on international relations, especially as a cause of war. An offence-dominant world is more war-prone because even non-aggressive actors are tempted to strike first. Footnote 11 A number of scholars have tried to assess the strengths, weaknesses and implications of the balance between offence and defence in cyberspace. Footnote 12 Ben Buchanan argues that the nature of cyber capabilities produces a cybersecurity dilemma that explains the calls to unleash the cyber offence to secure the state. He notes that even states without hostile intentions must engage in offensive network penetrations to ready their cyber defences against an adversary's hidden offensive capabilities. Footnote 13 Others have argued that the relative weakness and impermanence of cyber attacks mean that offensive actions in cyber can actually ease security dilemmas. For example, resorting only to cyber attacks in response to a crisis could forestall crisis escalation and produce reassurance by signalling a country's intention not to extend warfare beyond cyberspace. Footnote 14\nOf course, the offence-defence balance can be misperceived, with disastrous consequences. Just prior to the First World War, the great powers had considerable faith in the superiority of the offence, which helped precipitate war. Footnote 15 Policymakers are now underrating the advantages of the defence, this time in cyber. According to Richard Clarke and Robert Knake, in the early days of the internet, the attacker had a distinct advantage because the internet's defences were so porous. Footnote 16 As recently as a decade ago, according to a former US National Security Agency (NSA) cryptanalyst, cyber attackers could infiltrate industrial-control systems relatively easily. Footnote 17 Today, however, the balance has begun to shift towards the defender. Footnote 18 Dave Aitel, a veteran hacker who worked for the NSA and then private cybersecurity firms, told Clarke and Knake that intrusion-detection capabilities 'actually work', which is 'a huge change'. This makes the job of the attacker much more difficult. 'For the nation-state offense', Aitel said, 'you put such a premium on not getting caught that you really don't have a huge advantage'. Footnote 19 In some ways this is unsurprising. Cyber security is one of the top ten fastest-growing fields, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with a projected growth rate of 35% over the next ten years, much higher than the projected growth rate of jobs in other fields. Footnote 20 The more resources that the government and private sector invest in cyber security, the more difficult it becomes for attackers to find soft targets. Footnote 21 The advantages of cyber defence over offence were among the findings of the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission in 2020. Footnote 22\nWhile technological shifts affect the balance between attack and defence in conventional warfare, the built-in advantages of the defence eventually tend to reassert themselves. New technologies can initially favour the attacker, but when these technologies diffuse to the defender, and the defender combines them with its inherent advantages, the attacker's initial edge often slips away. In 1940, when the German army crushed France's in six weeks, it appeared that German panzers, which seemed unstoppable, had decisively shifted the balance to the attacker's advantage.\nHowever, when the defender armed itself with the same weapons and adjusted its tactics, the balance shifted back to the defence. Later in the war, the Germans themselves demonstrated how technology had empowered the defence. In resisting the Allied advance after D-Day, the Germans used their panzers to strengthen defence-in-depth and inflicted major losses on the Allied attackers. In July 1944, for instance, during Operation Goodwood, the Germans destroyed more than a third of the British tanks brought onto the continent after the Normandy landings. Footnote 23 The difficulties Ukraine encountered in its recent counter-offensive reflected the effectiveness of Russia's prepared defence. Footnote 24 A similar arc is playing out in cyberspace.\nDespite the general recognition that defence is the stronger form of cyber warfare, investment in defensive capabilities and techniques has lagged because of the costs of implementation. That too is now changing. Defence is getting cheaper and stronger, driving up the costs of engaging in offence and strengthening deterrence. Not only are advances in network technology and security making cyber defence even stronger, but these innovations are also reducing the cost of deploying resilient cyber defence-in-depth, which some network defenders are already deploying. Some have argued that, given unlimited time and resources, the cyber attacker will always get through, affording the offence a long-term advantage. Footnote 25 But the mere fact that an attacker can gain access to a defender's computer network does not mean it will defeat the defender. The fight does not stop at the network's border. Indeed, given the speed and frequency of cyber attacks, preventing every network penetration and exploitation is impossible, and resilience is key to functionality. But many of the advantages enjoyed by the defender do not arise until after the attacker has actually gained unauthorised access to the network. With a properly organised cyber defence, networks can become more resilient, continuing to function despite penetration, while frustrating attackers' attempts to exploit their intrusion.",
    "## Conventional war vs cyber war": "Some tactical advantages of the defence in conventional ground warfare are straightforward. The defender usually fires at the oncoming attacker from behind cover. The attacker must break cover and move towards the defender to dislodge it. Consequently, the attackers must expose themselves to deadly fire to engage the defenders, who will inflict more casualties on exposed attackers than they themselves suffer. Footnote 26 These defensive advantages yield the rule of thumb that three attackers are required to subdue one defender, a ratio some have increased to six-to-one owing to the greater lethality and accuracy of new weapons. Footnote 27\nIn conventional warfare, the defender is also typically more familiar with the terrain that the attacker must traverse and has often prepared it for defence. Footnote 28 The defender will employ natural and built obstacles to channel the attacker into areas of the battlefield where it is most vulnerable to the defender's fires.

Several of the advantages that the defender in ground combat enjoys, such as superior knowledge of and preparation of the terrain, apply to the defence of computer networks. In fact, the plasticity of virtual terrain magnifies these defensive advantages. Cyber defenders are increasingly harnessing this power, improving cyber security and resilience without resort to cyber offence. The advances in cyber technology that empower the defender are becoming more widely available and affordable. In addition, the power of cyber defence and the challenges it presents to cyber offence can reduce the intensity of the cyber-security dilemma.\n## Key words:\n- Cyber attack\n- cyber defence\n- cyber offence\n- cyber security\n- defend forward\n- honey nets\n- offence-defence balance\n- persistent engagement\n- security dilemma\n- virtualisation\n## Previous article\nView issue table of contents\n## Next article\nThe costs of malign behaviour on the internet are enormous. It is estimated that cyber crime will cost the global economy $10.5 trillion by 2025 – more than twice the GDP of Japan or Germany, the third- and fourth-largest economies in the world. Footnote 1 However, criminals are not the only ones profiting from the use of tools like ransomware and malware. States are building illicit revenue streams through the internet. North Korea has employed cyber attacks to steal $2 billion from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges to fund its weapons programmes. Footnote 2 In July 2021, NATO accused China of engaging in extensive cyber intrusions, most notably of the Microsoft Exchange Server. Footnote 3 Russia penetrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 in order to influence the US presidential election. More recently, Russian hackers broke into the information-technology firm SolarWinds, through which they gained access to the sensitive data of multiple US government agencies and departments. Footnote 4 It's nothing new. Footnote 5 The success of these intrusions has led many to denigrate remaining on the defensive\nin cyber and advocate unleashing offensive cyber operations. The executive and legislative branches of the US government have promoted a more aggressive approach to threats emanating from cyberspace. The Trump administration emphasised ‘defending forward’. The McCain Act gave the US military the power to penetrate foreign adversaries’ networks as a normal part of ensuring national security. Footnote 6 The second pillar of the Biden administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy is to ‘disrupt and dismantle threat actors’ in cyberspace using ‘all the instruments of national power’. Footnote 7\nWhile the language employed has been defensive in tone, it often entails offensive action. For instance, US Cyber Command characterises ‘defend forward’ as follows: ‘if a device, a network, an organization, or adversary nation is identified as a threat to US networks and institutions, or is actively attacking them in or through cyberspace – it can expect the United States to impose costs in response.’ Stating that costs will be imposed not only on those actively attacking ‘US networks and institutions’ but also those considered ‘a threat to US networks and institutions’ implies that defend forward is not passive, but has offensive elements. The same goes for ‘persistent engagement’, which Cyber Command argues shifts its ‘posture in cyberspace from reactive to proactive’ and includes efforts to ‘degrade the capabilities and networks of adversaries’. Footnote 8\nWe define an action in cyberspace as offensive if it involves gaining unauthorised access to a computer network and then using that access to extract information, cause destruction or plant malicious code. This includes cyber espionage and intelligence operations. Under this definition, ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’ are offensive. These actions may have defensive purposes, such as uncovering the offensive capabilities of an adversary to protect one’s own networks. But they are not defensive in the sense of merely seeking to strengthen a network against intrusions and responding to intrusions only when they occur.\nBefore shifting resources into offensive cyber operations, it would be prudent to consider, and to the extent possible harness, the advantages of being on the defensive. Defensive modes of warfare tend to attract less scholarly interest than their offensive counterparts. Footnote 9 Our aim is to provide a more balanced assessment of the power of defensive measures, which can help moderate calls for a highly aggressive approach to cyber security. We argue that, properly assessed, cyber defence is strong and getting stronger. We tilt towards scholars such as Thomas Rid and Erik Gartzke, who have sought to reduce alarmism about cyber capabilities among policymakers and the public. Footnote 10\n## The growing power of the defence\nThe offence-defence literature assesses whether it is easier to attack or to defend in war, how technology and geography alter the balance between the offence and the defence, and the effects\nof this balance on international relations, especially as a cause of war. An offence-dominant world is more war-prone because even non-aggressive actors are tempted to strike first. Footnote 11 A number of scholars have tried to assess the strengths, weaknesses and implications of the balance between offence and defence in cyberspace. Footnote 12 Ben Buchanan argues that the nature of cyber capabilities produces a cybersecurity dilemma that explains the calls to unleash the cyber offence to secure the state. He notes that even states without hostile intentions must engage in offensive network penetrations to ready their cyber defences against an adversary's hidden offensive capabilities. Footnote 13 Others have argued that the relative weakness and impermanence of cyber attacks mean that offensive actions in cyber can actually ease security dilemmas. For example, resorting only to cyber attacks in response to a crisis could forestall crisis escalation and produce reassurance by signalling a country's intention not to extend warfare beyond cyberspace. Footnote 14\nOf course, the offence-defence balance can be misperceived, with disastrous consequences. Just prior to the First World War, the great powers had considerable faith in the superiority of the offence, which helped precipitate war. Footnote 15 Policymakers are now underrating the advantages of the defence, this time in cyber. According to Richard Clarke and Robert Knake, in the early days of the internet, the attacker had a distinct advantage because the internet's defences were so porous. Footnote 16 As recently as a decade ago, according to a former US National Security Agency (NSA) cryptanalyst, cyber attackers could infiltrate industrial-control systems relatively easily. Footnote 17 Today, however, the balance has begun to shift towards the defender. Footnote 18 Dave Aitel, a veteran hacker who worked for the NSA and then private cybersecurity firms, told Clarke and Knake that intrusion-detection capabilities 'actually work', which is 'a huge change'. This makes the job of the attacker much more difficult. 'For the nation-state offense', Aitel said, 'you put such a premium on not getting caught that you really don't have a huge advantage'. Footnote 19 In some ways this is unsurprising. Cyber security is one of the top ten fastest-growing fields, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with a projected growth rate of 35% over the next ten years, much higher than the projected growth rate of jobs in other fields. Footnote 20 The more resources that the government and private sector invest in cyber security, the more difficult it becomes for attackers to find soft targets. Footnote 21 The advantages of cyber defence over offence were among the findings of the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission in 2020. Footnote 22\nWhile technological shifts affect the balance between attack and defence in conventional warfare, the built-in advantages of the defence eventually tend to reassert themselves. New technologies can initially favour the attacker, but when these technologies diffuse to the defender, and the defender combines them with its inherent advantages, the attacker's initial edge often slips away. In 1940, when the German army crushed France's in six weeks, it appeared that German panzers, which seemed unstoppable, had decisively shifted the balance to the attacker's advantage.\nHowever, when the defender armed itself with the same weapons and adjusted its tactics, the balance shifted back to the defence. Later in the war, the Germans themselves demonstrated how technology had empowered the defence. In resisting the Allied advance after D-Day, the Germans used their panzers to strengthen defence-in-depth and inflicted major losses on the Allied attackers. In July 1944, for instance, during Operation Goodwood, the Germans destroyed more than a third of the British tanks brought onto the continent after the Normandy landings. Footnote 23 The difficulties Ukraine encountered in its recent counter-offensive reflected the effectiveness of Russia's prepared defence. Footnote 24 A similar arc is playing out in cyberspace.\nDespite the general recognition that defence is the stronger form of cyber warfare, investment in defensive capabilities and techniques has lagged because of the costs of implementation. That too is now changing. Defence is getting cheaper and stronger, driving up the costs of engaging in offence and strengthening deterrence. Not only are advances in network technology and security making cyber defence even stronger, but these innovations are also reducing the cost of deploying resilient cyber defence-in-depth, which some network defenders are already deploying. Some have argued that, given unlimited time and resources, the cyber attacker will always get through, affording the offence a long-term advantage. Footnote 25 But the mere fact that an attacker can gain access to a defender's computer network does not mean it will defeat the defender. The fight does not stop at the network's border. Indeed, given the speed and frequency of cyber attacks, preventing every network penetration and exploitation is impossible, and resilience is key to functionality. But many of the advantages enjoyed by the defender do not arise until after the attacker has actually gained unauthorised access to the network. With a properly organised cyber defence, networks can become more resilient, continuing to function despite penetration, while frustrating attackers' attempts to exploit their intrusion.\n## Conventional war vs cyber war\nSome tactical advantages of the defence in conventional ground warfare are straightforward. The defender usually fires at the oncoming attacker from behind cover. The attacker must break cover and move towards the defender to dislodge it. Consequently, the attackers must expose themselves to deadly fire to engage the defenders, who will inflict more casualties on exposed attackers than they themselves suffer. Footnote 26 These defensive advantages yield the rule of thumb that three attackers are required to subdue one defender, a ratio some have increased to six-to-one owing to the greater lethality and accuracy of new weapons. Footnote 27\nIn conventional warfare, the defender is also typically more familiar with the terrain that the attacker must traverse and has often prepared it for defence. Footnote 28 The defender will employ natural and built obstacles to channel the attacker into areas of the battlefield where it is most vulnerable to the defender's fires. Through such preparations, the defender can seize the\ninitiative. When an attacker penetrates a well-prepared defence-in-depth, it is often following to the defender's script. In that case, the defender, not the attacker, can dictate the terms of engagement. Moreover, a stalwart defence-in-depth can produce victory by so frustrating an attacker that it breaks off the attack. During the Cold War, the US Army – a force steeped in the virtues of the offence but then insuperably outnumbered by Soviet conventional forces in Europe – rediscovered the virtues of the defensive, crystallising them in its doctrines of Active Defense and AirLand Battle. Footnote 29\nIn the cyber realm too, defenders typically have better knowledge of the terrain – the network they are defending – than attackers. Today, this awareness is increased through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to map the network's terrain and detect anomalous behaviour. Footnote 30 Employing AI in cyber defence is essential because the sheer volume and speed of attacks mean that individual cyber defenders cannot possibly detect and address each one. Footnote 31 The terrain of cyberspace, however, is different from the natural battlespace that is shaped by the defender in ground combat. Cyberspace has far greater plasticity than physical space, offering the defender more options in preparing the battlespace. Footnote 32\nGaining unauthorised access to a network is only the first step for the attacker. It must still find what it is looking for, which calls for mapping the network. This is why hackers often spend so much time inside a network before moving to exploitation. Russian hackers were inside the network of the DNC for months before they exfiltrated the batch of internal email communications that caused such a stir. Footnote 33 Once in the network, of course, the attacker is on the defender's terrain. However, a computer network is not like a terrain feature on a battlefield. It would be impossible for a conventional defender to make forests spring up where once there were plains or to render valleys smooth and bring mountains low. The defender in cyberspace, however, can do something comparable, altering the digital ground under the attacker's feet by changing the configuration of its network, thus preserving its superior situational awareness. Footnote 34 Such techniques can frustrate the attacker into breaking off its attack. Even if they don't, when the defender of a network periodically alters the configuration of the network, attackers that have managed to avoid detection and are assiduously mapping the network for exploitation will find that their data has become outdated. The harder it is to map a network, the longer the attacker must stay in the system, increasing the likelihood that it will be discovered. Furthermore, if the attacker has manipulated part of the network to hide its presence, reconfiguring the network can expose its hideout when it fails to change with the rest of the network.\nCyber defenders are already using some of these defensive tactics. For instance, the health-insurance company Aetna's cyber defenders routinely change aspects of its network so that attackers are never certain about their position within it, retaining their home-court advantage. Footnote 35 Intentional network manipulation is also getting easier by virtue of cloud-\ninfrastructure virtualisation. Devices are virtualised and typically provided as services, which means that there is nothing physical to purchase, house, wire, power or cool. A cloud provider such as Amazon maintains the virtual device, and users simply configure it to their specifications. The elements physically exposed to the internet are owned, operated and defended by the cloud provider. The flexibility this affords to shape the terrain is immense. In fact, virtualisation allows the cyber defender to change the shape of the terrain during an attack to frustrate the attacker. Footnote 36 The network that can change its configuration is a more resilient network, which is especially important for military forces that need to fend off virtual attackers while simultaneously fighting physical adversaries.\nFew companies have a cyber-defence budget the size of Aetna's, and in the past few could mount an elaborate defence. But now that the components of a network are owned, operated and defended by the likes of Amazon, economies of scale make the resources and expertise necessary to mount a formidable cyber defence-in-depth within reach of an expanding range of national governments, local governments and private companies.\nFinally, even if a cyber attack is successful, virtualisation facilitates quick recovery. It is much easier to load a pre-attack version of a virtual machine, patch its vulnerabilities and return it to service than it is to restore a physical computer to an earlier state. Virtualisation may also mean that defenders have access to a wider array of online resources to deal with distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nCyber attackers, of course, can also manipulate the virtual terrain of the network they have infiltrated. But defenders are still countering from their own territory, and their superior control and knowledge of the network means that they know the inventory and can detect changes through relatively simple means, such as white lists. Defenders can also embed responses triggered when behaviour outside of the network's established norms occurs that morphs the network and isolates the attacker. The defender still enjoys significant home-field advantages.\n# Observing the attacker\nIn ground combat, the defender can observe the approach of an attacker while remaining concealed, gathering information on capabilities and intentions. Footnote 37 The defender of a computer network can do the same. The informational advantages increase when the network defender also reconfigures the network. In facilitating the defender's search for technical signatures, these defensive advantages can also help it overcome one of the thorniest problems in cyberspace: the attacker's anonymity. With these advantages in mind, the cyber-security firm MITRE has decided that it would not make its primary objective to eject attackers from the network. Instead, it isolates and observes attackers in its system to learn about the tools they are\nusing and to waste the time of the attacker, which often has no idea that it is under observation or that it has lost the initiative.\nThe intelligence-gathering capacity of the defender increases dramatically when it exploits the malleability of the virtual landscape by establishing fake machines, known as 'honey pots', or entire fictitious networks, called 'honey nets', on its network. To draw another conventional-warfare analogy, in the Second World War, the Germans would leave the first few defensive positions that they constructed empty. Unaware of this, the attacker would deploy to breach these phantom positions. Concealed German scouts would observe this action and communicate tactical intelligence about artillery, air support and other factors to the defenders in the inhabited positions. Likewise, the cyber defender can build fake computers and networks populated with fake data to fool the attacker, and even malicious code to infect it. Footnote  $^{38}$  Moreover, because honey nets are quiet networks with very little traffic, the defender can identify any intrusion as the work of a malicious actor. At no time would the actual home network be in danger. The intruder, for its part, would remain ignorant of the fact that the stalwart defence it is confronting is not there to protect the defender's actual network. Perhaps the most important resources that the attacker wastes in breaching a honey net are exploitation tools. Once it uses one, the defender can patch against that tool in its home network, inoculating it against that exploit. In addition, honey nets can potentially contribute to cyber resilience. If the attacker diverts resources to a honey net, it is not in the real network disrupting its normal operations, reducing the degradation of the network and allowing normal operations to continue despite the presence of an intruder.\nThe extensive information obtained in defending a false network can also empower AI tools being used in a detection and defence role in the defender's real network. In order for AI to learn what to defend against, it needs data on previous attacks, and it is vital that this data be constantly updated. AI can work from the data generated from the defence of the honey net to defend the real network, detect intrusion attempts against it, and identify the intruder based on the kinds of exploitation tools it uses and other signatures. AI might even be able to predict the next move of the attacker. Footnote 39\nFinally, many, perhaps most, decisions about cyber security in both the private and public sectors are financial. If the projected losses from intrusions are lower than the cost of providing security, then governments and countries will forgo the security upgrade. For instance, prior to the 2016 election, a cyber-security consultant told the DNC that its computer network was vulnerable. Rather than spend resources on a cyber-security upgrade, the DNC decided to allocate the resources that would have required to increasing voter turnout – a decision they would come to regret. Footnote  $^{40}$  The virtualisation of computer networks has reduced the cost of building honey nets, and this service is now provided by several cyber-security firms. Footnote  $^{41}$\n# The offence–defence balance and the cyber-security dilemma\nSometimes the only way to stop a persistent attacker is to counter-attack and disrupt its ability to keep attacking. Offensive as well as defensive cyber capabilities will unavoidably be part of any major conflict. But it's important to remember that defence is not entirely inactive. As Carl von Clausewitz noted almost 200 years ago, ‘the defensive form of war is not a simple shield, but a shield made up of well-directed blows’. Footnote 42 The information that the cyber defender gathers about the attacker’s techniques and modes of operation can inform a more effective counter-attack. Such cyber counter-attacks, called response actions, are part of US doctrine for defensive cyber operations. The relevant doctrinal publication defines them as ‘external to the defended network or portion of cyberspace without the permission of the owner of the affected system … normally in foreign cyberspace’. Some response actions may involve the ‘physical damage or destruction of enemy systems’. Footnote 43 Through the use of honey pots and honey nets, for instance, the defender might introduce disguised malicious code, which the attacker unwittingly extracts and incorporates into its own network. Response actions aim to ‘kill the archer’ instead of just ‘catching arrows’. Footnote 44 They are central to the more offensive aspects of ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’.\nThe use and scale of response actions depends upon the context of the attack, and the degree of actual and potential damage inflicted. The most important consideration, however, is ‘the degree of certainty in attribution of the threat’. Footnote 45 Cyber attackers make Herculean efforts to hide their identity to reduce the likelihood of retaliation. Footnote 46 To avoid escalation and diplomatic discord, it is crucial that the counter-attacker determine that its target is the actual attacker. Here the advantages of cyber defence for counter-attack come into focus. A capable cyber defender gathers extensive information on the attacker, including its methods and intentions, which, with human and other technical intelligence, can be used to arrive at the attacker’s identity. The longer the cyber defender observes the attacker, the better the overall intelligence package. In cyberspace, the best offence may emerge from a stalwart defence.\nAI and quantum computing are sometimes seen as shifting the balance in cyber warfare decisively to the offence. This seems far from certain. AI is likely be as effective on defence as it is on offence. AI is being used, for example, to develop intrusion-detection systems that ‘outperform other techniques because of their flexibility, adaptability, rapid calculations, and quick learning’. Footnote 47 While quantum computing will make it harder for defenders to encrypt their networks, cyber-security experts have begun designing essentially quantum-proof encryption. Footnote 48\nBen Buchanan argues that there is a security dilemma in the cyber domain that will drive states to engage in offensive cyber operations.

      "flat_text": "# Abstract\nApprehension about cyber insecurity can be reduced by taking into account the growing power of defence in cyberspace. The cyber defender is strong and getting stronger. Several of the advantages that the defender in ground combat enjoys, such as superior knowledge of and preparation of the terrain, apply to the defence of computer networks. In fact, the plasticity of virtual terrain magnifies these defensive advantages. Cyber defenders are increasingly harnessing this power, improving cyber security and resilience without resort to cyber offence. The advances in cyber technology that empower the defender are becoming more widely available and affordable. In addition, the power of cyber defence and the challenges it presents to cyber offence can reduce the intensity of the cyber-security dilemma.\n## Key words:\n- Cyber attack\n- cyber defence\n- cyber offence\n- cyber security\n- defend forward\n- honey nets\n- offence-defence balance\n- persistent engagement\n- security dilemma\n- virtualisation\n## Previous article\nView issue table of contents\n## Next article\nThe costs of malign behaviour on the internet are enormous. It is estimated that cyber crime will cost the global economy $10.5 trillion by 2025 – more than twice the GDP of Japan or Germany, the third- and fourth-largest economies in the world. Footnote 1 However, criminals are not the only ones profiting from the use of tools like ransomware and malware. States are building illicit revenue streams through the internet. North Korea has employed cyber attacks to steal $2 billion from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges to fund its weapons programmes. Footnote 2 In July 2021, NATO accused China of engaging in extensive cyber intrusions, most notably of the Microsoft Exchange Server. Footnote 3 Russia penetrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 in order to influence the US presidential election. More recently, Russian hackers broke into the information-technology firm SolarWinds, through which they gained access to the sensitive data of multiple US government agencies and departments. Footnote 4 It's nothing new. Footnote 5 The success of these intrusions has led many to denigrate remaining on the defensive\nin cyber and advocate unleashing offensive cyber operations. The executive and legislative branches of the US government have promoted a more aggressive approach to threats emanating from cyberspace. The Trump administration emphasised ‘defending forward’. The McCain Act gave the US military the power to penetrate foreign adversaries’ networks as a normal part of ensuring national security. Footnote 6 The second pillar of the Biden administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy is to ‘disrupt and dismantle threat actors’ in cyberspace using ‘all the instruments of national power’. Footnote 7\nWhile the language employed has been defensive in tone, it often entails offensive action. For instance, US Cyber Command characterises ‘defend forward’ as follows: ‘if a device, a network, an organization, or adversary nation is identified as a threat to US networks and institutions, or is actively attacking them in or through cyberspace – it can expect the United States to impose costs in response.’ Stating that costs will be imposed not only on those actively attacking ‘US networks and institutions’ but also those considered ‘a threat to US networks and institutions’ implies that defend forward is not passive, but has offensive elements. The same goes for ‘persistent engagement’, which Cyber Command argues shifts its ‘posture in cyberspace from reactive to proactive’ and includes efforts to ‘degrade the capabilities and networks of adversaries’. Footnote 8\nWe define an action in cyberspace as offensive if it involves gaining unauthorised access to a computer network and then using that access to extract information, cause destruction or plant malicious code. This includes cyber espionage and intelligence operations. Under this definition, ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’ are offensive. These actions may have defensive purposes, such as uncovering the offensive capabilities of an adversary to protect one’s own networks. But they are not defensive in the sense of merely seeking to strengthen a network against intrusions and responding to intrusions only when they occur.\nBefore shifting resources into offensive cyber operations, it would be prudent to consider, and to the extent possible harness, the advantages of being on the defensive. Defensive modes of warfare tend to attract less scholarly interest than their offensive counterparts. Footnote 9 Our aim is to provide a more balanced assessment of the power of defensive measures, which can help moderate calls for a highly aggressive approach to cyber security. We argue that, properly assessed, cyber defence is strong and getting stronger. We tilt towards scholars such as Thomas Rid and Erik Gartzke, who have sought to reduce alarmism about cyber capabilities among policymakers and the public. Footnote 10\n## The growing power of the defence\nThe offence-defence literature assesses whether it is easier to attack or to defend in war, how technology and geography alter the balance between the offence and the defence, and the effects\nof this balance on international relations, especially as a cause of war. An offence-dominant world is more war-prone because even non-aggressive actors are tempted to strike first. Footnote 11 A number of scholars have tried to assess the strengths, weaknesses and implications of the balance between offence and defence in cyberspace. Footnote 12 Ben Buchanan argues that the nature of cyber capabilities produces a cybersecurity dilemma that explains the calls to unleash the cyber offence to secure the state. He notes that even states without hostile intentions must engage in offensive network penetrations to ready their cyber defences against an adversary's hidden offensive capabilities. Footnote 13 Others have argued that the relative weakness and impermanence of cyber attacks mean that offensive actions in cyber can actually ease security dilemmas. For example, resorting only to cyber attacks in response to a crisis could forestall crisis escalation and produce reassurance by signalling a country's intention not to extend warfare beyond cyberspace. Footnote 14\nOf course, the offence-defence balance can be misperceived, with disastrous consequences. Just prior to the First World War, the great powers had considerable faith in the superiority of the offence, which helped precipitate war. Footnote 15 Policymakers are now underrating the advantages of the defence, this time in cyber. According to Richard Clarke and Robert Knake, in the early days of the internet, the attacker had a distinct advantage because the internet's defences were so porous. Footnote 16 As recently as a decade ago, according to a former US National Security Agency (NSA) cryptanalyst, cyber attackers could infiltrate industrial-control systems relatively easily. Footnote 17 Today, however, the balance has begun to shift towards the defender. Footnote 18 Dave Aitel, a veteran hacker who worked for the NSA and then private cybersecurity firms, told Clarke and Knake that intrusion-detection capabilities 'actually work', which is 'a huge change'. This makes the job of the attacker much more difficult. 'For the nation-state offense', Aitel said, 'you put such a premium on not getting caught that you really don't have a huge advantage'. Footnote 19 In some ways this is unsurprising. Cyber security is one of the top ten fastest-growing fields, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with a projected growth rate of 35% over the next ten years, much higher than the projected growth rate of jobs in other fields. Footnote 20 The more resources that the government and private sector invest in cyber security, the more difficult it becomes for attackers to find soft targets. Footnote 21 The advantages of cyber defence over offence were among the findings of the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission in 2020. Footnote 22\nWhile technological shifts affect the balance between attack and defence in conventional warfare, the built-in advantages of the defence eventually tend to reassert themselves. New technologies can initially favour the attacker, but when these technologies diffuse to the defender, and the defender combines them with its inherent advantages, the attacker's initial edge often slips away. In 1940, when the German army crushed France's in six weeks, it appeared that German panzers, which seemed unstoppable, had decisively shifted the balance to the attacker's advantage.\nHowever, when the defender armed itself with the same weapons and adjusted its tactics, the balance shifted back to the defence. Later in the war, the Germans themselves demonstrated how technology had empowered the defence. In resisting the Allied advance after D-Day, the Germans used their panzers to strengthen defence-in-depth and inflicted major losses on the Allied attackers. In July 1944, for instance, during Operation Goodwood, the Germans destroyed more than a third of the British tanks brought onto the continent after the Normandy landings. Footnote 23 The difficulties Ukraine encountered in its recent counter-offensive reflected the effectiveness of Russia's prepared defence. Footnote 24 A similar arc is playing out in cyberspace.\nDespite the general recognition that defence is the stronger form of cyber warfare, investment in defensive capabilities and techniques has lagged because of the costs of implementation. That too is now changing. Defence is getting cheaper and stronger, driving up the costs of engaging in offence and strengthening deterrence. Not only are advances in network technology and security making cyber defence even stronger, but these innovations are also reducing the cost of deploying resilient cyber defence-in-depth, which some network defenders are already deploying. Some have argued that, given unlimited time and resources, the cyber attacker will always get through, affording the offence a long-term advantage. Footnote 25 But the mere fact that an attacker can gain access to a defender's computer network does not mean it will defeat the defender. The fight does not stop at the network's border. Indeed, given the speed and frequency of cyber attacks, preventing every network penetration and exploitation is impossible, and resilience is key to functionality. But many of the advantages enjoyed by the defender do not arise until after the attacker has actually gained unauthorised access to the network. With a properly organised cyber defence, networks can become more resilient, continuing to function despite penetration, while frustrating attackers' attempts to exploit their intrusion.\n## Conventional war vs cyber war\nSome tactical advantages of the defence in conventional ground warfare are straightforward. The defender usually fires at the oncoming attacker from behind cover. The attacker must break cover and move towards the defender to dislodge it. Consequently, the attackers must expose themselves to deadly fire to engage the defenders, who will inflict more casualties on exposed attackers than they themselves suffer. Footnote 26 These defensive advantages yield the rule of thumb that three attackers are required to subdue one defender, a ratio some have increased to six-to-one owing to the greater lethality and accuracy of new weapons. Footnote 27\nIn conventional warfare, the defender is also typically more familiar with the terrain that the attacker must traverse and has often prepared it for defence. Footnote 28 The defender will employ natural and built obstacles to channel the attacker into areas of the battlefield where it is most vulnerable to the defender's fires. Through such preparations, the defender can seize the\ninitiative. When an attacker penetrates a well-prepared defence-in-depth, it is often following to the defender's script. In that case, the defender, not the attacker, can dictate the terms of engagement. Moreover, a stalwart defence-in-depth can produce victory by so frustrating an attacker that it breaks off the attack. During the Cold War, the US Army – a force steeped in the virtues of the offence but then insuperably outnumbered by Soviet conventional forces in Europe – rediscovered the virtues of the defensive, crystallising them in its doctrines of Active Defense and AirLand Battle. Footnote 29\nIn the cyber realm too, defenders typically have better knowledge of the terrain – the network they are defending – than attackers. Today, this awareness is increased through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to map the network's terrain and detect anomalous behaviour. Footnote 30 Employing AI in cyber defence is essential because the sheer volume and speed of attacks mean that individual cyber defenders cannot possibly detect and address each one. Footnote 31 The terrain of cyberspace, however, is different from the natural battlespace that is shaped by the defender in ground combat. Cyberspace has far greater plasticity than physical space, offering the defender more options in preparing the battlespace. Footnote 32\nGaining unauthorised access to a network is only the first step for the attacker. It must still find what it is looking for, which calls for mapping the network. This is why hackers often spend so much time inside a network before moving to exploitation. Russian hackers were inside the network of the DNC for months before they exfiltrated the batch of internal email communications that caused such a stir. Footnote 33 Once in the network, of course, the attacker is on the defender's terrain. However, a computer network is not like a terrain feature on a battlefield. It would be impossible for a conventional defender to make forests spring up where once there were plains or to render valleys smooth and bring mountains low. The defender in cyberspace, however, can do something comparable, altering the digital ground under the attacker's feet by changing the configuration of its network, thus preserving its superior situational awareness. Footnote 34 Such techniques can frustrate the attacker into breaking off its attack. Even if they don't, when the defender of a network periodically alters the configuration of the network, attackers that have managed to avoid detection and are assiduously mapping the network for exploitation will find that their data has become outdated. The harder it is to map a network, the longer the attacker must stay in the system, increasing the likelihood that it will be discovered. Furthermore, if the attacker has manipulated part of the network to hide its presence, reconfiguring the network can expose its hideout when it fails to change with the rest of the network.\nCyber defenders are already using some of these defensive tactics. For instance, the health-insurance company Aetna's cyber defenders routinely change aspects of its network so that attackers are never certain about their position within it, retaining their home-court advantage. Footnote 35 Intentional network manipulation is also getting easier by virtue of cloud-\ninfrastructure virtualisation. Devices are virtualised and typically provided as services, which means that there is nothing physical to purchase, house, wire, power or cool. A cloud provider such as Amazon maintains the virtual device, and users simply configure it to their specifications. The elements physically exposed to the internet are owned, operated and defended by the cloud provider. The flexibility this affords to shape the terrain is immense. In fact, virtualisation allows the cyber defender to change the shape of the terrain during an attack to frustrate the attacker. Footnote 36 The network that can change its configuration is a more resilient network, which is especially important for military forces that need to fend off virtual attackers while simultaneously fighting physical adversaries.\nFew companies have a cyber-defence budget the size of Aetna's, and in the past few could mount an elaborate defence. But now that the components of a network are owned, operated and defended by the likes of Amazon, economies of scale make the resources and expertise necessary to mount a formidable cyber defence-in-depth within reach of an expanding range of national governments, local governments and private companies.\nFinally, even if a cyber attack is successful, virtualisation facilitates quick recovery. It is much easier to load a pre-attack version of a virtual machine, patch its vulnerabilities and return it to service than it is to restore a physical computer to an earlier state. Virtualisation may also mean that defenders have access to a wider array of online resources to deal with distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nCyber attackers, of course, can also manipulate the virtual terrain of the network they have infiltrated. But defenders are still countering from their own territory, and their superior control and knowledge of the network means that they know the inventory and can detect changes through relatively simple means, such as white lists. Defenders can also embed responses triggered when behaviour outside of the network's established norms occurs that morphs the network and isolates the attacker. The defender still enjoys significant home-field advantages.\n# Observing the attacker\nIn ground combat, the defender can observe the approach of an attacker while remaining concealed, gathering information on capabilities and intentions. Footnote 37 The defender of a computer network can do the same. The informational advantages increase when the network defender also reconfigures the network. In facilitating the defender's search for technical signatures, these defensive advantages can also help it overcome one of the thorniest problems in cyberspace: the attacker's anonymity. With these advantages in mind, the cyber-security firm MITRE has decided that it would not make its primary objective to eject attackers from the network. Instead, it isolates and observes attackers in its system to learn about the tools they are\nusing and to waste the time of the attacker, which often has no idea that it is under observation or that it has lost the initiative.\nThe intelligence-gathering capacity of the defender increases dramatically when it exploits the malleability of the virtual landscape by establishing fake machines, known as 'honey pots', or entire fictitious networks, called 'honey nets', on its network. To draw another conventional-warfare analogy, in the Second World War, the Germans would leave the first few defensive positions that they constructed empty. Unaware of this, the attacker would deploy to breach these phantom positions. Concealed German scouts would observe this action and communicate tactical intelligence about artillery, air support and other factors to the defenders in the inhabited positions. Likewise, the cyber defender can build fake computers and networks populated with fake data to fool the attacker, and even malicious code to infect it. Footnote  $^{38}$  Moreover, because honey nets are quiet networks with very little traffic, the defender can identify any intrusion as the work of a malicious actor. At no time would the actual home network be in danger. The intruder, for its part, would remain ignorant of the fact that the stalwart defence it is confronting is not there to protect the defender's actual network. Perhaps the most important resources that the attacker wastes in breaching a honey net are exploitation tools. Once it uses one, the defender can patch against that tool in its home network, inoculating it against that exploit. In addition, honey nets can potentially contribute to cyber resilience. If the attacker diverts resources to a honey net, it is not in the real network disrupting its normal operations, reducing the degradation of the network and allowing normal operations to continue despite the presence of an intruder.\nThe extensive information obtained in defending a false network can also empower AI tools being used in a detection and defence role in the defender's real network. In order for AI to learn what to defend against, it needs data on previous attacks, and it is vital that this data be constantly updated. AI can work from the data generated from the defence of the honey net to defend the real network, detect intrusion attempts against it, and identify the intruder based on the kinds of exploitation tools it uses and other signatures. AI might even be able to predict the next move of the attacker. Footnote 39\nFinally, many, perhaps most, decisions about cyber security in both the private and public sectors are financial. If the projected losses from intrusions are lower than the cost of providing security, then governments and countries will forgo the security upgrade. For instance, prior to the 2016 election, a cyber-security consultant told the DNC that its computer network was vulnerable. Rather than spend resources on a cyber-security upgrade, the DNC decided to allocate the resources that would have required to increasing voter turnout – a decision they would come to regret. Footnote  $^{40}$  The virtualisation of computer networks has reduced the cost of building honey nets, and this service is now provided by several cyber-security firms. Footnote  $^{41}$\n# The offence–defence balance and the cyber-security dilemma\nSometimes the only way to stop a persistent attacker is to counter-attack and disrupt its ability to keep attacking. Offensive as well as defensive cyber capabilities will unavoidably be part of any major conflict. But it's important to remember that defence is not entirely inactive. As Carl von Clausewitz noted almost 200 years ago, ‘the defensive form of war is not a simple shield, but a shield made up of well-directed blows’. Footnote 42 The information that the cyber defender gathers about the attacker’s techniques and modes of operation can inform a more effective counter-attack. Such cyber counter-attacks, called response actions, are part of US doctrine for defensive cyber operations. The relevant doctrinal publication defines them as ‘external to the defended network or portion of cyberspace without the permission of the owner of the affected system … normally in foreign cyberspace’. Some response actions may involve the ‘physical damage or destruction of enemy systems’. Footnote 43 Through the use of honey pots and honey nets, for instance, the defender might introduce disguised malicious code, which the attacker unwittingly extracts and incorporates into its own network. Response actions aim to ‘kill the archer’ instead of just ‘catching arrows’. Footnote 44 They are central to the more offensive aspects of ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’.\nThe use and scale of response actions depends upon the context of the attack, and the degree of actual and potential damage inflicted. The most important consideration, however, is ‘the degree of certainty in attribution of the threat’. Footnote 45 Cyber attackers make Herculean efforts to hide their identity to reduce the likelihood of retaliation. Footnote 46 To avoid escalation and diplomatic discord, it is crucial that the counter-attacker determine that its target is the actual attacker. Here the advantages of cyber defence for counter-attack come into focus. A capable cyber defender gathers extensive information on the attacker, including its methods and intentions, which, with human and other technical intelligence, can be used to arrive at the attacker’s identity. The longer the cyber defender observes the attacker, the better the overall intelligence package. In cyberspace, the best offence may emerge from a stalwart defence.\nAI and quantum computing are sometimes seen as shifting the balance in cyber warfare decisively to the offence. This seems far from certain. AI is likely be as effective on defence as it is on offence. AI is being used, for example, to develop intrusion-detection systems that ‘outperform other techniques because of their flexibility, adaptability, rapid calculations, and quick learning’. Footnote 47 While quantum computing will make it harder for defenders to encrypt their networks, cyber-security experts have begun designing essentially quantum-proof encryption. Footnote 48\nBen Buchanan argues that there is a security dilemma in the cyber domain that will drive states to engage in offensive cyber operations. The logic is that states must offensively penetrate their\npotential adversaries' networks to discover what offensive capabilities they possess; they, in turn, could interpret these intrusions as precursors to an attack or the attack itself, eliciting a cyber counter-attack and potentially triggering an escalatory spiral. Footnote  $^{49}$  Yet full consideration of the advantages of the cyber defence can dampen this logic. One key reason nation-states might engage in offensive cyber intrusions is that they think that their identity will remain hidden. But a defender who mobilises the advantages of cyber defence can use the information it gains to identify the potential attacker. Beyond that, the defender can use the information about the attacker's capabilities to launch a precisely targeted counter-attack. This capability constitutes a substantial deterrent.\nAgain, offensive capabilities are a necessary part of cyber national security, and penetrating networks will prove essential in any conflict spanning multiple domains. But defenders do not always need to attack opposing networks to develop and hone their offensive cyber capabilities. This can be done through red-teaming, which has become a common practice in network defence in cyberspace. Companies like MITRE and FireEye develop offensive cyber tools to stress-test the networks of their customers.

Footnote 8\nWe define an action in cyberspace as offensive if it involves gaining unauthorised access to a computer network and then using that access to extract information, cause destruction or plant malicious code.

Footnote 10\n## The growing power of the defence\nThe offence-defence literature assesses whether it is easier to attack or to defend in war, how technology and geography alter the balance between the offence and the defence, and the effects\nof this balance on international relations, especially as a cause of war. An offence-dominant world is more war-prone because even non-aggressive actors are tempted to strike first. Footnote 11 A number of scholars have tried to assess the strengths, weaknesses and implications of the balance between offence and defence in cyberspace. Footnote 12 Ben Buchanan argues that the nature of cyber capabilities produces a cybersecurity dilemma that explains the calls to unleash the cyber offence to secure the state. He notes that even states without hostile intentions must engage in offensive network penetrations to ready their cyber defences against an adversary's hidden offensive capabilities. Footnote 13 Others have argued that the relative weakness and impermanence of cyber attacks mean that offensive actions in cyber can actually ease security dilemmas. For example, resorting only to cyber attacks in response to a crisis could forestall crisis escalation and produce reassurance by signalling a country's intention not to extend warfare beyond cyberspace. Footnote 14\nOf course, the offence-defence balance can be misperceived, with disastrous consequences. Just prior to the First World War, the great powers had considerable faith in the superiority of the offence, which helped precipitate war. Footnote 15 Policymakers are now underrating the advantages of the defence, this time in cyber. According to Richard Clarke and Robert Knake, in the early days of the internet, the attacker had a distinct advantage because the internet's defences were so porous. Footnote 16 As recently as a decade ago, according to a former US National Security Agency (NSA) cryptanalyst, cyber attackers could infiltrate industrial-control systems relatively easily. Footnote 17 Today, however, the balance has begun to shift towards the defender. Footnote 18 Dave Aitel, a veteran hacker who worked for the NSA and then private cybersecurity firms, told Clarke and Knake that intrusion-detection capabilities 'actually work', which is 'a huge change'. This makes the job of the attacker much more difficult. 'For the nation-state offense', Aitel said, 'you put such a premium on not getting caught that you really don't have a huge advantage'. Footnote 19 In some ways this is unsurprising. Cyber security is one of the top ten fastest-growing fields, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with a projected growth rate of 35% over the next ten years, much higher than the projected growth rate of jobs in other fields. Footnote 20 The more resources that the government and private sector invest in cyber security, the more difficult it becomes for attackers to find soft targets. Footnote 21 The advantages of cyber defence over offence were among the findings of the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission in 2020. Footnote 22\nWhile technological shifts affect the balance between attack and defence in conventional warfare, the built-in advantages of the defence eventually tend to reassert themselves. New technologies can initially favour the attacker, but when these technologies diffuse to the defender, and the defender combines them with its inherent advantages, the attacker's initial edge often slips away. In 1940, when the German army crushed France's in six weeks, it appeared that German panzers, which seemed unstoppable, had decisively shifted the balance to the attacker's advantage.\nHowever, when the defender armed itself with the same weapons and adjusted its tactics, the balance shifted back to the defence. Later in the war, the Germans themselves demonstrated how technology had empowered the defence. In resisting the Allied advance after D-Day, the Germans used their panzers to strengthen defence-in-depth and inflicted major losses on the Allied attackers. In July 1944, for instance, during Operation Goodwood, the Germans destroyed more than a third of the British tanks brought onto the continent after the Normandy landings. Footnote 23 The difficulties Ukraine encountered in its recent counter-offensive reflected the effectiveness of Russia's prepared defence. Footnote 24 A similar arc is playing out in cyberspace.\nDespite the general recognition that defence is the stronger form of cyber warfare, investment in defensive capabilities and techniques has lagged because of the costs of implementation. That too is now changing. Defence is getting cheaper and stronger, driving up the costs of engaging in offence and strengthening deterrence. Not only are advances in network technology and security making cyber defence even stronger, but these innovations are also reducing the cost of deploying resilient cyber defence-in-depth, which some network defenders are already deploying. Some have argued that, given unlimited time and resources, the cyber attacker will always get through, affording the offence a long-term advantage. Footnote 25 But the mere fact that an attacker can gain access to a defender's computer network does not mean it will defeat the defender. The fight does not stop at the network's border. Indeed, given the speed and frequency of cyber attacks, preventing every network penetration and exploitation is impossible, and resilience is key to functionality. But many of the advantages enjoyed by the defender do not arise until after the attacker has actually gained unauthorised access to the network. With a properly organised cyber defence, networks can become more resilient, continuing to function despite penetration, while frustrating attackers' attempts to exploit their intrusion.\n## Conventional war vs cyber war\nSome tactical advantages of the defence in conventional ground warfare are straightforward. The defender usually fires at the oncoming attacker from behind cover. The attacker must break cover and move towards the defender to dislodge it. Consequently, the attackers must expose themselves to deadly fire to engage the defenders, who will inflict more casualties on exposed attackers than they themselves suffer. Footnote 26 These defensive advantages yield the rule of thumb that three attackers are required to subdue one defender, a ratio some have increased to six-to-one owing to the greater lethality and accuracy of new weapons. Footnote 27\nIn conventional warfare, the defender is also typically more familiar with the terrain that the attacker must traverse and has often prepared it for defence. Footnote 28 The defender will employ natural and built obstacles to channel the attacker into areas of the battlefield where it is most vulnerable to the defender's fires. Through such preparations, the defender can seize the\ninitiative. When an attacker penetrates a well-prepared defence-in-depth, it is often following to the defender's script. In that case, the defender, not the attacker, can dictate the terms of engagement. Moreover, a stalwart defence-in-depth can produce victory by so frustrating an attacker that it breaks off the attack. During the Cold War, the US Army – a force steeped in the virtues of the offence but then insuperably outnumbered by Soviet conventional forces in Europe – rediscovered the virtues of the defensive, crystallising them in its doctrines of Active Defense and AirLand Battle. Footnote 29\nIn the cyber realm too, defenders typically have better knowledge of the terrain – the network they are defending – than attackers. Today, this awareness is increased through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to map the network's terrain and detect anomalous behaviour. Footnote 30 Employing AI in cyber defence is essential because the sheer volume and speed of attacks mean that individual cyber defenders cannot possibly detect and address each one. Footnote 31 The terrain of cyberspace, however, is different from the natural battlespace that is shaped by the defender in ground combat. Cyberspace has far greater plasticity than physical space, offering the defender more options in preparing the battlespace. Footnote 32\nGaining unauthorised access to a network is only the first step for the attacker. It must still find what it is looking for, which calls for mapping the network. This is why hackers often spend so much time inside a network before moving to exploitation. Russian hackers were inside the network of the DNC for months before they exfiltrated the batch of internal email communications that caused such a stir. Footnote 33 Once in the network, of course, the attacker is on the defender's terrain. However, a computer network is not like a terrain feature on a battlefield. It would be impossible for a conventional defender to make forests spring up where once there were plains or to render valleys smooth and bring mountains low. The defender in cyberspace, however, can do something comparable, altering the digital ground under the attacker's feet by changing the configuration of its network, thus preserving its superior situational awareness. Footnote 34 Such techniques can frustrate the attacker into breaking off its attack. Even if they don't, when the defender of a network periodically alters the configuration of the network, attackers that have managed to avoid detection and are assiduously mapping the network for exploitation will find that their data has become outdated. The harder it is to map a network, the longer the attacker must stay in the system, increasing the likelihood that it will be discovered. Furthermore, if the attacker has manipulated part of the network to hide its presence, reconfiguring the network can expose its hideout when it fails to change with the rest of the network.\nCyber defenders are already using some of these defensive tactics. For instance, the health-insurance company Aetna's cyber defenders routinely change aspects of its network so that attackers are never certain about their position within it, retaining their home-court advantage. Footnote 35 Intentional network manipulation is also getting easier by virtue of cloud-\ninfrastructure virtualisation. Devices are virtualised and typically provided as services, which means that there is nothing physical to purchase, house, wire, power or cool. A cloud provider such as Amazon maintains the virtual device, and users simply configure it to their specifications. The elements physically exposed to the internet are owned, operated and defended by the cloud provider. The flexibility this affords to shape the terrain is immense. In fact, virtualisation allows the cyber defender to change the shape of the terrain during an attack to frustrate the attacker. Footnote 36 The network that can change its configuration is a more resilient network, which is especially important for military forces that need to fend off virtual attackers while simultaneously fighting physical adversaries.\nFew companies have a cyber-defence budget the size of Aetna's, and in the past few could mount an elaborate defence. But now that the components of a network are owned, operated and defended by the likes of Amazon, economies of scale make the resources and expertise necessary to mount a formidable cyber defence-in-depth within reach of an expanding range of national governments, local governments and private companies.\nFinally, even if a cyber attack is successful, virtualisation facilitates quick recovery. It is much easier to load a pre-attack version of a virtual machine, patch its vulnerabilities and return it to service than it is to restore a physical computer to an earlier state. Virtualisation may also mean that defenders have access to a wider array of online resources to deal with distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nCyber attackers, of course, can also manipulate the virtual terrain of the network they have infiltrated. But defenders are still countering from their own territory, and their superior control and knowledge of the network means that they know the inventory and can detect changes through relatively simple means, such as white lists. Defenders can also embed responses triggered when behaviour outside of the network's established norms occurs that morphs the network and isolates the attacker. The defender still enjoys significant home-field advantages.\n# Observing the attacker\nIn ground combat, the defender can observe the approach of an attacker while remaining concealed, gathering information on capabilities and intentions. Footnote 37 The defender of a computer network can do the same. The informational advantages increase when the network defender also reconfigures the network. In facilitating the defender's search for technical signatures, these defensive advantages can also help it overcome one of the thorniest problems in cyberspace: the attacker's anonymity. With these advantages in mind, the cyber-security firm MITRE has decided that it would not make its primary objective to eject attackers from the network. Instead, it isolates and observes attackers in its system to learn about the tools they are\nusing and to waste the time of the attacker, which often has no idea that it is under observation or that it has lost the initiative.\nThe intelligence-gathering capacity of the defender increases dramatically when it exploits the malleability of the virtual landscape by establishing fake machines, known as 'honey pots', or entire fictitious networks, called 'honey nets', on its network. To draw another conventional-warfare analogy, in the Second World War, the Germans would leave the first few defensive positions that they constructed empty. Unaware of this, the attacker would deploy to breach these phantom positions. Concealed German scouts would observe this action and communicate tactical intelligence about artillery, air support and other factors to the defenders in the inhabited positions. Likewise, the cyber defender can build fake computers and networks populated with fake data to fool the attacker, and even malicious code to infect it. Footnote  $^{38}$  Moreover, because honey nets are quiet networks with very little traffic, the defender can identify any intrusion as the work of a malicious actor. At no time would the actual home network be in danger. The intruder, for its part, would remain ignorant of the fact that the stalwart defence it is confronting is not there to protect the defender's actual network. Perhaps the most important resources that the attacker wastes in breaching a honey net are exploitation tools. Once it uses one, the defender can patch against that tool in its home network, inoculating it against that exploit. In addition, honey nets can potentially contribute to cyber resilience. If the attacker diverts resources to a honey net, it is not in the real network disrupting its normal operations, reducing the degradation of the network and allowing normal operations to continue despite the presence of an intruder.\nThe extensive information obtained in defending a false network can also empower AI tools being used in a detection and defence role in the defender's real network. In order for AI to learn what to defend against, it needs data on previous attacks, and it is vital that this data be constantly updated. AI can work from the data generated from the defence of the honey net to defend the real network, detect intrusion attempts against it, and identify the intruder based on the kinds of exploitation tools it uses and other signatures. AI might even be able to predict the next move of the attacker. Footnote 39\nFinally, many, perhaps most, decisions about cyber security in both the private and public sectors are financial. If the projected losses from intrusions are lower than the cost of providing security, then governments and countries will forgo the security upgrade. For instance, prior to the 2016 election, a cyber-security consultant told the DNC that its computer network was vulnerable. Rather than spend resources on a cyber-security upgrade, the DNC decided to allocate the resources that would have required to increasing voter turnout – a decision they would come to regret. Footnote  $^{40}$  The virtualisation of computer networks has reduced the cost of building honey nets, and this service is now provided by several cyber-security firms. Footnote  $^{41}$\n# The offence–defence balance and the cyber-security dilemma\nSometimes the only way to stop a persistent attacker is to counter-attack and disrupt its ability to keep attacking. Offensive as well as defensive cyber capabilities will unavoidably be part of any major conflict. But it's important to remember that defence is not entirely inactive. As Carl von Clausewitz noted almost 200 years ago, ‘the defensive form of war is not a simple shield, but a shield made up of well-directed blows’. Footnote 42 The information that the cyber defender gathers about the attacker’s techniques and modes of operation can inform a more effective counter-attack. Such cyber counter-attacks, called response actions, are part of US doctrine for defensive cyber operations. The relevant doctrinal publication defines them as ‘external to the defended network or portion of cyberspace without the permission of the owner of the affected system … normally in foreign cyberspace’. Some response actions may involve the ‘physical damage or destruction of enemy systems’. Footnote 43 Through the use of honey pots and honey nets, for instance, the defender might introduce disguised malicious code, which the attacker unwittingly extracts and incorporates into its own network. Response actions aim to ‘kill the archer’ instead of just ‘catching arrows’. Footnote 44 They are central to the more offensive aspects of ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’.\nThe use and scale of response actions depends upon the context of the attack, and the degree of actual and potential damage inflicted. The most important consideration, however, is ‘the degree of certainty in attribution of the threat’. Footnote 45 Cyber attackers make Herculean efforts to hide their identity to reduce the likelihood of retaliation. Footnote 46 To avoid escalation and diplomatic discord, it is crucial that the counter-attacker determine that its target is the actual attacker. Here the advantages of cyber defence for counter-attack come into focus. A capable cyber defender gathers extensive information on the attacker, including its methods and intentions, which, with human and other technical intelligence, can be used to arrive at the attacker’s identity. The longer the cyber defender observes the attacker, the better the overall intelligence package. In cyberspace, the best offence may emerge from a stalwart defence.\nAI and quantum computing are sometimes seen as shifting the balance in cyber warfare decisively to the offence. This seems far from certain. AI is likely be as effective on defence as it is on offence. AI is being used, for example, to develop intrusion-detection systems that ‘outperform other techniques because of their flexibility, adaptability, rapid calculations, and quick learning’. Footnote 47 While quantum computing will make it harder for defenders to encrypt their networks, cyber-security experts have begun designing essentially quantum-proof encryption. Footnote 48\nBen Buchanan argues that there is a security dilemma in the cyber domain that will drive states to engage in offensive cyber operations. The logic is that states must offensively penetrate their\npotential adversaries' networks to discover what offensive capabilities they possess; they, in turn, could interpret these intrusions as precursors to an attack or the attack itself, eliciting a cyber counter-attack and potentially triggering an escalatory spiral. Footnote  $^{49}$  Yet full consideration of the advantages of the cyber defence can dampen this logic. One key reason nation-states might engage in offensive cyber intrusions is that they think that their identity will remain hidden. But a defender who mobilises the advantages of cyber defence can use the information it gains to identify the potential attacker. Beyond that, the defender can use the information about the attacker's capabilities to launch a precisely targeted counter-attack. This capability constitutes a substantial deterrent.\nAgain, offensive capabilities are a necessary part of cyber national security, and penetrating networks will prove essential in any conflict spanning multiple domains. But defenders do not always need to attack opposing networks to develop and hone their offensive cyber capabilities. This can be done through red-teaming, which has become a common practice in network defence in cyberspace. Companies like MITRE and FireEye develop offensive cyber tools to stress-test the networks of their customers. Structurally, as cyber defence becomes stronger, offensive intrusions will require more and more resources, decreasing their efficiency over time. Money and time – the latter being a resource we can never recover – will be better spent on cyber defence. Without doubt, incentives will remain to engage in intrusions, albeit in the name of defence, but undertaking them will become increasingly risky and inefficient, and the incentives for doing so correspondingly diminished. Accordingly, the intensity of the cybersecurity dilemma is likely to decrease.\n\\*\nWe have painted a rather optimistic picture of the future of cyber defence, and we acknowledge that it is hardly guaranteed. As in conventional war, the offence-defence balance is not static. For now, however, advances in cyber-security technology have made it easier to harness the advantages of cyber defence. The balance has shifted towards the defender and is likely to shift still further in its favour. Policymakers therefore should not assume that offensive cyber operations are the most effective tools for assurance and de-escalation. Footnote  $^{50}$  A key objective of a strategy is to convince adversaries that their own strategies cannot succeed.

This makes the job of the attacker much more difficult. 'For the nation-state offense', Aitel said, 'you put such a premium on not getting caught that you really don't have a huge advantage'. Footnote 19 In some ways this is unsurprising. Cyber security is one of the top ten fastest-growing fields, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with a projected growth rate of 35% over the next ten years, much higher than the projected growth rate of jobs in other fields. Footnote 20 The more resources that the government and private sector invest in cyber security, the more difficult it becomes for attackers to find soft targets. Footnote 21 The advantages of cyber defence over offence were among the findings of the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission in 2020. Footnote 22\nWhile technological shifts affect the balance between attack and defence in conventional warfare, the built-in advantages of the defence eventually tend to reassert themselves. New technologies can initially favour the attacker, but when these technologies diffuse to the defender, and the defender combines them with its inherent advantages, the attacker's initial edge often slips away. In 1940, when the German army crushed France's in six weeks, it appeared that German panzers, which seemed unstoppable, had decisively shifted the balance to the attacker's advantage.\nHowever, when the defender armed itself with the same weapons and adjusted its tactics, the balance shifted back to the defence. Later in the war, the Germans themselves demonstrated how technology had empowered the defence. In resisting the Allied advance after D-Day, the Germans used their panzers to strengthen defence-in-depth and inflicted major losses on the Allied attackers. In July 1944, for instance, during Operation Goodwood, the Germans destroyed more than a third of the British tanks brought onto the continent after the Normandy landings. Footnote 23 The difficulties Ukraine encountered in its recent counter-offensive reflected the effectiveness of Russia's prepared defence. Footnote 24 A similar arc is playing out in cyberspace.\nDespite the general recognition that defence is the stronger form of cyber warfare, investment in defensive capabilities and techniques has lagged because of the costs of implementation. That too is now changing. Defence is getting cheaper and stronger, driving up the costs of engaging in offence and strengthening deterrence. Not only are advances in network technology and security making cyber defence even stronger, but these innovations are also reducing the cost of deploying resilient cyber defence-in-depth, which some network defenders are already deploying. Some have argued that, given unlimited time and resources, the cyber attacker will always get through, affording the offence a long-term advantage. Footnote 25 But the mere fact that an attacker can gain access to a defender's computer network does not mean it will defeat the defender. The fight does not stop at the network's border. Indeed, given the speed and frequency of cyber attacks, preventing every network penetration and exploitation is impossible, and resilience is key to functionality. But many of the advantages enjoyed by the defender do not arise until after the attacker has actually gained unauthorised access to the network. With a properly organised cyber defence, networks can become more resilient, continuing to function despite penetration, while frustrating attackers' attempts to exploit their intrusion.\n## Conventional war vs cyber war\nSome tactical advantages of the defence in conventional ground warfare are straightforward. The defender usually fires at the oncoming attacker from behind cover. The attacker must break cover and move towards the defender to dislodge it. Consequently, the attackers must expose themselves to deadly fire to engage the defenders, who will inflict more casualties on exposed attackers than they themselves suffer. Footnote 26 These defensive advantages yield the rule of thumb that three attackers are required to subdue one defender, a ratio some have increased to six-to-one owing to the greater lethality and accuracy of new weapons. Footnote 27\nIn conventional warfare, the defender is also typically more familiar with the terrain that the attacker must traverse and has often prepared it for defence. Footnote 28 The defender will employ natural and built obstacles to channel the attacker into areas of the battlefield where it is most vulnerable to the defender's fires. Through such preparations, the defender can seize the\ninitiative. When an attacker penetrates a well-prepared defence-in-depth, it is often following to the defender's script. In that case, the defender, not the attacker, can dictate the terms of engagement. Moreover, a stalwart defence-in-depth can produce victory by so frustrating an attacker that it breaks off the attack. During the Cold War, the US Army – a force steeped in the virtues of the offence but then insuperably outnumbered by Soviet conventional forces in Europe – rediscovered the virtues of the defensive, crystallising them in its doctrines of Active Defense and AirLand Battle. Footnote 29\nIn the cyber realm too, defenders typically have better knowledge of the terrain – the network they are defending – than attackers. Today, this awareness is increased through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to map the network's terrain and detect anomalous behaviour. Footnote 30 Employing AI in cyber defence is essential because the sheer volume and speed of attacks mean that individual cyber defenders cannot possibly detect and address each one. Footnote 31 The terrain of cyberspace, however, is different from the natural battlespace that is shaped by the defender in ground combat. Cyberspace has far greater plasticity than physical space, offering the defender more options in preparing the battlespace. Footnote 32\nGaining unauthorised access to a network is only the first step for the attacker. It must still find what it is looking for, which calls for mapping the network. This is why hackers often spend so much time inside a network before moving to exploitation. Russian hackers were inside the network of the DNC for months before they exfiltrated the batch of internal email communications that caused such a stir. Footnote 33 Once in the network, of course, the attacker is on the defender's terrain. However, a computer network is not like a terrain feature on a battlefield. It would be impossible for a conventional defender to make forests spring up where once there were plains or to render valleys smooth and bring mountains low. The defender in cyberspace, however, can do something comparable, altering the digital ground under the attacker's feet by changing the configuration of its network, thus preserving its superior situational awareness. Footnote 34 Such techniques can frustrate the attacker into breaking off its attack. Even if they don't, when the defender of a network periodically alters the configuration of the network, attackers that have managed to avoid detection and are assiduously mapping the network for exploitation will find that their data has become outdated. The harder it is to map a network, the longer the attacker must stay in the system, increasing the likelihood that it will be discovered. Furthermore, if the attacker has manipulated part of the network to hide its presence, reconfiguring the network can expose its hideout when it fails to change with the rest of the network.\nCyber defenders are already using some of these defensive tactics. For instance, the health-insurance company Aetna's cyber defenders routinely change aspects of its network so that attackers are never certain about their position within it, retaining their home-court advantage. Footnote 35 Intentional network manipulation is also getting easier by virtue of cloud-\ninfrastructure virtualisation. Devices are virtualised and typically provided as services, which means that there is nothing physical to purchase, house, wire, power or cool. A cloud provider such as Amazon maintains the virtual device, and users simply configure it to their specifications. The elements physically exposed to the internet are owned, operated and defended by the cloud provider. The flexibility this affords to shape the terrain is immense. In fact, virtualisation allows the cyber defender to change the shape of the terrain during an attack to frustrate the attacker. Footnote 36 The network that can change its configuration is a more resilient network, which is especially important for military forces that need to fend off virtual attackers while simultaneously fighting physical adversaries.\nFew companies have a cyber-defence budget the size of Aetna's, and in the past few could mount an elaborate defence. But now that the components of a network are owned, operated and defended by the likes of Amazon, economies of scale make the resources and expertise necessary to mount a formidable cyber defence-in-depth within reach of an expanding range of national governments, local governments and private companies.\nFinally, even if a cyber attack is successful, virtualisation facilitates quick recovery. It is much easier to load a pre-attack version of a virtual machine, patch its vulnerabilities and return it to service than it is to restore a physical computer to an earlier state. Virtualisation may also mean that defenders have access to a wider array of online resources to deal with distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nCyber attackers, of course, can also manipulate the virtual terrain of the network they have infiltrated. But defenders are still countering from their own territory, and their superior control and knowledge of the network means that they know the inventory and can detect changes through relatively simple means, such as white lists. Defenders can also embed responses triggered when behaviour outside of the network's established norms occurs that morphs the network and isolates the attacker. The defender still enjoys significant home-field advantages.\n# Observing the attacker\nIn ground combat, the defender can observe the approach of an attacker while remaining concealed, gathering information on capabilities and intentions. Footnote 37 The defender of a computer network can do the same. The informational advantages increase when the network defender also reconfigures the network. In facilitating the defender's search for technical signatures, these defensive advantages can also help it overcome one of the thorniest problems in cyberspace: the attacker's anonymity. With these advantages in mind, the cyber-security firm MITRE has decided that it would not make its primary objective to eject attackers from the network. Instead, it isolates and observes attackers in its system to learn about the tools they are\nusing and to waste the time of the attacker, which often has no idea that it is under observation or that it has lost the initiative.\nThe intelligence-gathering capacity of the defender increases dramatically when it exploits the malleability of the virtual landscape by establishing fake machines, known as 'honey pots', or entire fictitious networks, called 'honey nets', on its network. To draw another conventional-warfare analogy, in the Second World War, the Germans would leave the first few defensive positions that they constructed empty. Unaware of this, the attacker would deploy to breach these phantom positions. Concealed German scouts would observe this action and communicate tactical intelligence about artillery, air support and other factors to the defenders in the inhabited positions. Likewise, the cyber defender can build fake computers and networks populated with fake data to fool the attacker, and even malicious code to infect it. Footnote  $^{38}$  Moreover, because honey nets are quiet networks with very little traffic, the defender can identify any intrusion as the work of a malicious actor. At no time would the actual home network be in danger. The intruder, for its part, would remain ignorant of the fact that the stalwart defence it is confronting is not there to protect the defender's actual network. Perhaps the most important resources that the attacker wastes in breaching a honey net are exploitation tools. Once it uses one, the defender can patch against that tool in its home network, inoculating it against that exploit. In addition, honey nets can potentially contribute to cyber resilience. If the attacker diverts resources to a honey net, it is not in the real network disrupting its normal operations, reducing the degradation of the network and allowing normal operations to continue despite the presence of an intruder.\nThe extensive information obtained in defending a false network can also empower AI tools being used in a detection and defence role in the defender's real network. In order for AI to learn what to defend against, it needs data on previous attacks, and it is vital that this data be constantly updated. AI can work from the data generated from the defence of the honey net to defend the real network, detect intrusion attempts against it, and identify the intruder based on the kinds of exploitation tools it uses and other signatures. AI might even be able to predict the next move of the attacker. Footnote 39\nFinally, many, perhaps most, decisions about cyber security in both the private and public sectors are financial. If the projected losses from intrusions are lower than the cost of providing security, then governments and countries will forgo the security upgrade. For instance, prior to the 2016 election, a cyber-security consultant told the DNC that its computer network was vulnerable. Rather than spend resources on a cyber-security upgrade, the DNC decided to allocate the resources that would have required to increasing voter turnout – a decision they would come to regret. Footnote  $^{40}$  The virtualisation of computer networks has reduced the cost of building honey nets, and this service is now provided by several cyber-security firms. Footnote  $^{41}$\n# The offence–defence balance and the cyber-security dilemma\nSometimes the only way to stop a persistent attacker is to counter-attack and disrupt its ability to keep attacking. Offensive as well as defensive cyber capabilities will unavoidably be part of any major conflict. But it's important to remember that defence is not entirely inactive. As Carl von Clausewitz noted almost 200 years ago, ‘the defensive form of war is not a simple shield, but a shield made up of well-directed blows’. Footnote 42 The information that the cyber defender gathers about the attacker’s techniques and modes of operation can inform a more effective counter-attack. Such cyber counter-attacks, called response actions, are part of US doctrine for defensive cyber operations. The relevant doctrinal publication defines them as ‘external to the defended network or portion of cyberspace without the permission of the owner of the affected system … normally in foreign cyberspace’. Some response actions may involve the ‘physical damage or destruction of enemy systems’. Footnote 43 Through the use of honey pots and honey nets, for instance, the defender might introduce disguised malicious code, which the attacker unwittingly extracts and incorporates into its own network. Response actions aim to ‘kill the archer’ instead of just ‘catching arrows’. Footnote 44 They are central to the more offensive aspects of ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’.\nThe use and scale of response actions depends upon the context of the attack, and the degree of actual and potential damage inflicted. The most important consideration, however, is ‘the degree of certainty in attribution of the threat’. Footnote 45 Cyber attackers make Herculean efforts to hide their identity to reduce the likelihood of retaliation. Footnote 46 To avoid escalation and diplomatic discord, it is crucial that the counter-attacker determine that its target is the actual attacker. Here the advantages of cyber defence for counter-attack come into focus. A capable cyber defender gathers extensive information on the attacker, including its methods and intentions, which, with human and other technical intelligence, can be used to arrive at the attacker’s identity. The longer the cyber defender observes the attacker, the better the overall intelligence package. In cyberspace, the best offence may emerge from a stalwart defence.\nAI and quantum computing are sometimes seen as shifting the balance in cyber warfare decisively to the offence. This seems far from certain. AI is likely be as effective on defence as it is on offence. AI is being used, for example, to develop intrusion-detection systems that ‘outperform other techniques because of their flexibility, adaptability, rapid calculations, and quick learning’. Footnote 47 While quantum computing will make it harder for defenders to encrypt their networks, cyber-security experts have begun designing essentially quantum-proof encryption. Footnote 48\nBen Buchanan argues that there is a security dilemma in the cyber domain that will drive states to engage in offensive cyber operations. The logic is that states must offensively penetrate their\npotential adversaries' networks to discover what offensive capabilities they possess; they, in turn, could interpret these intrusions as precursors to an attack or the attack itself, eliciting a cyber counter-attack and potentially triggering an escalatory spiral. Footnote  $^{49}$  Yet full consideration of the advantages of the cyber defence can dampen this logic. One key reason nation-states might engage in offensive cyber intrusions is that they think that their identity will remain hidden. But a defender who mobilises the advantages of cyber defence can use the information it gains to identify the potential attacker. Beyond that, the defender can use the information about the attacker's capabilities to launch a precisely targeted counter-attack. This capability constitutes a substantial deterrent.\nAgain, offensive capabilities are a necessary part of cyber national security, and penetrating networks will prove essential in any conflict spanning multiple domains. But defenders do not always need to attack opposing networks to develop and hone their offensive cyber capabilities. This can be done through red-teaming, which has become a common practice in network defence in cyberspace. Companies like MITRE and FireEye develop offensive cyber tools to stress-test the networks of their customers. Structurally, as cyber defence becomes stronger, offensive intrusions will require more and more resources, decreasing their efficiency over time. Money and time – the latter being a resource we can never recover – will be better spent on cyber defence. Without doubt, incentives will remain to engage in intrusions, albeit in the name of defence, but undertaking them will become increasingly risky and inefficient, and the incentives for doing so correspondingly diminished. Accordingly, the intensity of the cybersecurity dilemma is likely to decrease.\n\\*\nWe have painted a rather optimistic picture of the future of cyber defence, and we acknowledge that it is hardly guaranteed. As in conventional war, the offence-defence balance is not static. For now, however, advances in cyber-security technology have made it easier to harness the advantages of cyber defence. The balance has shifted towards the defender and is likely to shift still further in its favour. Policymakers therefore should not assume that offensive cyber operations are the most effective tools for assurance and de-escalation. Footnote  $^{50}$  A key objective of a strategy is to convince adversaries that their own strategies cannot succeed. Footnote  $^{51}$  Advertising and mobilising the advantages of the cyber defence could affect their perceptions, helping to convince them that the offensive game is not worth the candle.\nFurthermore, as Clausewitz argued, there are advantages to being on the defensive at the strategic as well as the tactical level. It is plausible that the tactical advantages of cyber defence could be scaled up to protect a strategic network of networks. There has been much hand-wringing about the havoc that minor-power adversaries such as Iran and North Korea could wreak in cyberspace. But minor-power US allies can also punch above their weight in cyberspace, and they have a vested interest in securing it. Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine have intriguingly proposed a\nvirtual alliance among technologically advanced democracies. Footnote 52 Properly organised and coordinated, they could collectively employ the tactical advantages of cyber defence to establish a formidable network of networks, prioritising defensive measures, sharing information gathered on attackers and strengthening cyber security across the board. This would be a powerful means of consolidating the defenders' advantages and deterring those who would seek to achieve cyber security through cyber attack.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Peter Wostenberg, a PhD candidate in Baylor University's Department of Political Science, for his assistance with research and revisions."

It is estimated that cyber crime will cost the global economy $10.5 trillion by 2025 – more than twice the GDP of Japan or Germany, the third- and fourth-largest economies in the world. Footnote 1 However, criminals are not the only ones profiting from the use of tools like ransomware and malware. States are building illicit revenue streams through the internet. North Korea has employed cyber attacks to steal $2 billion from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges to fund its weapons programmes. Footnote 2 In July 2021, NATO accused China of engaging in extensive cyber intrusions, most notably of the Microsoft Exchange Server. Footnote 3 Russia penetrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 in order to influence the US presidential election. More recently, Russian hackers broke into the information-technology firm SolarWinds, through which they gained access to the sensitive data of multiple US government agencies and departments. Footnote 4 It's nothing new. Footnote 5 The success of these intrusions has led many to denigrate remaining on the defensive\nin cyber and advocate unleashing offensive cyber operations. The executive and legislative branches of the US government have promoted a more aggressive approach to threats emanating from cyberspace. The Trump administration emphasised ‘defending forward’. The McCain Act gave the US military the power to penetrate foreign adversaries’ networks as a normal part of ensuring national security. Footnote 6 The second pillar of the Biden administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy is to ‘disrupt and dismantle threat actors’ in cyberspace using ‘all the instruments of national power’. Footnote 7\nWhile the language employed has been defensive in tone, it often entails offensive action. For instance, US Cyber Command characterises ‘defend forward’ as follows: ‘if a device, a network, an organization, or adversary nation is identified as a threat to US networks and institutions, or is actively attacking them in or through cyberspace – it can expect the United States to impose costs in response.’ Stating that costs will be imposed not only on those actively attacking ‘US networks and institutions’ but also those considered ‘a threat to US networks and institutions’ implies that defend forward is not passive, but has offensive elements. The same goes for ‘persistent engagement’, which Cyber Command argues shifts its ‘posture in cyberspace from reactive to proactive’ and includes efforts to ‘degrade the capabilities and networks of adversaries’. Footnote 8\nWe define an action in cyberspace as offensive if it involves gaining unauthorised access to a computer network and then using that access to extract information, cause destruction or plant malicious code. This includes cyber espionage and intelligence operations. Under this definition, ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’ are offensive. These actions may have defensive purposes, such as uncovering the offensive capabilities of an adversary to protect one’s own networks. But they are not defensive in the sense of merely seeking to strengthen a network against intrusions and responding to intrusions only when they occur.\nBefore shifting resources into offensive cyber operations, it would be prudent to consider, and to the extent possible harness, the advantages of being on the defensive. Defensive modes of warfare tend to attract less scholarly interest than their offensive counterparts. Footnote 9 Our aim is to provide a more balanced assessment of the power of defensive measures, which can help moderate calls for a highly aggressive approach to cyber security. We argue that, properly assessed, cyber defence is strong and getting stronger. We tilt towards scholars such as Thomas Rid and Erik Gartzke, who have sought to reduce alarmism about cyber capabilities among policymakers and the public.

    "# Abstract\n\nApprehension about cyber insecurity can be reduced by taking into account the growing power of defence in cyberspace. The cyber defender is strong and getting stronger. Several of the advantages that the defender in ground combat enjoys, such as superior knowledge of and preparation of the terrain, apply to the defence of computer networks. In fact, the plasticity of virtual terrain magnifies these defensive advantages. Cyber defenders are increasingly harnessing this power, improving cyber security and resilience without resort to cyber offence. The advances in cyber technology that empower the defender are becoming more widely available and affordable. In addition, the power of cyber defence and the challenges it presents to cyber offence can reduce the intensity of the cyber-security dilemma.\n\n## Key words:\n\n- Cyber attack\n- cyber defence\n- cyber offence\n- cyber security\n- defend forward\n- honey nets\n- offence-defence balance\n- persistent engagement\n- security dilemma\n- virtualisation\n\n## Previous article\n\nView issue table of contents\n\n## Next article\n\nThe costs of malign behaviour on the internet are enormous. It is estimated that cyber crime will cost the global economy $10.5 trillion by 2025 – more than twice the GDP of Japan or Germany, the third- and fourth-largest economies in the world. Footnote 1 However, criminals are not the only ones profiting from the use of tools like ransomware and malware. States are building illicit revenue streams through the internet. North Korea has employed cyber attacks to steal $2 billion from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges to fund its weapons programmes. Footnote 2 In July 2021, NATO accused China of engaging in extensive cyber intrusions, most notably of the Microsoft Exchange Server. Footnote 3 Russia penetrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 in order to influence the US presidential election. More recently, Russian hackers broke into the information-technology firm SolarWinds, through which they gained access to the sensitive data of multiple US government agencies and departments. Footnote 4 It's nothing new. Footnote 5 The success of these intrusions has led many to denigrate remaining on the defensive",
    "in cyber and advocate unleashing offensive cyber operations. The executive and legislative branches of the US government have promoted a more aggressive approach to threats emanating from cyberspace. The Trump administration emphasised ‘defending forward’. The McCain Act gave the US military the power to penetrate foreign adversaries’ networks as a normal part of ensuring national security. Footnote 6 The second pillar of the Biden administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy is to ‘disrupt and dismantle threat actors’ in cyberspace using ‘all the instruments of national power’. Footnote 7\n\nWhile the language employed has been defensive in tone, it often entails offensive action. For instance, US Cyber Command characterises ‘defend forward’ as follows: ‘if a device, a network, an organization, or adversary nation is identified as a threat to US networks and institutions, or is actively attacking them in or through cyberspace – it can expect the United States to impose costs in response.’ Stating that costs will be imposed not only on those actively attacking ‘US networks and institutions’ but also those considered ‘a threat to US networks and institutions’ implies that defend forward is not passive, but has offensive elements. The same goes for ‘persistent engagement’, which Cyber Command argues shifts its ‘posture in cyberspace from reactive to proactive’ and includes efforts to ‘degrade the capabilities and networks of adversaries’. Footnote 8\n\nWe define an action in cyberspace as offensive if it involves gaining unauthorised access to a computer network and then using that access to extract information, cause destruction or plant malicious code. This includes cyber espionage and intelligence operations. Under this definition, ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’ are offensive. These actions may have defensive purposes, such as uncovering the offensive capabilities of an adversary to protect one’s own networks. But they are not defensive in the sense of merely seeking to strengthen a network against intrusions and responding to intrusions only when they occur.\n\nBefore shifting resources into offensive cyber operations, it would be prudent to consider, and to the extent possible harness, the advantages of being on the defensive. Defensive modes of warfare tend to attract less scholarly interest than their offensive counterparts. Footnote 9 Our aim is to provide a more balanced assessment of the power of defensive measures, which can help moderate calls for a highly aggressive approach to cyber security. We argue that, properly assessed, cyber defence is strong and getting stronger. We tilt towards scholars such as Thomas Rid and Erik Gartzke, who have sought to reduce alarmism about cyber capabilities among policymakers and the public. Footnote 10\n\n## The growing power of the defence\n\nThe offence-defence literature assesses whether it is easier to attack or to defend in war, how technology and geography alter the balance between the offence and the defence, and the effects",
    "of this balance on international relations, especially as a cause of war. An offence-dominant world is more war-prone because even non-aggressive actors are tempted to strike first. Footnote 11 A number of scholars have tried to assess the strengths, weaknesses and implications of the balance between offence and defence in cyberspace. Footnote 12 Ben Buchanan argues that the nature of cyber capabilities produces a cybersecurity dilemma that explains the calls to unleash the cyber offence to secure the state. He notes that even states without hostile intentions must engage in offensive network penetrations to ready their cyber defences against an adversary's hidden offensive capabilities. Footnote 13 Others have argued that the relative weakness and impermanence of cyber attacks mean that offensive actions in cyber can actually ease security dilemmas. For example, resorting only to cyber attacks in response to a crisis could forestall crisis escalation and produce reassurance by signalling a country's intention not to extend warfare beyond cyberspace. Footnote 14\n\nOf course, the offence-defence balance can be misperceived, with disastrous consequences. Just prior to the First World War, the great powers had considerable faith in the superiority of the offence, which helped precipitate war. Footnote 15 Policymakers are now underrating the advantages of the defence, this time in cyber. According to Richard Clarke and Robert Knake, in the early days of the internet, the attacker had a distinct advantage because the internet's defences were so porous. Footnote 16 As recently as a decade ago, according to a former US National Security Agency (NSA) cryptanalyst, cyber attackers could infiltrate industrial-control systems relatively easily. Footnote 17 Today, however, the balance has begun to shift towards the defender. Footnote 18 Dave Aitel, a veteran hacker who worked for the NSA and then private cybersecurity firms, told Clarke and Knake that intrusion-detection capabilities 'actually work', which is 'a huge change'. This makes the job of the attacker much more difficult. 'For the nation-state offense', Aitel said, 'you put such a premium on not getting caught that you really don't have a huge advantage'. Footnote 19 In some ways this is unsurprising. Cyber security is one of the top ten fastest-growing fields, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with a projected growth rate of 35% over the next ten years, much higher than the projected growth rate of jobs in other fields. Footnote 20 The more resources that the government and private sector invest in cyber security, the more difficult it becomes for attackers to find soft targets. Footnote 21 The advantages of cyber defence over offence were among the findings of the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission in 2020. Footnote 22\n\nWhile technological shifts affect the balance between attack and defence in conventional warfare, the built-in advantages of the defence eventually tend to reassert themselves. New technologies can initially favour the attacker, but when these technologies diffuse to the defender, and the defender combines them with its inherent advantages, the attacker's initial edge often slips away. In 1940, when the German army crushed France's in six weeks, it appeared that German panzers, which seemed unstoppable, had decisively shifted the balance to the attacker's advantage.",
    "However, when the defender armed itself with the same weapons and adjusted its tactics, the balance shifted back to the defence. Later in the war, the Germans themselves demonstrated how technology had empowered the defence. In resisting the Allied advance after D-Day, the Germans used their panzers to strengthen defence-in-depth and inflicted major losses on the Allied attackers. In July 1944, for instance, during Operation Goodwood, the Germans destroyed more than a third of the British tanks brought onto the continent after the Normandy landings. Footnote 23 The difficulties Ukraine encountered in its recent counter-offensive reflected the effectiveness of Russia's prepared defence. Footnote 24 A similar arc is playing out in cyberspace.\n\nDespite the general recognition that defence is the stronger form of cyber warfare, investment in defensive capabilities and techniques has lagged because of the costs of implementation. That too is now changing. Defence is getting cheaper and stronger, driving up the costs of engaging in offence and strengthening deterrence. Not only are advances in network technology and security making cyber defence even stronger, but these innovations are also reducing the cost of deploying resilient cyber defence-in-depth, which some network defenders are already deploying. Some have argued that, given unlimited time and resources, the cyber attacker will always get through, affording the offence a long-term advantage. Footnote 25 But the mere fact that an attacker can gain access to a defender's computer network does not mean it will defeat the defender. The fight does not stop at the network's border. Indeed, given the speed and frequency of cyber attacks, preventing every network penetration and exploitation is impossible, and resilience is key to functionality. But many of the advantages enjoyed by the defender do not arise until after the attacker has actually gained unauthorised access to the network. With a properly organised cyber defence, networks can become more resilient, continuing to function despite penetration, while frustrating attackers' attempts to exploit their intrusion.\n\n## Conventional war vs cyber war\n\nSome tactical advantages of the defence in conventional ground warfare are straightforward. The defender usually fires at the oncoming attacker from behind cover. The attacker must break cover and move towards the defender to dislodge it. Consequently, the attackers must expose themselves to deadly fire to engage the defenders, who will inflict more casualties on exposed attackers than they themselves suffer. Footnote 26 These defensive advantages yield the rule of thumb that three attackers are required to subdue one defender, a ratio some have increased to six-to-one owing to the greater lethality and accuracy of new weapons. Footnote 27\n\nIn conventional warfare, the defender is also typically more familiar with the terrain that the attacker must traverse and has often prepared it for defence. Footnote 28 The defender will employ natural and built obstacles to channel the attacker into areas of the battlefield where it is most vulnerable to the defender's fires. Through such preparations, the defender can seize the",
    "initiative. When an attacker penetrates a well-prepared defence-in-depth, it is often following to the defender's script. In that case, the defender, not the attacker, can dictate the terms of engagement. Moreover, a stalwart defence-in-depth can produce victory by so frustrating an attacker that it breaks off the attack. During the Cold War, the US Army – a force steeped in the virtues of the offence but then insuperably outnumbered by Soviet conventional forces in Europe – rediscovered the virtues of the defensive, crystallising them in its doctrines of Active Defense and AirLand Battle. Footnote 29\n\nIn the cyber realm too, defenders typically have better knowledge of the terrain – the network they are defending – than attackers. Today, this awareness is increased through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to map the network's terrain and detect anomalous behaviour. Footnote 30 Employing AI in cyber defence is essential because the sheer volume and speed of attacks mean that individual cyber defenders cannot possibly detect and address each one. Footnote 31 The terrain of cyberspace, however, is different from the natural battlespace that is shaped by the defender in ground combat. Cyberspace has far greater plasticity than physical space, offering the defender more options in preparing the battlespace. Footnote 32\n\nGaining unauthorised access to a network is only the first step for the attacker. It must still find what it is looking for, which calls for mapping the network. This is why hackers often spend so much time inside a network before moving to exploitation. Russian hackers were inside the network of the DNC for months before they exfiltrated the batch of internal email communications that caused such a stir. Footnote 33 Once in the network, of course, the attacker is on the defender's terrain. However, a computer network is not like a terrain feature on a battlefield. It would be impossible for a conventional defender to make forests spring up where once there were plains or to render valleys smooth and bring mountains low. The defender in cyberspace, however, can do something comparable, altering the digital ground under the attacker's feet by changing the configuration of its network, thus preserving its superior situational awareness. Footnote 34 Such techniques can frustrate the attacker into breaking off its attack. Even if they don't, when the defender of a network periodically alters the configuration of the network, attackers that have managed to avoid detection and are assiduously mapping the network for exploitation will find that their data has become outdated. The harder it is to map a network, the longer the attacker must stay in the system, increasing the likelihood that it will be discovered. Furthermore, if the attacker has manipulated part of the network to hide its presence, reconfiguring the network can expose its hideout when it fails to change with the rest of the network.\n\nCyber defenders are already using some of these defensive tactics. For instance, the health-insurance company Aetna's cyber defenders routinely change aspects of its network so that attackers are never certain about their position within it, retaining their home-court advantage. Footnote 35 Intentional network manipulation is also getting easier by virtue of cloud-",
    "infrastructure virtualisation. Devices are virtualised and typically provided as services, which means that there is nothing physical to purchase, house, wire, power or cool. A cloud provider such as Amazon maintains the virtual device, and users simply configure it to their specifications. The elements physically exposed to the internet are owned, operated and defended by the cloud provider. The flexibility this affords to shape the terrain is immense. In fact, virtualisation allows the cyber defender to change the shape of the terrain during an attack to frustrate the attacker. Footnote 36 The network that can change its configuration is a more resilient network, which is especially important for military forces that need to fend off virtual attackers while simultaneously fighting physical adversaries.\n\nFew companies have a cyber-defence budget the size of Aetna's, and in the past few could mount an elaborate defence. But now that the components of a network are owned, operated and defended by the likes of Amazon, economies of scale make the resources and expertise necessary to mount a formidable cyber defence-in-depth within reach of an expanding range of national governments, local governments and private companies.\n\nFinally, even if a cyber attack is successful, virtualisation facilitates quick recovery. It is much easier to load a pre-attack version of a virtual machine, patch its vulnerabilities and return it to service than it is to restore a physical computer to an earlier state. Virtualisation may also mean that defenders have access to a wider array of online resources to deal with distributed denial-of-service attacks.\n\nCyber attackers, of course, can also manipulate the virtual terrain of the network they have infiltrated. But defenders are still countering from their own territory, and their superior control and knowledge of the network means that they know the inventory and can detect changes through relatively simple means, such as white lists. Defenders can also embed responses triggered when behaviour outside of the network's established norms occurs that morphs the network and isolates the attacker. The defender still enjoys significant home-field advantages.\n\n# Observing the attacker\n\nIn ground combat, the defender can observe the approach of an attacker while remaining concealed, gathering information on capabilities and intentions. Footnote 37 The defender of a computer network can do the same. The informational advantages increase when the network defender also reconfigures the network. In facilitating the defender's search for technical signatures, these defensive advantages can also help it overcome one of the thorniest problems in cyberspace: the attacker's anonymity. With these advantages in mind, the cyber-security firm MITRE has decided that it would not make its primary objective to eject attackers from the network. Instead, it isolates and observes attackers in its system to learn about the tools they are",
    "using and to waste the time of the attacker, which often has no idea that it is under observation or that it has lost the initiative.\n\nThe intelligence-gathering capacity of the defender increases dramatically when it exploits the malleability of the virtual landscape by establishing fake machines, known as 'honey pots', or entire fictitious networks, called 'honey nets', on its network. To draw another conventional-warfare analogy, in the Second World War, the Germans would leave the first few defensive positions that they constructed empty. Unaware of this, the attacker would deploy to breach these phantom positions. Concealed German scouts would observe this action and communicate tactical intelligence about artillery, air support and other factors to the defenders in the inhabited positions. Likewise, the cyber defender can build fake computers and networks populated with fake data to fool the attacker, and even malicious code to infect it. Footnote  $^{38}$  Moreover, because honey nets are quiet networks with very little traffic, the defender can identify any intrusion as the work of a malicious actor. At no time would the actual home network be in danger. The intruder, for its part, would remain ignorant of the fact that the stalwart defence it is confronting is not there to protect the defender's actual network. Perhaps the most important resources that the attacker wastes in breaching a honey net are exploitation tools. Once it uses one, the defender can patch against that tool in its home network, inoculating it against that exploit. In addition, honey nets can potentially contribute to cyber resilience. If the attacker diverts resources to a honey net, it is not in the real network disrupting its normal operations, reducing the degradation of the network and allowing normal operations to continue despite the presence of an intruder.\n\nThe extensive information obtained in defending a false network can also empower AI tools being used in a detection and defence role in the defender's real network. In order for AI to learn what to defend against, it needs data on previous attacks, and it is vital that this data be constantly updated. AI can work from the data generated from the defence of the honey net to defend the real network, detect intrusion attempts against it, and identify the intruder based on the kinds of exploitation tools it uses and other signatures. AI might even be able to predict the next move of the attacker. Footnote 39\n\nFinally, many, perhaps most, decisions about cyber security in both the private and public sectors are financial. If the projected losses from intrusions are lower than the cost of providing security, then governments and countries will forgo the security upgrade. For instance, prior to the 2016 election, a cyber-security consultant told the DNC that its computer network was vulnerable. Rather than spend resources on a cyber-security upgrade, the DNC decided to allocate the resources that would have required to increasing voter turnout – a decision they would come to regret. Footnote  $^{40}$  The virtualisation of computer networks has reduced the cost of building honey nets, and this service is now provided by several cyber-security firms. Footnote  $^{41}$",
    "# The offence–defence balance and the cyber-security dilemma\n\nSometimes the only way to stop a persistent attacker is to counter-attack and disrupt its ability to keep attacking. Offensive as well as defensive cyber capabilities will unavoidably be part of any major conflict. But it's important to remember that defence is not entirely inactive. As Carl von Clausewitz noted almost 200 years ago, ‘the defensive form of war is not a simple shield, but a shield made up of well-directed blows’. Footnote 42 The information that the cyber defender gathers about the attacker’s techniques and modes of operation can inform a more effective counter-attack. Such cyber counter-attacks, called response actions, are part of US doctrine for defensive cyber operations. The relevant doctrinal publication defines them as ‘external to the defended network or portion of cyberspace without the permission of the owner of the affected system … normally in foreign cyberspace’. Some response actions may involve the ‘physical damage or destruction of enemy systems’. Footnote 43 Through the use of honey pots and honey nets, for instance, the defender might introduce disguised malicious code, which the attacker unwittingly extracts and incorporates into its own network. Response actions aim to ‘kill the archer’ instead of just ‘catching arrows’. Footnote 44 They are central to the more offensive aspects of ‘defend forward’ and ‘persistent engagement’.\n\nThe use and scale of response actions depends upon the context of the attack, and the degree of actual and potential damage inflicted. The most important consideration, however, is ‘the degree of certainty in attribution of the threat’. Footnote 45 Cyber attackers make Herculean efforts to hide their identity to reduce the likelihood of retaliation. Footnote 46 To avoid escalation and diplomatic discord, it is crucial that the counter-attacker determine that its target is the actual attacker. Here the advantages of cyber defence for counter-attack come into focus. A capable cyber defender gathers extensive information on the attacker, including its methods and intentions, which, with human and other technical intelligence, can be used to arrive at the attacker’s identity. The longer the cyber defender observes the attacker, the better the overall intelligence package. In cyberspace, the best offence may emerge from a stalwart defence.\n\nAI and quantum computing are sometimes seen as shifting the balance in cyber warfare decisively to the offence. This seems far from certain. AI is likely be as effective on defence as it is on offence. AI is being used, for example, to develop intrusion-detection systems that ‘outperform other techniques because of their flexibility, adaptability, rapid calculations, and quick learning’. Footnote 47 While quantum computing will make it harder for defenders to encrypt their networks, cyber-security experts have begun designing essentially quantum-proof encryption. Footnote 48\n\nBen Buchanan argues that there is a security dilemma in the cyber domain that will drive states to engage in offensive cyber operations. The logic is that states must offensively penetrate their",
    "potential adversaries' networks to discover what offensive capabilities they possess; they, in turn, could interpret these intrusions as precursors to an attack or the attack itself, eliciting a cyber counter-attack and potentially triggering an escalatory spiral. Footnote  $^{49}$  Yet full consideration of the advantages of the cyber defence can dampen this logic. One key reason nation-states might engage in offensive cyber intrusions is that they think that their identity will remain hidden. But a defender who mobilises the advantages of cyber defence can use the information it gains to identify the potential attacker. Beyond that, the defender can use the information about the attacker's capabilities to launch a precisely targeted counter-attack. This capability constitutes a substantial deterrent.\n\nAgain, offensive capabilities are a necessary part of cyber national security, and penetrating networks will prove essential in any conflict spanning multiple domains. But defenders do not always need to attack opposing networks to develop and hone their offensive cyber capabilities. This can be done through red-teaming, which has become a common practice in network defence in cyberspace. Companies like MITRE and FireEye develop offensive cyber tools to stress-test the networks of their customers. Structurally, as cyber defence becomes stronger, offensive intrusions will require more and more resources, decreasing their efficiency over time. Money and time – the latter being a resource we can never recover – will be better spent on cyber defence. Without doubt, incentives will remain to engage in intrusions, albeit in the name of defence, but undertaking them will become increasingly risky and inefficient, and the incentives for doing so correspondingly diminished. Accordingly, the intensity of the cybersecurity dilemma is likely to decrease.\n\n\\*\n\nWe have painted a rather optimistic picture of the future of cyber defence, and we acknowledge that it is hardly guaranteed. As in conventional war, the offence-defence balance is not static. For now, however, advances in cyber-security technology have made it easier to harness the advantages of cyber defence. The balance has shifted towards the defender and is likely to shift still further in its favour.
