Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*\nWhether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II¹ or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War,² deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race,³ where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities.⁴ Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace.⁵ Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility.⁶ With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.⁷\n---\n¹ U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n² John S.

POST, Jan. 19, 2013, (available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-to-boost-cybersecurity-\nAlong with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber \"forces\" or \"weaponry\" through a neutral state?\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n## II. NEUTRALITY\nModern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.⁸\n## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907\nThe 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically\n⁸ For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes. RODERICK OGLEY, THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 199 (1970).\n72 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\ndirected at articulating the rights and obligations of neutral states as well as the rights and obligations of belligerents towards neutral states. Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today⁹ and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\n1. Hague V: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.”¹⁰ The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1¹¹ but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.¹²\nArticle 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”¹³ Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.¹⁴\nArticle 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”¹⁵ In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\nCyber Neutrality 73\n⁹ U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n¹⁰ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n¹¹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para. XIII.A.1, at 35(2012) [hereinafter ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK].\n¹² See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8 (creating a neutrality exception when using publicly available communication networks).\n¹³ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n¹⁴ See James Brown Scott, The Reports to the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, at 539 (1917) [hereinafter Hague Reports].\n¹⁵ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\nArticle 4 prevents belligerents from forming a “corps of combatants…on the territory of a neutral Power to assist the belligerents.”¹⁶ Would this prevent a belligerent from forming a botnet¹⁷ on the territory of a neutral that could launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on enemy command and control networks?\nArticle 5 highlights the key duty of a neutral power, namely to prevent belligerents from performing any of the actions prohibited in Articles 2 through 4.¹⁸ Neutral states may even be required to apply force to comply with these duties.¹⁹ Practically speaking, how could a neutral state prevent belligerents from using its infrastructure if belligerent cyber activities amounted to a violation of Article 2, 3, or 4?\nArticle 8 lays out an important exception when it comes to the applicability of Hague V to cyber operations. Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.”²⁰ While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.”²¹ Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.”²² One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica-\n¹⁶ *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n¹⁷ “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail . . . The computer is compromised via a Trojan that often works by opening an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel that waits for commands from the person in control of the botnet.

Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War\nWhile Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed,²⁵ while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited.²⁶ Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.”²⁷ Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n### 1. International Armed Conflict vs. Non-international Armed Conflict\nStrictly speaking, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII only apply to international armed conflicts (IAC) between signatory nations.²⁸ While initially limited to state parties,²⁹ the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII are also now\n²³ See Hague Reports, *supra* note 14, at 543.\n²⁴ *Id.*\n²⁵ Convention Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War art. 10, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2415 [hereinafter Hague XIII].\n²⁶ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 8.\n²⁷ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 5.\n²⁸ See Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 20; Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art. 28.\n²⁹ *Id.*\nCyber Neutrality 75\nbinding on all states as customary international law.³⁰ Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency.³¹ Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states.³² However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.³³\nA civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC).³⁴ However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs,³⁵ the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply.³⁶ However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”³⁷ This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.³⁸\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nIn the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says:\nAny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.³⁹\nHowever, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”⁴⁰\n## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality\nIn addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n### (a) United Nations Charter\nThe post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear.⁴¹ Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war,⁴² which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.”⁴³ With nearly all sovereign\n³⁹ INT’L COMM.

Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require⁴⁵ all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42.⁴⁶ However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice.⁴⁷ While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights⁴⁸ held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States⁴⁹ often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war.⁵⁰ Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes,⁵¹ including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,”⁵² hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context.⁵³ Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.⁵⁴\n⁴⁴ See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n⁴⁵ U.N.

Walker, Information Warfare\n78 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\n(b) Other Collective Security Agreements\nHowever, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members⁵⁵ of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”⁵⁶ This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”⁵⁷ By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area.⁵⁸ The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan,⁵⁹ South Korea,⁶⁰ and the Philippines⁶¹ that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.”⁶² The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting\nand Neutrality, 33 VAND.

Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations,⁶⁵ how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace\nEven though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace.⁶⁶ Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.⁶⁷\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nWhile the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would\n88 (July 8) (“The Court finds that as in the case of the principles of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict, international law leaves no doubt that the principle of neutrality, whatever its content, which is of a fundamental character similar to that of the humanitarian principles and rules, is applicable (subject to the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter), to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used.”).\n68 See Hague V, supra note 10, Preamble.\n69 See Hague XIII, supra note 25, Preamble.\n70 Georgios C.

If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations\n⁷⁴ Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n⁷⁵ *Id.*\n⁷⁶ See generally Lt Col. Patrick W.

The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory.⁷⁸ In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.”⁷⁹ The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.”⁸⁰ The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.”⁸¹ The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies.⁸² The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population.⁸³ In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral\n⁷⁸ Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n⁷⁹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n⁸⁰ OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n⁸² Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n⁸³ Id. at 542.\nCyber Neutrality 83\nstates, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming \"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the \"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\" that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term \"combatant\" makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\n84 Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n85 Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 540.\n86 ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 11, Ch. 2 para.

Hague V, supra note 10, art. 6.\nan individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\nCyber Neutrality 85\nIn order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE\nMeaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility\nThe purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93\nArticle 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nbeen empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7.⁹⁶ Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”⁹⁷\nArticle 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁹⁸ A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor.⁹⁹ Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.”¹⁰⁰ Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group.¹⁰¹ While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged.¹⁰² The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹⁰³ However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n⁹⁶ Id. at art. 7.\n⁹⁷ Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n⁹⁸ Id. at art. 8.\n⁹⁹ Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n¹⁰⁰ Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n¹⁰¹ See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n¹⁰² Id. at 315.\n¹⁰³ Id. at 115.\nCyber Neutrality 87\nin breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”¹⁰⁴\nThe commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation.¹⁰⁵ In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters.¹⁰⁶ The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability.¹⁰⁷ Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.”¹⁰⁸ The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.”¹⁰⁹ The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities.¹¹⁰ This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.¹¹¹\n¹⁰⁴ ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n¹⁰⁵ Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n¹⁰⁶ Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n¹⁰⁷ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁸ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁹ Id. at 18.\n¹¹⁰ Id. at 18-20.\n¹¹¹ See, e.g., Scott J.

REV. 817, 855 (2012).\n88 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nB. Technical and Human Attribution\nAttribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security.[112] A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets.[113] Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message.[114] Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.[115]\nOne of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or \"spoofed.\"[116] While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly.[117] While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking\nCyber Neutrality\na response.¹¹⁸ When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.¹¹⁹\nWhen the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies.¹²⁰ Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination.¹²¹ Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address.¹²² Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity¹²³ and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient.¹²⁴ However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message.¹²⁵ Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination.¹²⁶ Tor is a publicly available onion routing service¹²⁷ and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others.¹²⁸ Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.¹²⁹\nDespite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses\n¹¹⁸ Id. at 537-38.\n¹¹⁹ Id. at 537.\n¹²⁰ W.

As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest,¹³⁵ that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered.¹³⁶ According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries.¹³⁷ The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions.¹³⁸ The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems.¹³⁹ In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access.¹⁴⁰ Additionally, because the telecommunica\n¹³⁰ See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n¹³¹ Id. at 39-40.\n¹³² Id. at 40.\n¹³³ Id.\n¹³⁴ David E.

Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes\nEven if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n## IV. CASE STUDIES\nWhile there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n¹⁴¹ Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

Estonia\n1. Background\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online.¹⁴⁴ In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial.¹⁴⁵ The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians.¹⁴⁶ Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks.¹⁴⁷ These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects.¹⁴⁸ While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.¹⁴⁹\n2. Neutrality Analysis\nBecause these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force.¹⁵⁰ While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions,¹⁵¹ it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n¹⁴⁴ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n¹⁴⁵ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n¹⁴⁶ *Id.* at 15.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.* at 18-21.\n¹⁴⁸ *Id.* at 24-25.\n¹⁴⁹ *Id.* at 23.\n¹⁵⁰ Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n¹⁵¹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\nCyber Neutrality 93\nMost of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS).¹⁵² This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses.¹⁵³ The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance.¹⁵⁴ Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area.¹⁵⁵ While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems,¹⁵⁶ they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights.¹⁵⁷ What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict,¹⁵⁸ exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces. However, because of the way DoS attacks work, often enslaving computers all over the world, fully applying neutrality rules to the activity of\n¹⁵² Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 21.\n¹⁵³ EA-6B Prowler Mission, Description, and Specifications, Naval Air Systems Command Website, available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=C8B54023-C006-4699-BD20-9A45FBA02B9A (last visited Apr 13, 2013) [hereinafter, EA-6B Details].\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ David Axe, Secret Army Bomb Jammers Stolen in Afghanistan, WIRED, Mar. 1, 2012, available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/bomb-jammers-stolen/.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n¹⁵⁷ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n¹⁵⁸ See supra notes 70-71 and accompanying text.\n94 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nevery computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.”¹⁵⁹ If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\nB. Georgia\n1. Background\nWhile the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia.¹⁶⁰ On August 8, 2008, Russian military\n¹⁵⁹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n¹⁶⁰ Id. at 67.\nCyber Neutrality 95\nforces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military.¹⁶¹ In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war.¹⁶² Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8,¹⁶³ although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities.¹⁶⁴ While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information.¹⁶⁵ The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites.¹⁶⁶ The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website.¹⁶⁷ As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets.¹⁶⁸ However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.¹⁶⁹\nAnother important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites.¹⁷⁰ Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government.¹⁷¹ The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.”¹⁷² After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.¹⁷³\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nCyber Neutrality 97\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\nThis conflict between Russia and Georgia raised two significant cyber neutrality issues. The first concerns the neutrality rights of Turkey while the second concerns the neutrality rights of the United States.\n### (a) Turkish Neutrality\nWhile Turkey did not formally declare itself to be a neutral in the Russian-Georgian armed conflict, which technically only lasted five days,¹⁷⁴ official Turkish statements suggested a desire to remain neutral. Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated:\n&gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.¹⁷⁵\nThese statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey,¹⁷⁶ Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral.¹⁷⁷ From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey\n---\n¹⁷⁴ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n¹⁷⁵ Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n¹⁷⁶ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n¹⁷⁷ Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.\nas taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities¹⁷⁸ and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action.¹⁷⁹ From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2¹⁸⁰ and Article 3¹⁸¹ could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the\n¹⁷⁸ See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n¹⁷⁹ Id. at art. 52.\n¹⁸⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n¹⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\n98 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nmeaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military.¹⁸² The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n## (b) United States' Neutrality\nThe second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral.¹⁸³ By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces”¹⁸⁴ on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.¹⁸⁵\nSome might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk.¹⁸⁶ While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities.¹⁸⁷ In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.”¹⁸⁸ It goes on to say that civilians who take “part\n¹⁸² For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n¹⁸³ Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n¹⁸⁴ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n¹⁸⁵ Id. at art. 5.\n¹⁸⁶ See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n¹⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n¹⁸⁸ Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8\nCyber Neutrality 99\nin armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.”¹⁸⁹ Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n## C. Stuxnet\nThe previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.\n## 1. Background\nOn June 17, 2010, an employee at VirusBlokAda, a small computer security firm in Belarus, read a report from a client in Iran showing that the client’s computer was continuously rebooting.¹⁹¹ The rebooting problem indicated a potential virus and employees at VirusBlokAda soon began analyzing the system for malicious software.¹⁹² They discovered a zero-day exploit in Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer.¹⁹³ Zero-day exploits are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to its designers and they are quite rare.¹⁹⁴ Software analysis later discovered that Stuxnet took advantage of several additional Windows vulnerabilities, including additional\nJUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, 618 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987).\n¹⁸⁹ Id.\n¹⁹⁰ See Michael N.

Bush demanded a “third option” besides letting Iran develop a nuclear weapon or starting a war with Iran.²⁰³ Stuxnet became that third option. According to Sanger, the goal was to capitalize on Iran’s volatile centrifuge design by initiating a series of apparently random centrifuge failures, with the hope that Iranian authorities would lose faith in the design, the parts, and/or their engineers.²⁰⁴\nOne of Stuxnet’s most intriguing aspects was its delivery. Natanz is a secure facility that is not connected to the Internet so its designers had to figure out a way to bridge the “air gap.”²⁰⁵ According to Symantec, Stuxnet was designed to spread\n¹⁹⁵ Nicolas Falliere et al., W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, Symantec Security Response 2 (Feb. 2011), available at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf [hereinafter, Stuxnet Dossier].\n¹⁹⁶ Zetter, supra note 191 (combining the file names .stub and MrxNet.sys from the software code).\n¹⁹⁷ Id.\n¹⁹⁸ Id.\n¹⁹⁹ Id.\n²⁰⁰ Id.\n²⁰¹ DAVID E.

Neutrality Analysis\nWhile Stuxnet did not occur during an armed conflict and therefore did not directly raise any neutrality issues, it did prove an effective operational concept that will likely be used in future conflicts. As evidenced by the Estonia and Georgia\n²⁰⁶ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 2. Interestingly, the United States Department of Defense banned the use of thumb drives around this same time.

With Stuxnet’s code now available for anyone to tinker with or modify, it is reasonable to assume that the next major international conflict will include malware similar to, or modeled after, Stuxnet. For example, industrial control systems, similar to the one used at Natanz, are found in petroleum refinement plants, chemical production plants, and electrical power generation and transmission plants.²¹⁷ It is fairly easy to imagine any of these plants as constituting a legitimate military target during a future armed conflict.\nUsing malware like Stuxnet in an armed conflict would raise at least two significant neutrality concerns: (1) the location of command and control servers and (2) delivery routes. The analysis of the command and control server issue is similar for a Stuxnet-type operation as it would be for a DoS attack but the arguments are stronger. Stuxnet used at least two different command and control servers, one in Malaysia and one in Denmark, but could have been updated throughout the operation to communicate with different command and control servers.²¹⁸ If Stuxnet had occurred during the course of an armed conflict, Malaysia and Denmark would have been in a difficult position. If Stuxnet was developed as a way to achieve effects comparable to attacking Natanz with conventional weapons,²¹⁹ it essentially substituted for conventional weapons. When military planners can use certain cyber capabilities and conventional weapons interchangeably, it defies logic to apply the neutrality rules to one and not the other.\nWith respect to Hague V, the analysis remains the same for the command and controls servers in the Stuxnet context as it does in the DoS attack context. The command and control servers in this scenario would be acting as virtual “wireless telegraphy stations” for the purpose of “communicating with belligerent forces” in violation of Article 3.²²⁰ The Stuxnet command and control servers compiled data received from each infected computer²²¹ and presumably sent that data to Stuxnet’s creators. Additionally, Stuxnet’s creators likely used the command and control servers to push updated versions of the code out to infected computers.²²² In an armed conflict scenario, it would be difficult to argue that these command and control servers are not communicating with belligerent forces. Furthermore, if malware has the ability to shut down a power grid or cripple an oil refinery, a belligerent may be more likely to respond militarily once it discovers the threat. Such a response might include damaging or disabling any known command and control servers or other\n²¹⁷ SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CENTER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE SECURITY POSTURE OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (Version 1.1, Aug. 20, 2010), available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/ics/ics_fact_sheet.pdf.\n²¹⁸ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²¹⁹ SANGER, supra note 201, at 188-191.\n²²⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n²²¹ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²²² Zetter, supra note 191.\nCyber Neutrality 103\nvital network elements residing in that neutral state. As the likelihood of a military response against a neutral state’s network components increases, so does the need to apply the law of neutrality in order to prevent the spread of conflict.\nThe other aspect of Stuxnet that raises potential neutrality issues concerns the specific delivery path or paths the malicious code travels. Does the law of neutrality prohibit malicious packets of information from traveling over the network infrastructure of a neutral state on the way to a belligerent target? Applying the law of neutrality to this particular scenario is problematic for two reasons. First, individual packets might not all take the same route and users may not be able to control the route.²²³ Second, applicable neutrality rules are not likely needed in this situation to prevent the spread of conflict. Put another way, the fact that some packets travel over a neutral’s network on the way to a belligerent is not likely to trigger any military action against the neutral’s network. The Internet’s redundant design means that any military action to shut down one particular route would not have much, or any, practical effect; the packets will just take a different route.²²⁴ While not a perfect fit, this narrow situation should still fall under the scope of Hague V’s telegraph exception.²²⁵ The telegraph exception was largely based on practical limitations²²⁶ that are especially applicable to controlling or monitoring the delivery routes of individual packets. Furthermore, using the roads analogy discussed earlier, it is more appropriate to view the telecommunications service provider as transporting the code in this scenario since it is the service provider who is directing the path, not the belligerent.\nWhile it may not be appropriate to apply the neutrality rules to the delivery routes of individual packets in most cases, it is important to distinguish the situation where a belligerent uses a proxy in a neutral state. While belligerents may not be able to control the specific routes packets take, a belligerent ensures the packets go through a neutral state by using a proxy in that neutral state. A belligerent may use a proxy in a neutral state in order to make it appear as if the neutral state is supporting its effort or simply because the enemy may not scrutinize Internet traffic emanating from that neutral country in the same way it scrutinizes other Internet traffic. Either way, the deliberate use of proxy in a neutral state is likely an attempt to derive some form of military advantage from a neutral’s territorial infrastructure and is prohibited.²²⁷ This essentially collapses the neutrality analysis for the delivery of packets into an intent-based analysis, an approach often advocated.²²⁸ Addition-\n²²³ See Boebert, supra note 120, at 41-42.\n²²⁴ See id. at 42.\n²²⁵ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8.\n²²⁶ See Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 543.\n²²⁷ See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 1 (“The territory of neutral States is inviolable.”).\n²²⁸ See, e.g., Davis Brown, A Proposal for an International Convention to Regulate the Use of Information Systems in Armed Conflict, 47 HARV.

Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principles of Distinction and\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nally, while there may not be much practical value in taking military action against a neutral’s network that is only carrying packets, “bricking”²²⁹ a proxy may be an effective countermeasure. Neutral states should not become cyber battle grounds for belligerents, where the burden of collateral damage would rest entirely on the neutral state.\nAs in the Georgia example, attribution limitations will not bar military action. Attribution limitations are certainly relevant, especially in conducting a proportionality analysis, but the fact remains that objects which are being used to “make an effective contribution to military action” are military objects and may be attacked.²³⁰ Every proxy computer in the chain would likely meet this definition and would therefore be subject to attack. For that matter, the cables that merely carry packets could also qualify as military, or dual-use, objects but the negligible military advantage to be gained by attacking them might be difficult to justify under a proportionality analysis.²³¹ As with the DoS attack scenario, it is technical attribution to a particular node/computer that triggers a belligerent’s ability to take military action against that particular node/computer, regardless of whether the belligerent can further attribute the conduct to a person, organization, or government.²³²\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe neutrality rules are over a hundred years old and did not envision modern cyber capabilities but technological innovation in weaponry is nothing new. When cyber capabilities can viably substitute for conventional capabilities, whether they are damage-causing or damage-enabling capabilities, the neutrality rules must equally apply in order to preserve state sovereignty. Without applicable neutrality rules, belligerents will derive strategic advantages by purposely exploiting components of a neutral state’s infrastructure. Allowing the cyber component of the battlefield to expand to neutral states erodes a neutral state’s ability to stay out of a conflict. Belligerents do not seek symmetric responses. They constantly seek opportunities to overwhelm the enemy in the place and manner where they perceive an advantage. There is no guarantee that the cyber component of the battlefield could spread to neutral states without the conventional battlefield expanding there as well.\nAttribution remains a challenge, especially when it comes to punishing belligerents who might choose to violate a neutral state’s rights. Not only is technical attribution difficult but holding a state responsible also requires human attribution.\nNeutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Mich. L.

However, as evidenced by the Mandiant report, large, prolonged cyber operations may be difficult to conceal indefinitely. Additionally, belligerents with sophisticated cyber capabilities may also rigorously monitor and control their own networks, strengthening attribution arguments based on Corfu Channel’s rationale. Finally, while attribution certainly poses a problem in holding belligerents responsible for neutrality violations, it is less important when the neutrality rules are used to impose a duty on neutral states. Neutral states may not have the incentive to dedicate the resources necessary to monitor their own networks, but belligerents do. When a belligerent traces malicious cyber activity to components of a neutral state’s infrastructure, it should be able to require the neutral state to take appropriate action if that state wants to remain neutral.\nAs with most areas of the law, technological advances create challenges. Sometimes the law is amended to explicitly deal with new technologies and sometimes the old law is interpreted to cover (or not cover) new technologies. When it comes to cyber capabilities and the law of neutrality, gaining international consensus to amend the law may not be possible and interpreting the law to not cover cyber operations threatens the entire institution of neutrality. By interpreting the neutrality rules with a focus on their purpose, states can usher respect for neutrality into twenty-first century warfare and continue to decide for themselves if and when to enter a conflict.\n106 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71",

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*\nWhether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War, deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race, where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities. Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace. Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility. With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.\n---\n U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n John S.

POST, Jan. 19, 2013, (available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-to-boost-cybersecurity-\nAlong with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber \"forces\" or \"weaponry\" through a neutral state?\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n## II. NEUTRALITY\nModern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.\n## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907\nThe 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically\n For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes. RODERICK OGLEY, THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 199 (1970).\n\ndirected at articulating the rights and obligations of neutral states as well as the rights and obligations of belligerents towards neutral states. Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\n1. Hague V: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.” The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1 but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.\nArticle 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.” Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.\nArticle 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.” In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\nCyber Neutrality 73\n U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para. XIII.A.1, at 35(2012) [hereinafter ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK].\n See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8 (creating a neutrality exception when using publicly available communication networks).\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n See James Brown Scott, The Reports to the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, at 539 (1917) [hereinafter Hague Reports].\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\nArticle 4 prevents belligerents from forming a “corps of combatants…on the territory of a neutral Power to assist the belligerents.” Would this prevent a belligerent from forming a botnet on the territory of a neutral that could launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on enemy command and control networks?\nArticle 5 highlights the key duty of a neutral power, namely to prevent belligerents from performing any of the actions prohibited in Articles 2 through 4. Neutral states may even be required to apply force to comply with these duties. Practically speaking, how could a neutral state prevent belligerents from using its infrastructure if belligerent cyber activities amounted to a violation of Article 2, 3, or 4?\nArticle 8 lays out an important exception when it comes to the applicability of Hague V to cyber operations. Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.” Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.” One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica-\n *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail . . .

The official report of the 1907 Hague conference states that requiring neutrals to prevent belligerents from using these lines would encounter “objections of a practical kind . . . arising out of the considerable difficulties in exercising control, not to mention the confidential character of telegraphic correspondence and the rapidity necessary to this service.” If modern technology can diminish some of those enforcement concerns, it would seem to make less sense to interpret Article 8 as sanctioning offensive cyber operations.\n## 2. Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War\nWhile Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed, while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited. Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.” Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n### 1. International Armed Conflict vs. Non-international Armed Conflict\nStrictly speaking, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII only apply to international armed conflicts (IAC) between signatory nations. While initially limited to state parties, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII are also now\n See Hague Reports, *supra* note 14, at 543.\n *Id.*\n Convention Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War art. 10, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2415 [hereinafter Hague XIII].\n Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 8.\n Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 5.\n See Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 20; Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art. 28.\n *Id.*\nCyber Neutrality 75\nbinding on all states as customary international law. Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency. Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states. However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.\nA civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC). However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs, the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply. However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nIn the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says:\nAny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.\nHowever, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”\n## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality\nIn addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n### (a) United Nations Charter\nThe post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear. Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war, which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.” With nearly all sovereign\n INT’L COMM.

Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42. However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice. While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war. Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes, including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,” hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context. Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.\n See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n U.N.

Jensen, Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 820 (2012); Bridgeman, supra note 30, at 1208-09; George K. Walker, Information Warfare\n\n(b) Other Collective Security Agreements\nHowever, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.” This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.” By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area. The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.” The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting\nand Neutrality, 33 VAND.

Additionally, while not officially recognizing Taiwan as an independent state, the United States has continually expressed its commitment to defend Taiwan.\nWhile the United States has collective security agreements that span the globe and appears destined for belligerency in just about any future IAC, not all states have such widespread commitments. Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations, how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace\nEven though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace. Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nWhile the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would\n\nCyber Neutrality 81\nlikely be viewed as a use of force.” Koh went on to say “[a] State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof.” While it is unclear to what extent the international community embraces the ability to assert self-defense rights in response to a malicious cyber activity, with the United States taking an unequivocal position and NATO suggesting a similar stance, others may follow.\nIt is a state’s ability to assert self-defense rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter that is so important to the neutrality analysis. If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations\n Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n *Id.*\n See generally Lt Col. Patrick W. Franzese, *Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 64 A.F. L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2009).\n See *Defending the Networks: The NATO Policy on Cyber Defence*, N. Atl. Treaty Org. (2011), available at http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_2011_09/20111004_110914-policy-cyberdefence.pdf (stating “... NATO will defend its territory and populations against all threats, including emerging security challenges such as cyber defence” and “NATO will maintain strategic ambiguity as well as flexibility on how to respond to different types of crises that include a cyber component.”).\n\nstressed in Hague V will still serve as distinct boundaries in the analysis. The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory. In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.” The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.” The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.” The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies. The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population. In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral\n Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n Id. at 542.\nCyber Neutrality 83\nstates, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming \"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the \"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\" that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term \"combatant\" makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\n\nan individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\nCyber Neutrality 85\nIn order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE\nMeaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility\nThe purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93\nArticle 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nbeen empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7. Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”\nArticle 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.” A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor. Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.” Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group. While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged. The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.” However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n Id. at art. 7.\n Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n Id. at art. 8.\n Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n Id. at 315.\n Id. at 115.\nCyber Neutrality 87\nin breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”\nThe commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation. In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters. The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability. Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.” The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.” The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities. This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.\n ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18-20.\n See, e.g., Scott J. Shackleford and Richard B. Andres, State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks: Competing Standards for a Growing Problem, 42 GEO J. INT’L L. 971, 989 (2011); Oona A. Hathaway, Rebecca Crootof, Philip Levitz, Haley Nix, Aileen Nowlan, William Perdue, Julia Spiegel, The Law of Cyber Attack, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 855 (2012).\n\nB. Technical and Human Attribution\nAttribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security.[112] A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets.[113] Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message.[114] Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.[115]\nOne of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or \"spoofed.\"[116] While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly.[117] While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking\nCyber Neutrality\na response. When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.\nWhen the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies. Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination. Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address. Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient. However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message. Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination. Tor is a publicly available onion routing service and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others. Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.\nDespite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses\n Id. at 537-38.\n Id. at 537.\n W. Earl Boebert, *A Survey of Challenges in Attribution*, in *COMM. ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS, NAT’L RESEARCH COUNCIL, PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY*, at 45 (2010), available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12997.html.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 46.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Clark, supra note 113, at 546.\n Id. at 542-43.\n\nregistered in China. According to the report, Chinese hackers frequently hijacked third party computers, using tools such as Remote Desktop, before hacking the target computers. However, Mandiant claims to have traced the link between the hacker and the hijacked computer in 1,905 instances from January 2011 to January 2013. The connection was traced to 832 IP addresses, 817 of which were registered in China and mainly belonged to one of four large blocks of IP addresses that service Shanghai. Chinese authorities have boisterously denied responsibility, calling Mandiant’s report “irresponsible and unprofessional.” Technical aspects alone should probably not conclusively establish an origination point. As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest, that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered. According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries. The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions. The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems. In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access. Additionally, because the telecommunica\n See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n Id. at 39-40.\n Id. at 40.\n Id.\n David E.

Under Corfu Channel, knowledge coupled with the failure to warn or take other adequate measures to prevent harm, is in itself an internationally wrongful act, regardless of who actually controls the computer.\n## C. Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes\nEven if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n## IV. CASE STUDIES\nWhile there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

Estonia\n1. Background\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online. In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial. The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians. Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks. These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects. While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.\n2. Neutrality Analysis\nBecause these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force. While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions, it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n *Id.* at 15.\n *Id.* at 18-21.\n *Id.* at 24-25.\n *Id.* at 23.\n Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\nCyber Neutrality 93\nMost of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS). This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses. The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance. Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area. While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems, they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights. What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict, exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces. However, because of the way DoS attacks work, often enslaving computers all over the world, fully applying neutrality rules to the activity of\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 21.\n EA-6B Prowler Mission, Description, and Specifications, Naval Air Systems Command Website, available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=C8B54023-C006-4699-BD20-9A45FBA02B9A (last visited Apr 13, 2013) [hereinafter, EA-6B Details].\n Id.\n David Axe, Secret Army Bomb Jammers Stolen in Afghanistan, WIRED, Mar. 1, 2012, available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/bomb-jammers-stolen/.\n Id.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n See supra notes 70-71 and accompanying text.\n\nevery computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.” If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\nB. Georgia\n1. Background\nWhile the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. On August 8, 2008, Russian military\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n Id. at 67.\nCyber Neutrality 95\nforces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military. In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war. Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8, although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities. While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information. The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites. The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website. As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets. However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.\nAnother important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites. Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government. The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.” After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nCyber Neutrality 97\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\nThis conflict between Russia and Georgia raised two significant cyber neutrality issues. The first concerns the neutrality rights of Turkey while the second concerns the neutrality rights of the United States.\n### (a) Turkish Neutrality\nWhile Turkey did not formally declare itself to be a neutral in the Russian-Georgian armed conflict, which technically only lasted five days, official Turkish statements suggested a desire to remain neutral. Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated:\n&gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.\nThese statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey, Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral. From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey\n---\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.\nas taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action. From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2 and Article 3 could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the\n See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n Id. at art. 52.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\n\nmeaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military. The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n## (b) United States' Neutrality\nThe second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral. By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces” on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.\nSome might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk. While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities. In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.” It goes on to say that civilians who take “part\n For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n Id. at art. 5.\n See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8\nCyber Neutrality 99\nin armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.” Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities. It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n## C. Stuxnet\nThe previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.\n## 1. Background\nOn June 17, 2010, an employee at VirusBlokAda, a small computer security firm in Belarus, read a report from a client in Iran showing that the client’s computer was continuously rebooting. The rebooting problem indicated a potential virus and employees at VirusBlokAda soon began analyzing the system for malicious software. They discovered a zero-day exploit in Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer. Zero-day exploits are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to its designers and they are quite rare. Software analysis later discovered that Stuxnet took advantage of several additional Windows vulnerabilities, including additional\nJUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, 618 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987).\n Id.\n See Michael N. Schmitt, The Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities: A Critical Analysis, 1 HARV. NAT’L. SEC. J. 5, 26-27 (2010).\n Kim Zetter, How Digital Detectives Deciphered Stuxnet, the Most Menacing Malware in History, WIRED, (July 11, 2011, 7), available at http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet-the-most-menacing-malware-in-history/.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nzero-day exploits. A few weeks later, VirusBlokAda employees reported the zero-day exploit and the malicious software to Microsoft, which later nicknamed the malicious code Stuxnet.\nAs software engineers worldwide began dissecting Stuxnet’s code, they discovered that it was designed to target specific industrial control software designed by Siemens, the very same software used by Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility. Other aspects of the code, such as only targeting configurations containing 164 devices and references to a specific frequency, 1064Hz, seemed to confirm Natanz as the code’s target. Once Stuxnet found its target, it was designed to do two things: 1) periodically speed up and slow down certain motors connected to a frequency converter, and 2) trick monitoring systems by replacing status reports and shutting off system alarms. This allowed Stuxnet to alter the normal operation of the industrial control system without raising operator awareness.\nIranian centrifuges, used for enriching uranium, are based off of a Pakistani design and have a reputation for being extremely temperamental, “subject to periodic, random explosion.” In David Sanger’s 2012 book, *Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power*, he says Stuxnet was a joint operation named “Olympic Games” between the United States and Israel. Sanger says Olympic Games dated back to 2006 when President George W. Bush demanded a “third option” besides letting Iran develop a nuclear weapon or starting a war with Iran. Stuxnet became that third option. According to Sanger, the goal was to capitalize on Iran’s volatile centrifuge design by initiating a series of apparently random centrifuge failures, with the hope that Iranian authorities would lose faith in the design, the parts, and/or their engineers.\nOne of Stuxnet’s most intriguing aspects was its delivery. Natanz is a secure facility that is not connected to the Internet so its designers had to figure out a way to bridge the “air gap.” According to Symantec, Stuxnet was designed to spread\n Nicolas Falliere et al., W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, Symantec Security Response 2 (Feb. 2011), available at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf [hereinafter, Stuxnet Dossier].\n Zetter, supra note 191 (combining the file names .stub and MrxNet.sys from the software code).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n DAVID E.

Stuxnet was designed to infect the computer systems of people with access to Natanz, who then might plug a laptop or a thumb drive into Natanz’s closed network. Additionally, each time Stuxnet infected a computer it would gather some basic information about the system, such as the machine’s internal and external IP addresses, its name, details about the operating system, and whether it contained Siemens industrial control software. Stuxnet would then report this information to a central command and control server attached to one or more domain names. Symantec identified two of these command and control servers, one in Denmark and one in Malaysia. The command and control servers could directly install updated versions of Stuxnet or other files on infected machines. Additionally, infected computers continuously searched LANs or connected devices for updated versions of the code. This meant that so long as Natanz insiders kept connecting thumb drives and laptops to both open and closed networks, updated versions of Stuxnet would eventually infect all targeted systems.\nWhile Stuxnet eventually spread to 155 different countries (as a result of an unintended programming mistake), Symantec says it was initially targeted at five different organizations, all with a “presence in Iran”. Interestingly, the shortest time between the software compile time and initial infection time was 12 hours. Such a short time between when the code was completed to when it infected a machine with an “Iranian presence” suggests that the code was initially delivered via the Internet as opposed to being covertly installed by hand.\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\nWhile Stuxnet did not occur during an armed conflict and therefore did not directly raise any neutrality issues, it did prove an effective operational concept that will likely be used in future conflicts. As evidenced by the Estonia and Georgia\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 2. Interestingly, the United States Department of Defense banned the use of thumb drives around this same time. See Noah Shachtman, Under Worm Assault, Military Bans Disks, USB Drives, WIRED (Nov. 19, 2008 3:12 PM), available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/army-bans-usb-d/.\n SANGER, supra 201, at 196.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\n Id.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 21.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 34.\n Id. at 6.\n SANGER, supra 201, at 204-205.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 7.\n Id.\n\nexamples, military leaders are seemingly learning the value of effective cyber operations and will likely incorporate them into future war plans. With Stuxnet’s code now available for anyone to tinker with or modify, it is reasonable to assume that the next major international conflict will include malware similar to, or modeled after, Stuxnet. For example, industrial control systems, similar to the one used at Natanz, are found in petroleum refinement plants, chemical production plants, and electrical power generation and transmission plants. It is fairly easy to imagine any of these plants as constituting a legitimate military target during a future armed conflict.\nUsing malware like Stuxnet in an armed conflict would raise at least two significant neutrality concerns: (1) the location of command and control servers and (2) delivery routes. The analysis of the command and control server issue is similar for a Stuxnet-type operation as it would be for a DoS attack but the arguments are stronger. Stuxnet used at least two different command and control servers, one in Malaysia and one in Denmark, but could have been updated throughout the operation to communicate with different command and control servers. If Stuxnet had occurred during the course of an armed conflict, Malaysia and Denmark would have been in a difficult position. If Stuxnet was developed as a way to achieve effects comparable to attacking Natanz with conventional weapons, it essentially substituted for conventional weapons. When military planners can use certain cyber capabilities and conventional weapons interchangeably, it defies logic to apply the neutrality rules to one and not the other.\nWith respect to Hague V, the analysis remains the same for the command and controls servers in the Stuxnet context as it does in the DoS attack context. The command and control servers in this scenario would be acting as virtual “wireless telegraphy stations” for the purpose of “communicating with belligerent forces” in violation of Article 3. The Stuxnet command and control servers compiled data received from each infected computer and presumably sent that data to Stuxnet’s creators. Additionally, Stuxnet’s creators likely used the command and control servers to push updated versions of the code out to infected computers. In an armed conflict scenario, it would be difficult to argue that these command and control servers are not communicating with belligerent forces. Furthermore, if malware has the ability to shut down a power grid or cripple an oil refinery, a belligerent may be more likely to respond militarily once it discovers the threat. Such a response might include damaging or disabling any known command and control servers or other\n SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CENTER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE SECURITY POSTURE OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (Version 1.1, Aug. 20, 2010), available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/ics/ics_fact_sheet.pdf.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n SANGER, supra note 201, at 188-191.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\nCyber Neutrality 103\nvital network elements residing in that neutral state. As the likelihood of a military response against a neutral state’s network components increases, so does the need to apply the law of neutrality in order to prevent the spread of conflict.\nThe other aspect of Stuxnet that raises potential neutrality issues concerns the specific delivery path or paths the malicious code travels. Does the law of neutrality prohibit malicious packets of information from traveling over the network infrastructure of a neutral state on the way to a belligerent target? Applying the law of neutrality to this particular scenario is problematic for two reasons. First, individual packets might not all take the same route and users may not be able to control the route. Second, applicable neutrality rules are not likely needed in this situation to prevent the spread of conflict. Put another way, the fact that some packets travel over a neutral’s network on the way to a belligerent is not likely to trigger any military action against the neutral’s network. The Internet’s redundant design means that any military action to shut down one particular route would not have much, or any, practical effect; the packets will just take a different route. While not a perfect fit, this narrow situation should still fall under the scope of Hague V’s telegraph exception. The telegraph exception was largely based on practical limitations that are especially applicable to controlling or monitoring the delivery routes of individual packets. Furthermore, using the roads analogy discussed earlier, it is more appropriate to view the telecommunications service provider as transporting the code in this scenario since it is the service provider who is directing the path, not the belligerent.\nWhile it may not be appropriate to apply the neutrality rules to the delivery routes of individual packets in most cases, it is important to distinguish the situation where a belligerent uses a proxy in a neutral state. While belligerents may not be able to control the specific routes packets take, a belligerent ensures the packets go through a neutral state by using a proxy in that neutral state. A belligerent may use a proxy in a neutral state in order to make it appear as if the neutral state is supporting its effort or simply because the enemy may not scrutinize Internet traffic emanating from that neutral country in the same way it scrutinizes other Internet traffic. Either way, the deliberate use of proxy in a neutral state is likely an attempt to derive some form of military advantage from a neutral’s territorial infrastructure and is prohibited. This essentially collapses the neutrality analysis for the delivery of packets into an intent-based analysis, an approach often advocated.

Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principles of Distinction and\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nally, while there may not be much practical value in taking military action against a neutral’s network that is only carrying packets, “bricking” a proxy may be an effective countermeasure. Neutral states should not become cyber battle grounds for belligerents, where the burden of collateral damage would rest entirely on the neutral state.\nAs in the Georgia example, attribution limitations will not bar military action. Attribution limitations are certainly relevant, especially in conducting a proportionality analysis, but the fact remains that objects which are being used to “make an effective contribution to military action” are military objects and may be attacked. Every proxy computer in the chain would likely meet this definition and would therefore be subject to attack. For that matter, the cables that merely carry packets could also qualify as military, or dual-use, objects but the negligible military advantage to be gained by attacking them might be difficult to justify under a proportionality analysis. As with the DoS attack scenario, it is technical attribution to a particular node/computer that triggers a belligerent’s ability to take military action against that particular node/computer, regardless of whether the belligerent can further attribute the conduct to a person, organization, or government.\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe neutrality rules are over a hundred years old and did not envision modern cyber capabilities but technological innovation in weaponry is nothing new. When cyber capabilities can viably substitute for conventional capabilities, whether they are damage-causing or damage-enabling capabilities, the neutrality rules must equally apply in order to preserve state sovereignty. Without applicable neutrality rules, belligerents will derive strategic advantages by purposely exploiting components of a neutral state’s infrastructure. Allowing the cyber component of the battlefield to expand to neutral states erodes a neutral state’s ability to stay out of a conflict. Belligerents do not seek symmetric responses. They constantly seek opportunities to overwhelm the enemy in the place and manner where they perceive an advantage. There is no guarantee that the cyber component of the battlefield could spread to neutral states without the conventional battlefield expanding there as well.\nAttribution remains a challenge, especially when it comes to punishing belligerents who might choose to violate a neutral state’s rights. Not only is technical attribution difficult but holding a state responsible also requires human attribution.\nNeutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Mich. L.

However, as evidenced by the Mandiant report, large, prolonged cyber operations may be difficult to conceal indefinitely. Additionally, belligerents with sophisticated cyber capabilities may also rigorously monitor and control their own networks, strengthening attribution arguments based on Corfu Channel’s rationale. Finally, while attribution certainly poses a problem in holding belligerents responsible for neutrality violations, it is less important when the neutrality rules are used to impose a duty on neutral states. Neutral states may not have the incentive to dedicate the resources necessary to monitor their own networks, but belligerents do. When a belligerent traces malicious cyber activity to components of a neutral state’s infrastructure, it should be able to require the neutral state to take appropriate action if that state wants to remain neutral.\nAs with most areas of the law, technological advances create challenges. Sometimes the law is amended to explicitly deal with new technologies and sometimes the old law is interpreted to cover (or not cover) new technologies. When it comes to cyber capabilities and the law of neutrality, gaining international consensus to amend the law may not be possible and interpreting the law to not cover cyber operations threatens the entire institution of neutrality. By interpreting the neutrality rules with a focus on their purpose, states can usher respect for neutrality into twenty-first century warfare and continue to decide for themselves if and when to enter a conflict.",

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War* Whether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II¹ or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War,² deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race,³ where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities.⁴ Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace.⁵ Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility.⁶ With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.⁷ --- ¹ U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n² John S.

POST, Jan. 19, 2013, (available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-to-boost-cybersecurity- Along with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber\"forces\"or\"weaponry\"through a neutral state?\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n## II. NEUTRALITY Modern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.⁸ ## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 The 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically ⁸ For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes. RODERICK OGLEY, THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 199 (1970).\ndirected at articulating the rights and obligations of neutral states as well as the rights and obligations of belligerents towards neutral states. Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today⁹ and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.”¹⁰ The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1¹¹ but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.¹² Article 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”¹³ Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.¹⁴ Article 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”¹⁵ In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\nCyber Neutrality 73 ⁹ U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n¹⁰ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n¹¹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para. XIII.A.1, at 35(2012) [hereinafter ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK].\n¹² See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8 (creating a neutrality exception when using publicly available communication networks).\n¹³ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n¹⁴ See James Brown Scott, The Reports to the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, at 539 (1917) [hereinafter Hague Reports].\n¹⁵ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\nArticle 4 prevents belligerents from forming a “corps of combatants…on the territory of a neutral Power to assist the belligerents.”¹⁶ Would this prevent a belligerent from forming a botnet¹⁷ on the territory of a neutral that could launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on enemy command and control networks?\nArticle 5 highlights the key duty of a neutral power, namely to prevent belligerents from performing any of the actions prohibited in Articles 2 through 4.¹⁸ Neutral states may even be required to apply force to comply with these duties.¹⁹ Practically speaking, how could a neutral state prevent belligerents from using its infrastructure if belligerent cyber activities amounted to a violation of Article 2, 3, or 4?\nArticle 8 lays out an important exception when it comes to the applicability of Hague V to cyber operations. Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.”²⁰ While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.”²¹ Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.”²² One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica- ¹⁶ *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n¹⁷ “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail... The computer is compromised via a Trojan that often works by opening an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel that waits for commands from the person in control of the botnet. There is a thriving botnet business selling lists of compromised computers to hackers and spammers.” PC Magazine Online Dictionary, available at http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=botnet&amp;i=38866,00.asp.\n¹⁸ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 5.\n¹⁹ *Id.* at art. 10.\n²⁰ *Id.* at art. 8.\n²¹ *Id.* at art. 9.\n²² *Id.* at art. 9.\ntion lines.²³ The official report of the 1907 Hague conference states that requiring neutrals to prevent belligerents from using these lines would encounter “objections of a practical kind... arising out of the considerable difficulties in exercising control, not to mention the confidential character of telegraphic correspondence and the rapidity necessary to this service.”²⁴ If modern technology can diminish some of those enforcement concerns, it would seem to make less sense to interpret Article 8 as sanctioning offensive cyber operations.\n## 2. Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War While Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed,²⁵ while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited.²⁶ Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.”²⁷ Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n### 1. International Armed Conflict vs. Non-international Armed Conflict Strictly speaking, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII only apply to international armed conflicts (IAC) between signatory nations.²⁸ While initially limited to state parties,²⁹ the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII are also now ²³ See Hague Reports, *supra* note 14, at 543.\n²⁴ *Id.* ²⁵ Convention Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War art. 10, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2415 [hereinafter Hague XIII].\n²⁶ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 8.\n²⁷ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 5.\n²⁸ See Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 20; Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art. 28.\n²⁹ *Id.* Cyber Neutrality 75 binding on all states as customary international law.³⁰ Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency.³¹ Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states.³² However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.³³ A civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC).³⁴ However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs,³⁵ the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply.³⁶ However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”³⁷ This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.³⁸ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 In the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says: Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.³⁹ However, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”⁴⁰ ## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality In addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n### (a) United Nations Charter The post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear.⁴¹ Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war,⁴² which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.”⁴³ With nearly all sovereign ³⁹ INT’L COMM.

U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103 (June 27) [hereinafter ICJ Nicaragua Case] (establishing a difference between an armed attack and a “mere frontier incident”).\n⁴⁰ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, art. 1(2), 8 June 1977, 1125 UNTS 609 [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n⁴¹ Vagts, supra note 38, at 88-89.\n⁴² U.N.

Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require⁴⁵ all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42.⁴⁶ However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice.⁴⁷ While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights⁴⁸ held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States⁴⁹ often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war.⁵⁰ Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes,⁵¹ including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,”⁵² hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context.⁵³ Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.⁵⁴ ⁴⁴ See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n⁴⁵ U.N.

Walker, Information Warfare (b) Other Collective Security Agreements However, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members⁵⁵ of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”⁵⁶ This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”⁵⁷ By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area.⁵⁸ The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan,⁵⁹ South Korea,⁶⁰ and the Philippines⁶¹ that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.”⁶² The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting and Neutrality, 33 VAND.

Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations,⁶⁵ how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace Even though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace.⁶⁶ Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.⁶⁷ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 While the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would Cyber Neutrality 81 likely be viewed as a use of force.”⁷⁴ Koh went on to say “[a] State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof.”⁷⁵ While it is unclear to what extent the international community embraces the ability to assert self-defense rights in response to a malicious cyber activity,⁷⁶ with the United States taking an unequivocal position and NATO suggesting a similar stance,⁷⁷ others may follow.\nIt is a state’s ability to assert self-defense rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter that is so important to the neutrality analysis. If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations ⁷⁴ Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n⁷⁵ *Id.* ⁷⁶ See generally Lt Col. Patrick W. Franzese, *Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 64 A.F. L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2009).\n⁷⁷ See *Defending the Networks: The NATO Policy on Cyber Defence*, N. Atl. Treaty Org.

NATO will defend its territory and populations against all threats, including emerging security challenges such as cyber defence” and “NATO will maintain strategic ambiguity as well as flexibility on how to respond to different types of crises that include a cyber component.”).\nstressed in Hague V will still serve as distinct boundaries in the analysis. The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory.⁷⁸ In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.”⁷⁹ The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.”⁸⁰ The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.”⁸¹ The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies.⁸² The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population.⁸³ In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral ⁷⁸ Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n⁷⁹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n⁸⁰ OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n⁸² Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n⁸³ Id. at 542.\nCyber Neutrality 83 states, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming\"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the\"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\"that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term\"combatant\"makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 an individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\nCyber Neutrality 85 In order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE Meaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility The purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93 Article 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 been empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7.⁹⁶ Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”⁹⁷ Article 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁹⁸ A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor.⁹⁹ Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.”¹⁰⁰ Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group.¹⁰¹ While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged.¹⁰² The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹⁰³ However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n⁹⁶ Id. at art. 7.\n⁹⁷ Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n⁹⁸ Id. at art. 8.\n⁹⁹ Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n¹⁰⁰ Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n¹⁰¹ See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n¹⁰² Id. at 315.\n¹⁰³ Id. at 115.\nCyber Neutrality 87 in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”¹⁰⁴ The commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation.¹⁰⁵ In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters.¹⁰⁶ The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability.¹⁰⁷ Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.”¹⁰⁸ The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.”¹⁰⁹ The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities.¹¹⁰ This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.¹¹¹ ¹⁰⁴ ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n¹⁰⁵ Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n¹⁰⁶ Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n¹⁰⁷ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁸ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁹ Id. at 18.\n¹¹⁰ Id. at 18-20.\n¹¹¹ See, e.g., Scott J.

Hathaway, Rebecca Crootof, Philip Levitz, Haley Nix, Aileen Nowlan, William Perdue, Julia Spiegel, The Law of Cyber Attack, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 855 (2012).\nB. Technical and Human Attribution Attribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security.[112] A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets.[113] Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message.[114] Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.[115] One of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or\"spoofed.\"[116] While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly.[117] While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking Cyber Neutrality a response.¹¹⁸ When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.¹¹⁹ When the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies.¹²⁰ Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination.¹²¹ Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address.¹²² Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity¹²³ and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient.¹²⁴ However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message.¹²⁵ Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination.¹²⁶ Tor is a publicly available onion routing service¹²⁷ and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others.¹²⁸ Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.¹²⁹ Despite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses ¹¹⁸ Id. at 537-38.\n¹¹⁹ Id. at 537.\n¹²⁰ W.

As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest,¹³⁵ that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered.¹³⁶ According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries.¹³⁷ The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions.¹³⁸ The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems.¹³⁹ In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access.¹⁴⁰ Additionally, because the telecommunica ¹³⁰ See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n¹³¹ Id. at 39-40.\n¹³² Id. at 40.\n¹³³ Id.\n¹³⁴ David E.

Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes Even if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n## IV. CASE STUDIES While there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n¹⁴¹ Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

Estonia\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online.¹⁴⁴ In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial.¹⁴⁵ The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians.¹⁴⁶ Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks.¹⁴⁷ These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects.¹⁴⁸ While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.¹⁴⁹ Because these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force.¹⁵⁰ While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions,¹⁵¹ it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n¹⁴⁴ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n¹⁴⁵ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n¹⁴⁶ *Id.* at 15.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.* at 18-21.\n¹⁴⁸ *Id.* at 24-25.\n¹⁴⁹ *Id.* at 23.\n¹⁵⁰ Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n¹⁵¹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\nCyber Neutrality 93 Most of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS).¹⁵² This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses.¹⁵³ The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance.¹⁵⁴ Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area.¹⁵⁵ While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems,¹⁵⁶ they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights.¹⁵⁷ What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict,¹⁵⁸ exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces. However, because of the way DoS attacks work, often enslaving computers all over the world, fully applying neutrality rules to the activity of ¹⁵² Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 21.\n¹⁵³ EA-6B Prowler Mission, Description, and Specifications, Naval Air Systems Command Website, available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=C8B54023-C006-4699-BD20-9A45FBA02B9A (last visited Apr 13, 2013) [hereinafter, EA-6B Details].\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ David Axe, Secret Army Bomb Jammers Stolen in Afghanistan, WIRED, Mar. 1, 2012, available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/bomb-jammers-stolen/.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n¹⁵⁷ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n¹⁵⁸ See supra notes 70-71 and accompanying text.\nevery computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.”¹⁵⁹ If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\nB. Georgia While the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia.¹⁶⁰ On August 8, 2008, Russian military ¹⁵⁹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n¹⁶⁰ Id. at 67.\nCyber Neutrality 95 forces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military.¹⁶¹ In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war.¹⁶² Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8,¹⁶³ although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities.¹⁶⁴ While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information.¹⁶⁵ The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites.¹⁶⁶ The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website.¹⁶⁷ As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets.¹⁶⁸ However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.¹⁶⁹ Another important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites.¹⁷⁰ Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government.¹⁷¹ The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.”¹⁷² After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.¹⁷³ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 Cyber Neutrality 97 ## 2. Neutrality Analysis This conflict between Russia and Georgia raised two significant cyber neutrality issues. The first concerns the neutrality rights of Turkey while the second concerns the neutrality rights of the United States.\n### (a) Turkish Neutrality While Turkey did not formally declare itself to be a neutral in the Russian-Georgian armed conflict, which technically only lasted five days,¹⁷⁴ official Turkish statements suggested a desire to remain neutral. Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated: &gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.¹⁷⁵ These statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey,¹⁷⁶ Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral.¹⁷⁷ From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey --- ¹⁷⁴ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n¹⁷⁵ Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n¹⁷⁶ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n¹⁷⁷ Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.\nas taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities¹⁷⁸ and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action.¹⁷⁹ From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2¹⁸⁰ and Article 3¹⁸¹ could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the ¹⁷⁸ See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n¹⁷⁹ Id. at art. 52.\n¹⁸⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n¹⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\nmeaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military.¹⁸² The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n## (b) United States' Neutrality The second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral.¹⁸³ By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces”¹⁸⁴ on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.¹⁸⁵ Some might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk.¹⁸⁶ While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities.¹⁸⁷ In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.”¹⁸⁸ It goes on to say that civilians who take “part ¹⁸² For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n¹⁸³ Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n¹⁸⁴ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n¹⁸⁵ Id. at art. 5.\n¹⁸⁶ See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n¹⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n¹⁸⁸ Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8 Cyber Neutrality 99 in armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.”¹⁸⁹ Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n## C. Stuxnet The previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.",
    "## 1. Background On June 17, 2010, an employee at VirusBlokAda, a small computer security firm in Belarus, read a report from a client in Iran showing that the client’s computer was continuously rebooting.¹⁹¹ The rebooting problem indicated a potential virus and employees at VirusBlokAda soon began analyzing the system for malicious software.¹⁹² They discovered a zero-day exploit in Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer.¹⁹³ Zero-day exploits are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to its designers and they are quite rare.¹⁹⁴ Software analysis later discovered that Stuxnet took advantage of several additional Windows vulnerabilities, including additional JUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, 618 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987).": "¹⁸⁹ Id.\n¹⁹⁰ See Michael N.

Bush demanded a “third option” besides letting Iran develop a nuclear weapon or starting a war with Iran.²⁰³ Stuxnet became that third option. According to Sanger, the goal was to capitalize on Iran’s volatile centrifuge design by initiating a series of apparently random centrifuge failures, with the hope that Iranian authorities would lose faith in the design, the parts, and/or their engineers.²⁰⁴ One of Stuxnet’s most intriguing aspects was its delivery. Natanz is a secure facility that is not connected to the Internet so its designers had to figure out a way to bridge the “air gap.”²⁰⁵ According to Symantec, Stuxnet was designed to spread ¹⁹⁵ Nicolas Falliere et al., W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, Symantec Security Response 2 (Feb. 2011), available at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf [hereinafter, Stuxnet Dossier].\n¹⁹⁶ Zetter, supra note 191 (combining the file names.stub and MrxNet.sys from the software code).\n¹⁹⁷ Id.\n¹⁹⁸ Id.\n¹⁹⁹ Id.\n²⁰⁰ Id.\n²⁰¹ DAVID E.

    "## 2. Neutrality Analysis While Stuxnet did not occur during an armed conflict and therefore did not directly raise any neutrality issues, it did prove an effective operational concept that will likely be used in future conflicts. As evidenced by the Estonia and Georgia ²⁰⁶ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 2. Interestingly, the United States Department of Defense banned the use of thumb drives around this same time. See Noah Shachtman, Under Worm Assault, Military Bans Disks, USB Drives, WIRED (Nov. 19, 2008 3:12 PM), available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/army-bans-usb-d/.": "²⁰⁷ SANGER, supra 201, at 196.\n²⁰⁸ Zetter, supra note 191.\n²⁰⁹ Id.\n²¹⁰ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 21.\n²¹¹ Zetter, supra note 191.\n²¹² Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 34.\n²¹³ Id. at 6.\n²¹⁴ SANGER, supra 201, at 204-205.\n²¹⁵ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 7.\n²¹⁶ Id.\nexamples, military leaders are seemingly learning the value of effective cyber operations and will likely incorporate them into future war plans. With Stuxnet’s code now available for anyone to tinker with or modify, it is reasonable to assume that the next major international conflict will include malware similar to, or modeled after, Stuxnet. For example, industrial control systems, similar to the one used at Natanz, are found in petroleum refinement plants, chemical production plants, and electrical power generation and transmission plants.²¹⁷ It is fairly easy to imagine any of these plants as constituting a legitimate military target during a future armed conflict.\nUsing malware like Stuxnet in an armed conflict would raise at least two significant neutrality concerns: (1) the location of command and control servers and (2) delivery routes. The analysis of the command and control server issue is similar for a Stuxnet-type operation as it would be for a DoS attack but the arguments are stronger. Stuxnet used at least two different command and control servers, one in Malaysia and one in Denmark, but could have been updated throughout the operation to communicate with different command and control servers.²¹⁸ If Stuxnet had occurred during the course of an armed conflict, Malaysia and Denmark would have been in a difficult position. If Stuxnet was developed as a way to achieve effects comparable to attacking Natanz with conventional weapons,²¹⁹ it essentially substituted for conventional weapons. When military planners can use certain cyber capabilities and conventional weapons interchangeably, it defies logic to apply the neutrality rules to one and not the other.\nWith respect to Hague V, the analysis remains the same for the command and controls servers in the Stuxnet context as it does in the DoS attack context. The command and control servers in this scenario would be acting as virtual “wireless telegraphy stations” for the purpose of “communicating with belligerent forces” in violation of Article 3.²²⁰ The Stuxnet command and control servers compiled data received from each infected computer²²¹ and presumably sent that data to Stuxnet’s creators. Additionally, Stuxnet’s creators likely used the command and control servers to push updated versions of the code out to infected computers.²²² In an armed conflict scenario, it would be difficult to argue that these command and control servers are not communicating with belligerent forces. Furthermore, if malware has the ability to shut down a power grid or cripple an oil refinery, a belligerent may be more likely to respond militarily once it discovers the threat. Such a response might include damaging or disabling any known command and control servers or other ²¹⁷ SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CENTER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE SECURITY POSTURE OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (Version 1.1, Aug. 20, 2010), available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/ics/ics_fact_sheet.pdf.\n²¹⁸ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²¹⁹ SANGER, supra note 201, at 188-191.\n²²⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n²²¹ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²²² Zetter, supra note 191.\nCyber Neutrality 103 vital network elements residing in that neutral state. As the likelihood of a military response against a neutral state’s network components increases, so does the need to apply the law of neutrality in order to prevent the spread of conflict.\nThe other aspect of Stuxnet that raises potential neutrality issues concerns the specific delivery path or paths the malicious code travels. Does the law of neutrality prohibit malicious packets of information from traveling over the network infrastructure of a neutral state on the way to a belligerent target? Applying the law of neutrality to this particular scenario is problematic for two reasons. First, individual packets might not all take the same route and users may not be able to control the route.²²³ Second, applicable neutrality rules are not likely needed in this situation to prevent the spread of conflict. Put another way, the fact that some packets travel over a neutral’s network on the way to a belligerent is not likely to trigger any military action against the neutral’s network. The Internet’s redundant design means that any military action to shut down one particular route would not have much, or any, practical effect; the packets will just take a different route.²²⁴ While not a perfect fit, this narrow situation should still fall under the scope of Hague V’s telegraph exception.²²⁵ The telegraph exception was largely based on practical limitations²²⁶ that are especially applicable to controlling or monitoring the delivery routes of individual packets. Furthermore, using the roads analogy discussed earlier, it is more appropriate to view the telecommunications service provider as transporting the code in this scenario since it is the service provider who is directing the path, not the belligerent.\nWhile it may not be appropriate to apply the neutrality rules to the delivery routes of individual packets in most cases, it is important to distinguish the situation where a belligerent uses a proxy in a neutral state. While belligerents may not be able to control the specific routes packets take, a belligerent ensures the packets go through a neutral state by using a proxy in that neutral state. A belligerent may use a proxy in a neutral state in order to make it appear as if the neutral state is supporting its effort or simply because the enemy may not scrutinize Internet traffic emanating from that neutral country in the same way it scrutinizes other Internet traffic. Either way, the deliberate use of proxy in a neutral state is likely an attempt to derive some form of military advantage from a neutral’s territorial infrastructure and is prohibited.²²⁷ This essentially collapses the neutrality analysis for the delivery of packets into an intent-based analysis, an approach often advocated.²²⁸ Addition- ²²³ See Boebert, supra note 120, at 41-42.\n²²⁴ See id. at 42.\n²²⁵ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8.\n²²⁶ See Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 543.\n²²⁷ See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 1 (“The territory of neutral States is inviolable.”).\n²²⁸ See, e.g., Davis Brown, A Proposal for an International Convention to Regulate the Use of Information Systems in Armed Conflict, 47 HARV.

Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principles of Distinction and The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 ally, while there may not be much practical value in taking military action against a neutral’s network that is only carrying packets, “bricking”²²⁹ a proxy may be an effective countermeasure. Neutral states should not become cyber battle grounds for belligerents, where the burden of collateral damage would rest entirely on the neutral state.\nAs in the Georgia example, attribution limitations will not bar military action. Attribution limitations are certainly relevant, especially in conducting a proportionality analysis, but the fact remains that objects which are being used to “make an effective contribution to military action” are military objects and may be attacked.²³⁰ Every proxy computer in the chain would likely meet this definition and would therefore be subject to attack. For that matter, the cables that merely carry packets could also qualify as military, or dual-use, objects but the negligible military advantage to be gained by attacking them might be difficult to justify under a proportionality analysis.²³¹ As with the DoS attack scenario, it is technical attribution to a particular node/computer that triggers a belligerent’s ability to take military action against that particular node/computer, regardless of whether the belligerent can further attribute the conduct to a person, organization, or government.²³² ## V. CONCLUSION The neutrality rules are over a hundred years old and did not envision modern cyber capabilities but technological innovation in weaponry is nothing new. When cyber capabilities can viably substitute for conventional capabilities, whether they are damage-causing or damage-enabling capabilities, the neutrality rules must equally apply in order to preserve state sovereignty. Without applicable neutrality rules, belligerents will derive strategic advantages by purposely exploiting components of a neutral state’s infrastructure. Allowing the cyber component of the battlefield to expand to neutral states erodes a neutral state’s ability to stay out of a conflict. Belligerents do not seek symmetric responses. They constantly seek opportunities to overwhelm the enemy in the place and manner where they perceive an advantage. There is no guarantee that the cyber component of the battlefield could spread to neutral states without the conventional battlefield expanding there as well.\nAttribution remains a challenge, especially when it comes to punishing belligerents who might choose to violate a neutral state’s rights. Not only is technical attribution difficult but holding a state responsible also requires human attribution.\nNeutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1427, 1448-49 (2008).\n²²⁹ The term “bricking” refers to software or firmware changes that completely, and often permanently, disable a computer.

However, as evidenced by the Mandiant report, large, prolonged cyber operations may be difficult to conceal indefinitely. Additionally, belligerents with sophisticated cyber capabilities may also rigorously monitor and control their own networks, strengthening attribution arguments based on Corfu Channel’s rationale. Finally, while attribution certainly poses a problem in holding belligerents responsible for neutrality violations, it is less important when the neutrality rules are used to impose a duty on neutral states. Neutral states may not have the incentive to dedicate the resources necessary to monitor their own networks, but belligerents do. When a belligerent traces malicious cyber activity to components of a neutral state’s infrastructure, it should be able to require the neutral state to take appropriate action if that state wants to remain neutral.\nAs with most areas of the law, technological advances create challenges. Sometimes the law is amended to explicitly deal with new technologies and sometimes the old law is interpreted to cover (or not cover) new technologies. When it comes to cyber capabilities and the law of neutrality, gaining international consensus to amend the law may not be possible and interpreting the law to not cover cyber operations threatens the entire institution of neutrality. By interpreting the neutrality rules with a focus on their purpose, states can usher respect for neutrality into twenty-first century warfare and continue to decide for themselves if and when to enter a conflict."

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*\nWhether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War, deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race, where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities. Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace. Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility. With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.\n---\n U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n John S.

POST, Jan. 19, 2013, (available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-to-boost-cybersecurity-\nAlong with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber \"forces\" or \"weaponry\" through a neutral state?\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n## II. NEUTRALITY\nModern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.\n## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907\nThe 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically\n For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes. RODERICK OGLEY, THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 199 (1970).\n\ndirected at articulating the rights and obligations of neutral states as well as the rights and obligations of belligerents towards neutral states. Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\n1. Hague V: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.” The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1 but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.\nArticle 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.” Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.\nArticle 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.” In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\nCyber Neutrality 73\n U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para. XIII.A.1, at 35(2012) [hereinafter ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK].\n See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8 (creating a neutrality exception when using publicly available communication networks).\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n See James Brown Scott, The Reports to the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, at 539 (1917) [hereinafter Hague Reports].\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\nArticle 4 prevents belligerents from forming a “corps of combatants…on the territory of a neutral Power to assist the belligerents.” Would this prevent a belligerent from forming a botnet on the territory of a neutral that could launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on enemy command and control networks?\nArticle 5 highlights the key duty of a neutral power, namely to prevent belligerents from performing any of the actions prohibited in Articles 2 through 4. Neutral states may even be required to apply force to comply with these duties. Practically speaking, how could a neutral state prevent belligerents from using its infrastructure if belligerent cyber activities amounted to a violation of Article 2, 3, or 4?\nArticle 8 lays out an important exception when it comes to the applicability of Hague V to cyber operations. Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.” Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.” One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica-\n *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail . . .

The official report of the 1907 Hague conference states that requiring neutrals to prevent belligerents from using these lines would encounter “objections of a practical kind . . . arising out of the considerable difficulties in exercising control, not to mention the confidential character of telegraphic correspondence and the rapidity necessary to this service.” If modern technology can diminish some of those enforcement concerns, it would seem to make less sense to interpret Article 8 as sanctioning offensive cyber operations.\n## 2. Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War\nWhile Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed, while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited. Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.” Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n### 1. International Armed Conflict vs. Non-international Armed Conflict\nStrictly speaking, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII only apply to international armed conflicts (IAC) between signatory nations. While initially limited to state parties, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII are also now\n See Hague Reports, *supra* note 14, at 543.\n *Id.*\n Convention Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War art. 10, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2415 [hereinafter Hague XIII].\n Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 8.\n Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 5.\n See Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 20; Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art. 28.\n *Id.*\nCyber Neutrality 75\nbinding on all states as customary international law. Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency. Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states. However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.\nA civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC). However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs, the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply. However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nIn the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says:\nAny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.\nHowever, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”\n## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality\nIn addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n### (a) United Nations Charter\nThe post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear. Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war, which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.” With nearly all sovereign\n INT’L COMM.

Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42. However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice. While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war. Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes, including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,” hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context. Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.\n See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n U.N.

S/RES/1386 (Dec. 20, 2001) (calling on member states “participating in the International Security Assistance Force” (emphasis added)).\n See, e.g., Eric T. Jensen, Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 820 (2012); Bridgeman, supra note 30, at 1208-09; George K. Walker, Information Warfare\n\n(b) Other Collective Security Agreements\nHowever, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.” This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.” By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area. The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.” The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting\nand Neutrality, 33 VAND.

Additionally, while not officially recognizing Taiwan as an independent state, the United States has continually expressed its commitment to defend Taiwan.\nWhile the United States has collective security agreements that span the globe and appears destined for belligerency in just about any future IAC, not all states have such widespread commitments. Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations, how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace\nEven though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace. Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nWhile the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would\n\nCyber Neutrality 81\nlikely be viewed as a use of force.” Koh went on to say “[a] State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof.” While it is unclear to what extent the international community embraces the ability to assert self-defense rights in response to a malicious cyber activity, with the United States taking an unequivocal position and NATO suggesting a similar stance, others may follow.\nIt is a state’s ability to assert self-defense rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter that is so important to the neutrality analysis. If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations\n Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n *Id.*\n See generally Lt Col. Patrick W. Franzese, *Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 64 A.F. L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2009).\n See *Defending the Networks: The NATO Policy on Cyber Defence*, N. Atl. Treaty Org. (2011), available at http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_2011_09/20111004_110914-policy-cyberdefence.pdf (stating “... NATO will defend its territory and populations against all threats, including emerging security challenges such as cyber defence” and “NATO will maintain strategic ambiguity as well as flexibility on how to respond to different types of crises that include a cyber component.”).\n\nstressed in Hague V will still serve as distinct boundaries in the analysis. The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory. In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.” The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.” The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.” The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies. The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population. In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral\n Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n Id. at 542.\nCyber Neutrality 83\nstates, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming \"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the \"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\" that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term \"combatant\" makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\n\nan individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\nCyber Neutrality 85\nIn order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE\nMeaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility\nThe purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93\nArticle 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nbeen empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7. Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”\nArticle 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.” A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor. Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.” Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group. While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged. The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.” However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n Id. at art. 7.\n Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n Id. at art. 8.\n Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n Id. at 315.\n Id. at 115.\nCyber Neutrality 87\nin breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”\nThe commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation. In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters. The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability. Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.” The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.” The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities. This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.\n ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18-20.\n See, e.g., Scott J.

Hathaway, Rebecca Crootof, Philip Levitz, Haley Nix, Aileen Nowlan, William Perdue, Julia Spiegel, The Law of Cyber Attack, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 855 (2012).\n\nB. Technical and Human Attribution\nAttribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security.[112] A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets.[113] Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message.[114] Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.[115]\nOne of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or \"spoofed.\"[116] While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly.[117] While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking\nCyber Neutrality\na response. When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.\nWhen the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies. Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination. Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address. Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient. However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message. Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination. Tor is a publicly available onion routing service and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others. Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.\nDespite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses\n Id. at 537-38.\n Id. at 537.\n W. Earl Boebert, *A Survey of Challenges in Attribution*, in *COMM. ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS, NAT’L RESEARCH COUNCIL, PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY*, at 45 (2010), available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12997.html.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 46.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Clark, supra note 113, at 546.\n Id. at 542-43.\n\nregistered in China. According to the report, Chinese hackers frequently hijacked third party computers, using tools such as Remote Desktop, before hacking the target computers. However, Mandiant claims to have traced the link between the hacker and the hijacked computer in 1,905 instances from January 2011 to January 2013. The connection was traced to 832 IP addresses, 817 of which were registered in China and mainly belonged to one of four large blocks of IP addresses that service Shanghai. Chinese authorities have boisterously denied responsibility, calling Mandiant’s report “irresponsible and unprofessional.” Technical aspects alone should probably not conclusively establish an origination point. As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest, that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered. According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries. The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions. The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems. In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access. Additionally, because the telecommunica\n See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n Id. at 39-40.\n Id. at 40.\n Id.\n David E.

Under Corfu Channel, knowledge coupled with the failure to warn or take other adequate measures to prevent harm, is in itself an internationally wrongful act, regardless of who actually controls the computer.\n## C. Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes\nEven if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n## IV. CASE STUDIES\nWhile there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

Estonia\n1. Background\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online. In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial. The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians. Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks. These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects. While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.\n2. Neutrality Analysis\nBecause these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force. While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions, it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n *Id.* at 15.\n *Id.* at 18-21.\n *Id.* at 24-25.\n *Id.* at 23.\n Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\nCyber Neutrality 93\nMost of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS). This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses. The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance. Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area. While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems, they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights. What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict, exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces. However, because of the way DoS attacks work, often enslaving computers all over the world, fully applying neutrality rules to the activity of\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 21.\n EA-6B Prowler Mission, Description, and Specifications, Naval Air Systems Command Website, available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=C8B54023-C006-4699-BD20-9A45FBA02B9A (last visited Apr 13, 2013) [hereinafter, EA-6B Details].\n Id.\n David Axe, Secret Army Bomb Jammers Stolen in Afghanistan, WIRED, Mar. 1, 2012, available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/bomb-jammers-stolen/.\n Id.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n See supra notes 70-71 and accompanying text.\n\nevery computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.” If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\nB. Georgia\n1. Background\nWhile the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. On August 8, 2008, Russian military\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n Id. at 67.\nCyber Neutrality 95\nforces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military. In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war. Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8, although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities. While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information. The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites. The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website. As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets. However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.\nAnother important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites. Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government. The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.” After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nCyber Neutrality 97\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\nThis conflict between Russia and Georgia raised two significant cyber neutrality issues. The first concerns the neutrality rights of Turkey while the second concerns the neutrality rights of the United States.\n### (a) Turkish Neutrality\nWhile Turkey did not formally declare itself to be a neutral in the Russian-Georgian armed conflict, which technically only lasted five days, official Turkish statements suggested a desire to remain neutral. Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated:\n&gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.\nThese statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey, Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral. From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey\n---\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.\nas taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action. From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2 and Article 3 could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the\n See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n Id. at art. 52.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\n\nmeaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military. The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n## (b) United States' Neutrality\nThe second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral. By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces” on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.\nSome might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk. While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities. In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.” It goes on to say that civilians who take “part\n For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n Id. at art. 5.\n See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8\nCyber Neutrality 99\nin armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.” Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities. It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n## C. Stuxnet\nThe previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.\n## 1. Background\nOn June 17, 2010, an employee at VirusBlokAda, a small computer security firm in Belarus, read a report from a client in Iran showing that the client’s computer was continuously rebooting. The rebooting problem indicated a potential virus and employees at VirusBlokAda soon began analyzing the system for malicious software. They discovered a zero-day exploit in Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer. Zero-day exploits are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to its designers and they are quite rare. Software analysis later discovered that Stuxnet took advantage of several additional Windows vulnerabilities, including additional\nJUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, 618 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987).\n Id.\n See Michael N. Schmitt, The Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities: A Critical Analysis, 1 HARV. NAT’L. SEC. J. 5, 26-27 (2010).\n Kim Zetter, How Digital Detectives Deciphered Stuxnet, the Most Menacing Malware in History, WIRED, (July 11, 2011, 7), available at http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet-the-most-menacing-malware-in-history/.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nzero-day exploits. A few weeks later, VirusBlokAda employees reported the zero-day exploit and the malicious software to Microsoft, which later nicknamed the malicious code Stuxnet.\nAs software engineers worldwide began dissecting Stuxnet’s code, they discovered that it was designed to target specific industrial control software designed by Siemens, the very same software used by Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility. Other aspects of the code, such as only targeting configurations containing 164 devices and references to a specific frequency, 1064Hz, seemed to confirm Natanz as the code’s target. Once Stuxnet found its target, it was designed to do two things: 1) periodically speed up and slow down certain motors connected to a frequency converter, and 2) trick monitoring systems by replacing status reports and shutting off system alarms. This allowed Stuxnet to alter the normal operation of the industrial control system without raising operator awareness.\nIranian centrifuges, used for enriching uranium, are based off of a Pakistani design and have a reputation for being extremely temperamental, “subject to periodic, random explosion.” In David Sanger’s 2012 book, *Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power*, he says Stuxnet was a joint operation named “Olympic Games” between the United States and Israel. Sanger says Olympic Games dated back to 2006 when President George W. Bush demanded a “third option” besides letting Iran develop a nuclear weapon or starting a war with Iran. Stuxnet became that third option. According to Sanger, the goal was to capitalize on Iran’s volatile centrifuge design by initiating a series of apparently random centrifuge failures, with the hope that Iranian authorities would lose faith in the design, the parts, and/or their engineers.\nOne of Stuxnet’s most intriguing aspects was its delivery. Natanz is a secure facility that is not connected to the Internet so its designers had to figure out a way to bridge the “air gap.” According to Symantec, Stuxnet was designed to spread\n Nicolas Falliere et al., W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, Symantec Security Response 2 (Feb. 2011), available at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf [hereinafter, Stuxnet Dossier].\n Zetter, supra note 191 (combining the file names .stub and MrxNet.sys from the software code).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n DAVID E.

Stuxnet was designed to infect the computer systems of people with access to Natanz, who then might plug a laptop or a thumb drive into Natanz’s closed network. Additionally, each time Stuxnet infected a computer it would gather some basic information about the system, such as the machine’s internal and external IP addresses, its name, details about the operating system, and whether it contained Siemens industrial control software. Stuxnet would then report this information to a central command and control server attached to one or more domain names. Symantec identified two of these command and control servers, one in Denmark and one in Malaysia. The command and control servers could directly install updated versions of Stuxnet or other files on infected machines. Additionally, infected computers continuously searched LANs or connected devices for updated versions of the code. This meant that so long as Natanz insiders kept connecting thumb drives and laptops to both open and closed networks, updated versions of Stuxnet would eventually infect all targeted systems.\nWhile Stuxnet eventually spread to 155 different countries (as a result of an unintended programming mistake), Symantec says it was initially targeted at five different organizations, all with a “presence in Iran”. Interestingly, the shortest time between the software compile time and initial infection time was 12 hours. Such a short time between when the code was completed to when it infected a machine with an “Iranian presence” suggests that the code was initially delivered via the Internet as opposed to being covertly installed by hand.\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\nWhile Stuxnet did not occur during an armed conflict and therefore did not directly raise any neutrality issues, it did prove an effective operational concept that will likely be used in future conflicts. As evidenced by the Estonia and Georgia\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 2. Interestingly, the United States Department of Defense banned the use of thumb drives around this same time. See Noah Shachtman, Under Worm Assault, Military Bans Disks, USB Drives, WIRED (Nov. 19, 2008 3:12 PM), available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/army-bans-usb-d/.\n SANGER, supra 201, at 196.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\n Id.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 21.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 34.\n Id. at 6.\n SANGER, supra 201, at 204-205.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 7.\n Id.\n\nexamples, military leaders are seemingly learning the value of effective cyber operations and will likely incorporate them into future war plans. With Stuxnet’s code now available for anyone to tinker with or modify, it is reasonable to assume that the next major international conflict will include malware similar to, or modeled after, Stuxnet. For example, industrial control systems, similar to the one used at Natanz, are found in petroleum refinement plants, chemical production plants, and electrical power generation and transmission plants. It is fairly easy to imagine any of these plants as constituting a legitimate military target during a future armed conflict.\nUsing malware like Stuxnet in an armed conflict would raise at least two significant neutrality concerns: (1) the location of command and control servers and (2) delivery routes. The analysis of the command and control server issue is similar for a Stuxnet-type operation as it would be for a DoS attack but the arguments are stronger. Stuxnet used at least two different command and control servers, one in Malaysia and one in Denmark, but could have been updated throughout the operation to communicate with different command and control servers. If Stuxnet had occurred during the course of an armed conflict, Malaysia and Denmark would have been in a difficult position. If Stuxnet was developed as a way to achieve effects comparable to attacking Natanz with conventional weapons, it essentially substituted for conventional weapons. When military planners can use certain cyber capabilities and conventional weapons interchangeably, it defies logic to apply the neutrality rules to one and not the other.\nWith respect to Hague V, the analysis remains the same for the command and controls servers in the Stuxnet context as it does in the DoS attack context. The command and control servers in this scenario would be acting as virtual “wireless telegraphy stations” for the purpose of “communicating with belligerent forces” in violation of Article 3. The Stuxnet command and control servers compiled data received from each infected computer and presumably sent that data to Stuxnet’s creators. Additionally, Stuxnet’s creators likely used the command and control servers to push updated versions of the code out to infected computers. In an armed conflict scenario, it would be difficult to argue that these command and control servers are not communicating with belligerent forces. Furthermore, if malware has the ability to shut down a power grid or cripple an oil refinery, a belligerent may be more likely to respond militarily once it discovers the threat. Such a response might include damaging or disabling any known command and control servers or other\n SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CENTER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE SECURITY POSTURE OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (Version 1.1, Aug. 20, 2010), available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/ics/ics_fact_sheet.pdf.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n SANGER, supra note 201, at 188-191.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\nCyber Neutrality 103\nvital network elements residing in that neutral state. As the likelihood of a military response against a neutral state’s network components increases, so does the need to apply the law of neutrality in order to prevent the spread of conflict.\nThe other aspect of Stuxnet that raises potential neutrality issues concerns the specific delivery path or paths the malicious code travels. Does the law of neutrality prohibit malicious packets of information from traveling over the network infrastructure of a neutral state on the way to a belligerent target? Applying the law of neutrality to this particular scenario is problematic for two reasons. First, individual packets might not all take the same route and users may not be able to control the route. Second, applicable neutrality rules are not likely needed in this situation to prevent the spread of conflict. Put another way, the fact that some packets travel over a neutral’s network on the way to a belligerent is not likely to trigger any military action against the neutral’s network. The Internet’s redundant design means that any military action to shut down one particular route would not have much, or any, practical effect; the packets will just take a different route. While not a perfect fit, this narrow situation should still fall under the scope of Hague V’s telegraph exception. The telegraph exception was largely based on practical limitations that are especially applicable to controlling or monitoring the delivery routes of individual packets. Furthermore, using the roads analogy discussed earlier, it is more appropriate to view the telecommunications service provider as transporting the code in this scenario since it is the service provider who is directing the path, not the belligerent.\nWhile it may not be appropriate to apply the neutrality rules to the delivery routes of individual packets in most cases, it is important to distinguish the situation where a belligerent uses a proxy in a neutral state. While belligerents may not be able to control the specific routes packets take, a belligerent ensures the packets go through a neutral state by using a proxy in that neutral state. A belligerent may use a proxy in a neutral state in order to make it appear as if the neutral state is supporting its effort or simply because the enemy may not scrutinize Internet traffic emanating from that neutral country in the same way it scrutinizes other Internet traffic. Either way, the deliberate use of proxy in a neutral state is likely an attempt to derive some form of military advantage from a neutral’s territorial infrastructure and is prohibited. This essentially collapses the neutrality analysis for the delivery of packets into an intent-based analysis, an approach often advocated.

Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principles of Distinction and\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nally, while there may not be much practical value in taking military action against a neutral’s network that is only carrying packets, “bricking” a proxy may be an effective countermeasure. Neutral states should not become cyber battle grounds for belligerents, where the burden of collateral damage would rest entirely on the neutral state.\nAs in the Georgia example, attribution limitations will not bar military action. Attribution limitations are certainly relevant, especially in conducting a proportionality analysis, but the fact remains that objects which are being used to “make an effective contribution to military action” are military objects and may be attacked. Every proxy computer in the chain would likely meet this definition and would therefore be subject to attack. For that matter, the cables that merely carry packets could also qualify as military, or dual-use, objects but the negligible military advantage to be gained by attacking them might be difficult to justify under a proportionality analysis. As with the DoS attack scenario, it is technical attribution to a particular node/computer that triggers a belligerent’s ability to take military action against that particular node/computer, regardless of whether the belligerent can further attribute the conduct to a person, organization, or government.\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe neutrality rules are over a hundred years old and did not envision modern cyber capabilities but technological innovation in weaponry is nothing new. When cyber capabilities can viably substitute for conventional capabilities, whether they are damage-causing or damage-enabling capabilities, the neutrality rules must equally apply in order to preserve state sovereignty. Without applicable neutrality rules, belligerents will derive strategic advantages by purposely exploiting components of a neutral state’s infrastructure. Allowing the cyber component of the battlefield to expand to neutral states erodes a neutral state’s ability to stay out of a conflict. Belligerents do not seek symmetric responses. They constantly seek opportunities to overwhelm the enemy in the place and manner where they perceive an advantage. There is no guarantee that the cyber component of the battlefield could spread to neutral states without the conventional battlefield expanding there as well.\nAttribution remains a challenge, especially when it comes to punishing belligerents who might choose to violate a neutral state’s rights. Not only is technical attribution difficult but holding a state responsible also requires human attribution.\nNeutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1427, 1448-49 (2008).\n The term “bricking” refers to software or firmware changes that completely, and often permanently, disable a computer. See John Haubenreich, The iPhone and the DMCA: Locking the Hands of Customers, 61 VAND. L. REV. 1507, 1538, n.201 (2008).\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 52.\n Id. at art. 51.\n See supra notes 178-179 and accompanying text.\nCyber Neutrality 105\nThese attribution challenges may limit the deterrent value of applying the neutrality rules to cyber operations. However, as evidenced by the Mandiant report, large, prolonged cyber operations may be difficult to conceal indefinitely. Additionally, belligerents with sophisticated cyber capabilities may also rigorously monitor and control their own networks, strengthening attribution arguments based on Corfu Channel’s rationale. Finally, while attribution certainly poses a problem in holding belligerents responsible for neutrality violations, it is less important when the neutrality rules are used to impose a duty on neutral states. Neutral states may not have the incentive to dedicate the resources necessary to monitor their own networks, but belligerents do. When a belligerent traces malicious cyber activity to components of a neutral state’s infrastructure, it should be able to require the neutral state to take appropriate action if that state wants to remain neutral.\nAs with most areas of the law, technological advances create challenges. Sometimes the law is amended to explicitly deal with new technologies and sometimes the old law is interpreted to cover (or not cover) new technologies. When it comes to cyber capabilities and the law of neutrality, gaining international consensus to amend the law may not be possible and interpreting the law to not cover cyber operations threatens the entire institution of neutrality. By interpreting the neutrality rules with a focus on their purpose, states can usher respect for neutrality into twenty-first century warfare and continue to decide for themselves if and when to enter a conflict.",

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*\nWhether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War, deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race, where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities. Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace. Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility. With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.\n---\n U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n John S.

POST, Jan. 19, 2013, (available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-to-boost-cybersecurity-\nAlong with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber \"forces\" or \"weaponry\" through a neutral state?\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n## II. NEUTRALITY\nModern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.\n## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907\nThe 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically\n For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes. RODERICK OGLEY, THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 199 (1970).\n\ndirected at articulating the rights and obligations of neutral states as well as the rights and obligations of belligerents towards neutral states. Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\n1. Hague V: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.” The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1 but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.\nArticle 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.” Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.\nArticle 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.” In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\nCyber Neutrality 73\n U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para.

Neutral states may even be required to apply force to comply with these duties. Practically speaking, how could a neutral state prevent belligerents from using its infrastructure if belligerent cyber activities amounted to a violation of Article 2, 3, or 4?\nArticle 8 lays out an important exception when it comes to the applicability of Hague V to cyber operations. Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.” While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.” Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.” One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica-\n *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail . . .

The official report of the 1907 Hague conference states that requiring neutrals to prevent belligerents from using these lines would encounter “objections of a practical kind . . . arising out of the considerable difficulties in exercising control, not to mention the confidential character of telegraphic correspondence and the rapidity necessary to this service.” If modern technology can diminish some of those enforcement concerns, it would seem to make less sense to interpret Article 8 as sanctioning offensive cyber operations.\n## 2. Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War\nWhile Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed, while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited. Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.” Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n### 1. International Armed Conflict vs. Non-international Armed Conflict\nStrictly speaking, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII only apply to international armed conflicts (IAC) between signatory nations. While initially limited to state parties, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII are also now\n See Hague Reports, *supra* note 14, at 543.\n *Id.*\n Convention Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War art. 10, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2415 [hereinafter Hague XIII].\n Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 8.\n Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 5.\n See Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 20; Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art. 28.\n *Id.*\nCyber Neutrality 75\nbinding on all states as customary international law. Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency. Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states. However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.\nA civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC). However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs, the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply. However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nIn the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says:\nAny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.\nHowever, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”\n## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality\nIn addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n### (a) United Nations Charter\nThe post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear. Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war, which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.” With nearly all sovereign\n INT’L COMM.

Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42. However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice. While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war. Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes, including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,” hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context. Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.\n See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n U.N.

Walker, Information Warfare\n\n(b) Other Collective Security Agreements\nHowever, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.” This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.” By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area. The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.” The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting\nand Neutrality, 33 VAND.

Additionally, while not officially recognizing Taiwan as an independent state, the United States has continually expressed its commitment to defend Taiwan.\nWhile the United States has collective security agreements that span the globe and appears destined for belligerency in just about any future IAC, not all states have such widespread commitments. Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations, how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace\nEven though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace. Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nWhile the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would\n\nCyber Neutrality 81\nlikely be viewed as a use of force.” Koh went on to say “[a] State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof.” While it is unclear to what extent the international community embraces the ability to assert self-defense rights in response to a malicious cyber activity, with the United States taking an unequivocal position and NATO suggesting a similar stance, others may follow.\nIt is a state’s ability to assert self-defense rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter that is so important to the neutrality analysis. If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations\n Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n *Id.*\n See generally Lt Col. Patrick W. Franzese, *Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 64 A.F. L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2009).\n See *Defending the Networks: The NATO Policy on Cyber Defence*, N. Atl. Treaty Org.

NATO will defend its territory and populations against all threats, including emerging security challenges such as cyber defence” and “NATO will maintain strategic ambiguity as well as flexibility on how to respond to different types of crises that include a cyber component.”).\n\nstressed in Hague V will still serve as distinct boundaries in the analysis. The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory. In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.” The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.” The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.” The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies. The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population. In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral\n Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n Id. at 542.\nCyber Neutrality 83\nstates, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming \"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the \"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\" that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term \"combatant\" makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\n\nan individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\nCyber Neutrality 85\nIn order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE\nMeaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility\nThe purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93\nArticle 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nbeen empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7. Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”\nArticle 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.” A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor. Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.” Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group. While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged. The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.” However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n Id. at art. 7.\n Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n Id. at art. 8.\n Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n Id. at 315.\n Id. at 115.\nCyber Neutrality 87\nin breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”\nThe commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation. In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters. The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability. Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.” The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.” The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities. This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.\n ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18.\n Id. at 18-20.\n See, e.g., Scott J. Shackleford and Richard B. Andres, State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks: Competing Standards for a Growing Problem, 42 GEO J. INT’L L. 971, 989 (2011); Oona A. Hathaway, Rebecca Crootof, Philip Levitz, Haley Nix, Aileen Nowlan, William Perdue, Julia Spiegel, The Law of Cyber Attack, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 855 (2012).\n\nB. Technical and Human Attribution\nAttribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security.[112] A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets.[113] Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message.[114] Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.[115]\nOne of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or \"spoofed.\"[116] While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly.[117] While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking\nCyber Neutrality\na response. When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.\nWhen the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies. Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination. Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address. Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient. However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message. Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination. Tor is a publicly available onion routing service and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others. Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.\nDespite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses\n Id. at 537-38.\n Id. at 537.\n W. Earl Boebert, *A Survey of Challenges in Attribution*, in *COMM. ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS, NAT’L RESEARCH COUNCIL, PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY*, at 45 (2010), available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12997.html.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 46.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Clark, supra note 113, at 546.\n Id. at 542-43.\n\nregistered in China. According to the report, Chinese hackers frequently hijacked third party computers, using tools such as Remote Desktop, before hacking the target computers. However, Mandiant claims to have traced the link between the hacker and the hijacked computer in 1,905 instances from January 2011 to January 2013. The connection was traced to 832 IP addresses, 817 of which were registered in China and mainly belonged to one of four large blocks of IP addresses that service Shanghai. Chinese authorities have boisterously denied responsibility, calling Mandiant’s report “irresponsible and unprofessional.” Technical aspects alone should probably not conclusively establish an origination point. As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest, that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered. According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries. The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions. The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems. In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access. Additionally, because the telecommunica\n See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n Id. at 39-40.\n Id. at 40.\n Id.\n David E.

Under Corfu Channel, knowledge coupled with the failure to warn or take other adequate measures to prevent harm, is in itself an internationally wrongful act, regardless of who actually controls the computer.\n## C. Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes\nEven if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n## IV. CASE STUDIES\nWhile there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

Estonia\n1. Background\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online. In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial. The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians. Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks. These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects. While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.\n2. Neutrality Analysis\nBecause these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force. While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions, it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n *Id.* at 15.\n *Id.* at 18-21.\n *Id.* at 24-25.\n *Id.* at 23.\n Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\nCyber Neutrality 93\nMost of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS). This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses. The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance. Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area. While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems, they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights. What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict, exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces. However, because of the way DoS attacks work, often enslaving computers all over the world, fully applying neutrality rules to the activity of\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 21.\n EA-6B Prowler Mission, Description, and Specifications, Naval Air Systems Command Website, available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=C8B54023-C006-4699-BD20-9A45FBA02B9A (last visited Apr 13, 2013) [hereinafter, EA-6B Details].\n Id.\n David Axe, Secret Army Bomb Jammers Stolen in Afghanistan, WIRED, Mar. 1, 2012, available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/bomb-jammers-stolen/.\n Id.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n See supra notes 70-71 and accompanying text.\n\nevery computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.” If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\nB. Georgia\n1. Background\nWhile the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia. On August 8, 2008, Russian military\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n Id. at 67.\nCyber Neutrality 95\nforces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military. In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war. Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8, although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities. While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information. The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites. The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website. As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets. However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.\nAnother important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites. Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government. The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.” After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nCyber Neutrality 97\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\nThis conflict between Russia and Georgia raised two significant cyber neutrality issues. The first concerns the neutrality rights of Turkey while the second concerns the neutrality rights of the United States.\n### (a) Turkish Neutrality\nWhile Turkey did not formally declare itself to be a neutral in the Russian-Georgian armed conflict, which technically only lasted five days, official Turkish statements suggested a desire to remain neutral. Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated:\n&gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.\nThese statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey, Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral. From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey\n---\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.\nas taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action. From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2 and Article 3 could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the\n See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n Id. at art. 52.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\n\nmeaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military. The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n## (b) United States' Neutrality\nThe second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral. By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces” on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.\nSome might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk. While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities. In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.” It goes on to say that civilians who take “part\n For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n Id. at art. 5.\n See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8\nCyber Neutrality 99\nin armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.” Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities. It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n## C. Stuxnet\nThe previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.\n## 1. Background\nOn June 17, 2010, an employee at VirusBlokAda, a small computer security firm in Belarus, read a report from a client in Iran showing that the client’s computer was continuously rebooting. The rebooting problem indicated a potential virus and employees at VirusBlokAda soon began analyzing the system for malicious software. They discovered a zero-day exploit in Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer. Zero-day exploits are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to its designers and they are quite rare. Software analysis later discovered that Stuxnet took advantage of several additional Windows vulnerabilities, including additional\nJUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, 618 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987).\n Id.\n See Michael N. Schmitt, The Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities: A Critical Analysis, 1 HARV. NAT’L. SEC. J. 5, 26-27 (2010).\n Kim Zetter, How Digital Detectives Deciphered Stuxnet, the Most Menacing Malware in History, WIRED, (July 11, 2011, 7), available at http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet-the-most-menacing-malware-in-history/.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nzero-day exploits. A few weeks later, VirusBlokAda employees reported the zero-day exploit and the malicious software to Microsoft, which later nicknamed the malicious code Stuxnet.\nAs software engineers worldwide began dissecting Stuxnet’s code, they discovered that it was designed to target specific industrial control software designed by Siemens, the very same software used by Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility. Other aspects of the code, such as only targeting configurations containing 164 devices and references to a specific frequency, 1064Hz, seemed to confirm Natanz as the code’s target. Once Stuxnet found its target, it was designed to do two things: 1) periodically speed up and slow down certain motors connected to a frequency converter, and 2) trick monitoring systems by replacing status reports and shutting off system alarms. This allowed Stuxnet to alter the normal operation of the industrial control system without raising operator awareness.\nIranian centrifuges, used for enriching uranium, are based off of a Pakistani design and have a reputation for being extremely temperamental, “subject to periodic, random explosion.” In David Sanger’s 2012 book, *Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power*, he says Stuxnet was a joint operation named “Olympic Games” between the United States and Israel. Sanger says Olympic Games dated back to 2006 when President George W. Bush demanded a “third option” besides letting Iran develop a nuclear weapon or starting a war with Iran. Stuxnet became that third option. According to Sanger, the goal was to capitalize on Iran’s volatile centrifuge design by initiating a series of apparently random centrifuge failures, with the hope that Iranian authorities would lose faith in the design, the parts, and/or their engineers.\nOne of Stuxnet’s most intriguing aspects was its delivery. Natanz is a secure facility that is not connected to the Internet so its designers had to figure out a way to bridge the “air gap.” According to Symantec, Stuxnet was designed to spread\n Nicolas Falliere et al., W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, Symantec Security Response 2 (Feb. 2011), available at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf [hereinafter, Stuxnet Dossier].\n Zetter, supra note 191 (combining the file names .stub and MrxNet.sys from the software code).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n DAVID E.

Stuxnet was designed to infect the computer systems of people with access to Natanz, who then might plug a laptop or a thumb drive into Natanz’s closed network. Additionally, each time Stuxnet infected a computer it would gather some basic information about the system, such as the machine’s internal and external IP addresses, its name, details about the operating system, and whether it contained Siemens industrial control software. Stuxnet would then report this information to a central command and control server attached to one or more domain names. Symantec identified two of these command and control servers, one in Denmark and one in Malaysia. The command and control servers could directly install updated versions of Stuxnet or other files on infected machines. Additionally, infected computers continuously searched LANs or connected devices for updated versions of the code. This meant that so long as Natanz insiders kept connecting thumb drives and laptops to both open and closed networks, updated versions of Stuxnet would eventually infect all targeted systems.\nWhile Stuxnet eventually spread to 155 different countries (as a result of an unintended programming mistake), Symantec says it was initially targeted at five different organizations, all with a “presence in Iran”. Interestingly, the shortest time between the software compile time and initial infection time was 12 hours. Such a short time between when the code was completed to when it infected a machine with an “Iranian presence” suggests that the code was initially delivered via the Internet as opposed to being covertly installed by hand.\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\nWhile Stuxnet did not occur during an armed conflict and therefore did not directly raise any neutrality issues, it did prove an effective operational concept that will likely be used in future conflicts. As evidenced by the Estonia and Georgia\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 2. Interestingly, the United States Department of Defense banned the use of thumb drives around this same time. See Noah Shachtman, Under Worm Assault, Military Bans Disks, USB Drives, WIRED (Nov. 19, 2008 3:12 PM), available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/army-bans-usb-d/.\n SANGER, supra 201, at 196.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\n Id.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 21.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 34.\n Id. at 6.\n SANGER, supra 201, at 204-205.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 7.\n Id.\n\nexamples, military leaders are seemingly learning the value of effective cyber operations and will likely incorporate them into future war plans. With Stuxnet’s code now available for anyone to tinker with or modify, it is reasonable to assume that the next major international conflict will include malware similar to, or modeled after, Stuxnet. For example, industrial control systems, similar to the one used at Natanz, are found in petroleum refinement plants, chemical production plants, and electrical power generation and transmission plants. It is fairly easy to imagine any of these plants as constituting a legitimate military target during a future armed conflict.\nUsing malware like Stuxnet in an armed conflict would raise at least two significant neutrality concerns: (1) the location of command and control servers and (2) delivery routes. The analysis of the command and control server issue is similar for a Stuxnet-type operation as it would be for a DoS attack but the arguments are stronger. Stuxnet used at least two different command and control servers, one in Malaysia and one in Denmark, but could have been updated throughout the operation to communicate with different command and control servers. If Stuxnet had occurred during the course of an armed conflict, Malaysia and Denmark would have been in a difficult position. If Stuxnet was developed as a way to achieve effects comparable to attacking Natanz with conventional weapons, it essentially substituted for conventional weapons. When military planners can use certain cyber capabilities and conventional weapons interchangeably, it defies logic to apply the neutrality rules to one and not the other.\nWith respect to Hague V, the analysis remains the same for the command and controls servers in the Stuxnet context as it does in the DoS attack context. The command and control servers in this scenario would be acting as virtual “wireless telegraphy stations” for the purpose of “communicating with belligerent forces” in violation of Article 3. The Stuxnet command and control servers compiled data received from each infected computer and presumably sent that data to Stuxnet’s creators. Additionally, Stuxnet’s creators likely used the command and control servers to push updated versions of the code out to infected computers. In an armed conflict scenario, it would be difficult to argue that these command and control servers are not communicating with belligerent forces. Furthermore, if malware has the ability to shut down a power grid or cripple an oil refinery, a belligerent may be more likely to respond militarily once it discovers the threat. Such a response might include damaging or disabling any known command and control servers or other\n SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CENTER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE SECURITY POSTURE OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (Version 1.1, Aug. 20, 2010), available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/ics/ics_fact_sheet.pdf.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n SANGER, supra note 201, at 188-191.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n Zetter, supra note 191.\nCyber Neutrality 103\nvital network elements residing in that neutral state. As the likelihood of a military response against a neutral state’s network components increases, so does the need to apply the law of neutrality in order to prevent the spread of conflict.\nThe other aspect of Stuxnet that raises potential neutrality issues concerns the specific delivery path or paths the malicious code travels. Does the law of neutrality prohibit malicious packets of information from traveling over the network infrastructure of a neutral state on the way to a belligerent target? Applying the law of neutrality to this particular scenario is problematic for two reasons. First, individual packets might not all take the same route and users may not be able to control the route. Second, applicable neutrality rules are not likely needed in this situation to prevent the spread of conflict. Put another way, the fact that some packets travel over a neutral’s network on the way to a belligerent is not likely to trigger any military action against the neutral’s network. The Internet’s redundant design means that any military action to shut down one particular route would not have much, or any, practical effect; the packets will just take a different route. While not a perfect fit, this narrow situation should still fall under the scope of Hague V’s telegraph exception. The telegraph exception was largely based on practical limitations that are especially applicable to controlling or monitoring the delivery routes of individual packets. Furthermore, using the roads analogy discussed earlier, it is more appropriate to view the telecommunications service provider as transporting the code in this scenario since it is the service provider who is directing the path, not the belligerent.\nWhile it may not be appropriate to apply the neutrality rules to the delivery routes of individual packets in most cases, it is important to distinguish the situation where a belligerent uses a proxy in a neutral state. While belligerents may not be able to control the specific routes packets take, a belligerent ensures the packets go through a neutral state by using a proxy in that neutral state. A belligerent may use a proxy in a neutral state in order to make it appear as if the neutral state is supporting its effort or simply because the enemy may not scrutinize Internet traffic emanating from that neutral country in the same way it scrutinizes other Internet traffic. Either way, the deliberate use of proxy in a neutral state is likely an attempt to derive some form of military advantage from a neutral’s territorial infrastructure and is prohibited. This essentially collapses the neutrality analysis for the delivery of packets into an intent-based analysis, an approach often advocated. Addition-\n See Boebert, supra note 120, at 41-42.\n See id. at 42.\n Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8.\n See Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 543.\n See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 1 (“The territory of neutral States is inviolable.”).\n See, e.g., Davis Brown, A Proposal for an International Convention to Regulate the Use of Information Systems in Armed Conflict, 47 HARV.

Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principles of Distinction and\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nally, while there may not be much practical value in taking military action against a neutral’s network that is only carrying packets, “bricking” a proxy may be an effective countermeasure. Neutral states should not become cyber battle grounds for belligerents, where the burden of collateral damage would rest entirely on the neutral state.\nAs in the Georgia example, attribution limitations will not bar military action. Attribution limitations are certainly relevant, especially in conducting a proportionality analysis, but the fact remains that objects which are being used to “make an effective contribution to military action” are military objects and may be attacked. Every proxy computer in the chain would likely meet this definition and would therefore be subject to attack. For that matter, the cables that merely carry packets could also qualify as military, or dual-use, objects but the negligible military advantage to be gained by attacking them might be difficult to justify under a proportionality analysis. As with the DoS attack scenario, it is technical attribution to a particular node/computer that triggers a belligerent’s ability to take military action against that particular node/computer, regardless of whether the belligerent can further attribute the conduct to a person, organization, or government.\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe neutrality rules are over a hundred years old and did not envision modern cyber capabilities but technological innovation in weaponry is nothing new. When cyber capabilities can viably substitute for conventional capabilities, whether they are damage-causing or damage-enabling capabilities, the neutrality rules must equally apply in order to preserve state sovereignty. Without applicable neutrality rules, belligerents will derive strategic advantages by purposely exploiting components of a neutral state’s infrastructure. Allowing the cyber component of the battlefield to expand to neutral states erodes a neutral state’s ability to stay out of a conflict. Belligerents do not seek symmetric responses. They constantly seek opportunities to overwhelm the enemy in the place and manner where they perceive an advantage. There is no guarantee that the cyber component of the battlefield could spread to neutral states without the conventional battlefield expanding there as well.\nAttribution remains a challenge, especially when it comes to punishing belligerents who might choose to violate a neutral state’s rights. Not only is technical attribution difficult but holding a state responsible also requires human attribution.\nNeutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1427, 1448-49 (2008).\n The term “bricking” refers to software or firmware changes that completely, and often permanently, disable a computer. See John Haubenreich, The iPhone and the DMCA: Locking the Hands of Customers, 61 VAND. L. REV. 1507, 1538, n.201 (2008).\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 52.\n Id. at art. 51.\n See supra notes 178-179 and accompanying text.\nCyber Neutrality 105\nThese attribution challenges may limit the deterrent value of applying the neutrality rules to cyber operations. However, as evidenced by the Mandiant report, large, prolonged cyber operations may be difficult to conceal indefinitely. Additionally, belligerents with sophisticated cyber capabilities may also rigorously monitor and control their own networks, strengthening attribution arguments based on Corfu Channel’s rationale. Finally, while attribution certainly poses a problem in holding belligerents responsible for neutrality violations, it is less important when the neutrality rules are used to impose a duty on neutral states. Neutral states may not have the incentive to dedicate the resources necessary to monitor their own networks, but belligerents do. When a belligerent traces malicious cyber activity to components of a neutral state’s infrastructure, it should be able to require the neutral state to take appropriate action if that state wants to remain neutral.\nAs with most areas of the law, technological advances create challenges. Sometimes the law is amended to explicitly deal with new technologies and sometimes the old law is interpreted to cover (or not cover) new technologies. When it comes to cyber capabilities and the law of neutrality, gaining international consensus to amend the law may not be possible and interpreting the law to not cover cyber operations threatens the entire institution of neutrality. By interpreting the neutrality rules with a focus on their purpose, states can usher respect for neutrality into twenty-first century warfare and continue to decide for themselves if and when to enter a conflict."

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*\nWhether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II¹ or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War,² deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race,³ where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities.⁴ Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace.⁵ Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility.⁶ With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.⁷\n---\n¹ U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n² John S.

POST, Jan. 19, 2013, (available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-to-boost-cybersecurity-\nAlong with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber \"forces\" or \"weaponry\" through a neutral state?\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n## II. NEUTRALITY\nModern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.⁸\n## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907\nThe 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically\n⁸ For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes.

Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today⁹ and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\n1. Hague V: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.”¹⁰ The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1¹¹ but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.¹²\nArticle 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”¹³ Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.¹⁴\nArticle 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”¹⁵ In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\nCyber Neutrality 73\n⁹ U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n¹⁰ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n¹¹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para.

Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.”²⁰ While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.”²¹ Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.”²² One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica-\n¹⁶ *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n¹⁷ “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail . . .

Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War\nWhile Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed,²⁵ while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited.²⁶ Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.”²⁷ Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n### 1. International Armed Conflict vs. Non-international Armed Conflict\nStrictly speaking, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII only apply to international armed conflicts (IAC) between signatory nations.²⁸ While initially limited to state parties,²⁹ the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII are also now\n²³ See Hague Reports, *supra* note 14, at 543.\n²⁴ *Id.*\n²⁵ Convention Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War art. 10, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2415 [hereinafter Hague XIII].\n²⁶ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 8.\n²⁷ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 5.\n²⁸ See Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 20; Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art. 28.\n²⁹ *Id.*\nCyber Neutrality 75\nbinding on all states as customary international law.³⁰ Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency.³¹ Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states.³² However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.³³\nA civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC).³⁴ However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs,³⁵ the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply.³⁶ However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”³⁷ This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.³⁸\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nIn the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says:\nAny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.³⁹\nHowever, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”⁴⁰\n## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality\nIn addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n### (a) United Nations Charter\nThe post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear.⁴¹ Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war,⁴² which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.”⁴³ With nearly all sovereign\n³⁹ INT’L COMM.

Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require⁴⁵ all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42.⁴⁶ However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice.⁴⁷ While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights⁴⁸ held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States⁴⁹ often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war.⁵⁰ Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes,⁵¹ including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,”⁵² hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context.⁵³ Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.⁵⁴\n⁴⁴ See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n⁴⁵ U.N.

Walker, Information Warfare\n78 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\n(b) Other Collective Security Agreements\nHowever, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members⁵⁵ of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”⁵⁶ This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”⁵⁷ By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area.⁵⁸ The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan,⁵⁹ South Korea,⁶⁰ and the Philippines⁶¹ that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.”⁶² The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting\nand Neutrality, 33 VAND.

Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations,⁶⁵ how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace\nEven though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace.⁶⁶ Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.⁶⁷\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nWhile the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would\n88 (July 8) (“The Court finds that as in the case of the principles of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict, international law leaves no doubt that the principle of neutrality, whatever its content, which is of a fundamental character similar to that of the humanitarian principles and rules, is applicable (subject to the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter), to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used.”).\n68 See Hague V, supra note 10, Preamble.\n69 See Hague XIII, supra note 25, Preamble.\n70 Georgios C.

REV. 569, 575-76 (2011).\nCyber Neutrality 81\nlikely be viewed as a use of force.”⁷⁴ Koh went on to say “[a] State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof.”⁷⁵ While it is unclear to what extent the international community embraces the ability to assert self-defense rights in response to a malicious cyber activity,⁷⁶ with the United States taking an unequivocal position and NATO suggesting a similar stance,⁷⁷ others may follow.\nIt is a state’s ability to assert self-defense rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter that is so important to the neutrality analysis. If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations\n⁷⁴ Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n⁷⁵ *Id.*\n⁷⁶ See generally Lt Col. Patrick W.

The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory.⁷⁸ In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.”⁷⁹ The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.”⁸⁰ The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.”⁸¹ The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies.⁸² The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population.⁸³ In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral\n⁷⁸ Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n⁷⁹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n⁸⁰ OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n⁸² Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n⁸³ Id. at 542.\nCyber Neutrality 83\nstates, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming \"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the \"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\" that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term \"combatant\" makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\n84 Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n85 Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 540.\n86 ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 11, Ch. 2 para.

II.C.3.b.(5), at 135.\n88 Hague V, supra note 10, art. 4.\n89 A neutral state is not obligated to prohibit its nationals from crossing the border and offering assistance to a belligerent. Hague V, supra note 10, art. 6.\nan individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\nCyber Neutrality 85\nIn order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE\nMeaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility\nThe purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93\nArticle 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nbeen empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7.⁹⁶ Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”⁹⁷\nArticle 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁹⁸ A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor.⁹⁹ Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.”¹⁰⁰ Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group.¹⁰¹ While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged.¹⁰² The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹⁰³ However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n⁹⁶ Id. at art. 7.\n⁹⁷ Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n⁹⁸ Id. at art. 8.\n⁹⁹ Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n¹⁰⁰ Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n¹⁰¹ See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n¹⁰² Id. at 315.\n¹⁰³ Id. at 115.\nCyber Neutrality 87\nin breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”¹⁰⁴\nThe commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation.¹⁰⁵ In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters.¹⁰⁶ The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability.¹⁰⁷ Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.”¹⁰⁸ The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.”¹⁰⁹ The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities.¹¹⁰ This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.¹¹¹\n¹⁰⁴ ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n¹⁰⁵ Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n¹⁰⁶ Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n¹⁰⁷ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁸ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁹ Id. at 18.\n¹¹⁰ Id. at 18-20.\n¹¹¹ See, e.g., Scott J.

REV. 817, 855 (2012).\n88 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nB. Technical and Human Attribution\nAttribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security. A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets. Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message. Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.\nOne of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or \"spoofed.\" While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly. While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking\nCyber Neutrality\na response.¹¹⁸ When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.¹¹⁹\nWhen the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies.¹²⁰ Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination.¹²¹ Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address.¹²² Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity¹²³ and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient.¹²⁴ However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message.¹²⁵ Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination.¹²⁶ Tor is a publicly available onion routing service¹²⁷ and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others.¹²⁸ Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.¹²⁹\nDespite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses\n¹¹⁸ Id. at 537-38.\n¹¹⁹ Id. at 537.\n¹²⁰ W.

As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest,¹³⁵ that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered.¹³⁶ According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries.¹³⁷ The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions.¹³⁸ The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems.¹³⁹ In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access.¹⁴⁰ Additionally, because the telecommunica\n¹³⁰ See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n¹³¹ Id. at 39-40.\n¹³² Id. at 40.\n¹³³ Id.\n¹³⁴ David E.

Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes\nEven if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n## IV. CASE STUDIES\nWhile there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n¹⁴¹ Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

Estonia\n1. Background\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online.¹⁴⁴ In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial.¹⁴⁵ The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians.¹⁴⁶ Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks.¹⁴⁷ These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects.¹⁴⁸ While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.¹⁴⁹\n2. Neutrality Analysis\nBecause these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force.¹⁵⁰ While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions,¹⁵¹ it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n¹⁴⁴ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n¹⁴⁵ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n¹⁴⁶ *Id.* at 15.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.* at 18-21.\n¹⁴⁸ *Id.* at 24-25.\n¹⁴⁹ *Id.* at 23.\n¹⁵⁰ Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n¹⁵¹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\nCyber Neutrality 93\nMost of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS).¹⁵² This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses.¹⁵³ The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance.¹⁵⁴ Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area.¹⁵⁵ While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems,¹⁵⁶ they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights.¹⁵⁷ What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict,¹⁵⁸ exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces. However, because of the way DoS attacks work, often enslaving computers all over the world, fully applying neutrality rules to the activity of\n¹⁵² Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 21.\n¹⁵³ EA-6B Prowler Mission, Description, and Specifications, Naval Air Systems Command Website, available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=C8B54023-C006-4699-BD20-9A45FBA02B9A (last visited Apr 13, 2013) [hereinafter, EA-6B Details].\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ David Axe, Secret Army Bomb Jammers Stolen in Afghanistan, WIRED, Mar. 1, 2012, available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/bomb-jammers-stolen/.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n¹⁵⁷ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n¹⁵⁸ See supra notes 70-71 and accompanying text.\n94 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nevery computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.”¹⁵⁹ If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\nB. Georgia\n1. Background\nWhile the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia.¹⁶⁰ On August 8, 2008, Russian military\n¹⁵⁹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n¹⁶⁰ Id. at 67.\nCyber Neutrality 95\nforces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military.¹⁶¹ In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war.¹⁶² Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8,¹⁶³ although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities.¹⁶⁴ While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information.¹⁶⁵ The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites.¹⁶⁶ The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website.¹⁶⁷ As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets.¹⁶⁸ However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.¹⁶⁹\nAnother important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites.¹⁷⁰ Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government.¹⁷¹ The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.”¹⁷² After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.¹⁷³\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nCyber Neutrality 97\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\nThis conflict between Russia and Georgia raised two significant cyber neutrality issues. The first concerns the neutrality rights of Turkey while the second concerns the neutrality rights of the United States.\n### (a) Turkish Neutrality\nWhile Turkey did not formally declare itself to be a neutral in the Russian-Georgian armed conflict, which technically only lasted five days,¹⁷⁴ official Turkish statements suggested a desire to remain neutral. Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated:\n&gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.¹⁷⁵\nThese statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey,¹⁷⁶ Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral.¹⁷⁷ From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey\n---\n¹⁷⁴ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n¹⁷⁵ Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n¹⁷⁶ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n¹⁷⁷ Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.\nas taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities¹⁷⁸ and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action.¹⁷⁹ From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2¹⁸⁰ and Article 3¹⁸¹ could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the\n¹⁷⁸ See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n¹⁷⁹ Id. at art. 52.\n¹⁸⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n¹⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\n98 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nmeaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military.¹⁸² The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n## (b) United States' Neutrality\nThe second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral.¹⁸³ By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces”¹⁸⁴ on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.¹⁸⁵\nSome might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk.¹⁸⁶ While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities.¹⁸⁷ In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.”¹⁸⁸ It goes on to say that civilians who take “part\n¹⁸² For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n¹⁸³ Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n¹⁸⁴ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n¹⁸⁵ Id. at art. 5.\n¹⁸⁶ See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n¹⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n¹⁸⁸ Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8\nCyber Neutrality 99\nin armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.”¹⁸⁹ Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n## C. Stuxnet\nThe previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.\n## 1. Background\nOn June 17, 2010, an employee at VirusBlokAda, a small computer security firm in Belarus, read a report from a client in Iran showing that the client’s computer was continuously rebooting.¹⁹¹ The rebooting problem indicated a potential virus and employees at VirusBlokAda soon began analyzing the system for malicious software.¹⁹² They discovered a zero-day exploit in Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer.¹⁹³ Zero-day exploits are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to its designers and they are quite rare.¹⁹⁴ Software analysis later discovered that Stuxnet took advantage of several additional Windows vulnerabilities, including additional\nJUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, 618 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987).\n¹⁸⁹ Id.\n¹⁹⁰ See Michael N.

Bush demanded a “third option” besides letting Iran develop a nuclear weapon or starting a war with Iran.²⁰³ Stuxnet became that third option. According to Sanger, the goal was to capitalize on Iran’s volatile centrifuge design by initiating a series of apparently random centrifuge failures, with the hope that Iranian authorities would lose faith in the design, the parts, and/or their engineers.²⁰⁴\nOne of Stuxnet’s most intriguing aspects was its delivery. Natanz is a secure facility that is not connected to the Internet so its designers had to figure out a way to bridge the “air gap.”²⁰⁵ According to Symantec, Stuxnet was designed to spread\n¹⁹⁵ Nicolas Falliere et al., W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, Symantec Security Response 2 (Feb. 2011), available at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf [hereinafter, Stuxnet Dossier].\n¹⁹⁶ Zetter, supra note 191 (combining the file names .stub and MrxNet.sys from the software code).\n¹⁹⁷ Id.\n¹⁹⁸ Id.\n¹⁹⁹ Id.\n²⁰⁰ Id.\n²⁰¹ DAVID E.

Neutrality Analysis\nWhile Stuxnet did not occur during an armed conflict and therefore did not directly raise any neutrality issues, it did prove an effective operational concept that will likely be used in future conflicts. As evidenced by the Estonia and Georgia\n²⁰⁶ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 2. Interestingly, the United States Department of Defense banned the use of thumb drives around this same time. See Noah Shachtman, Under Worm Assault, Military Bans Disks, USB Drives, WIRED (Nov. 19, 2008 3:12 PM), available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/army-bans-usb-d/.\n²⁰⁷ SANGER, supra 201, at 196.\n²⁰⁸ Zetter, supra note 191.\n²⁰⁹ Id.\n²¹⁰ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 21.\n²¹¹ Zetter, supra note 191.\n²¹² Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 34.\n²¹³ Id. at 6.\n²¹⁴ SANGER, supra 201, at 204-205.\n²¹⁵ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 7.\n²¹⁶ Id.\n102 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nexamples, military leaders are seemingly learning the value of effective cyber operations and will likely incorporate them into future war plans. With Stuxnet’s code now available for anyone to tinker with or modify, it is reasonable to assume that the next major international conflict will include malware similar to, or modeled after, Stuxnet. For example, industrial control systems, similar to the one used at Natanz, are found in petroleum refinement plants, chemical production plants, and electrical power generation and transmission plants.²¹⁷ It is fairly easy to imagine any of these plants as constituting a legitimate military target during a future armed conflict.\nUsing malware like Stuxnet in an armed conflict would raise at least two significant neutrality concerns: (1) the location of command and control servers and (2) delivery routes. The analysis of the command and control server issue is similar for a Stuxnet-type operation as it would be for a DoS attack but the arguments are stronger. Stuxnet used at least two different command and control servers, one in Malaysia and one in Denmark, but could have been updated throughout the operation to communicate with different command and control servers.²¹⁸ If Stuxnet had occurred during the course of an armed conflict, Malaysia and Denmark would have been in a difficult position. If Stuxnet was developed as a way to achieve effects comparable to attacking Natanz with conventional weapons,²¹⁹ it essentially substituted for conventional weapons. When military planners can use certain cyber capabilities and conventional weapons interchangeably, it defies logic to apply the neutrality rules to one and not the other.\nWith respect to Hague V, the analysis remains the same for the command and controls servers in the Stuxnet context as it does in the DoS attack context. The command and control servers in this scenario would be acting as virtual “wireless telegraphy stations” for the purpose of “communicating with belligerent forces” in violation of Article 3.²²⁰ The Stuxnet command and control servers compiled data received from each infected computer²²¹ and presumably sent that data to Stuxnet’s creators. Additionally, Stuxnet’s creators likely used the command and control servers to push updated versions of the code out to infected computers.²²² In an armed conflict scenario, it would be difficult to argue that these command and control servers are not communicating with belligerent forces. Furthermore, if malware has the ability to shut down a power grid or cripple an oil refinery, a belligerent may be more likely to respond militarily once it discovers the threat. Such a response might include damaging or disabling any known command and control servers or other\n²¹⁷ SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CENTER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE SECURITY POSTURE OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (Version 1.1, Aug. 20, 2010), available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/ics/ics_fact_sheet.pdf.\n²¹⁸ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²¹⁹ SANGER, supra note 201, at 188-191.\n²²⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n²²¹ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²²² Zetter, supra note 191.\nCyber Neutrality 103\nvital network elements residing in that neutral state. As the likelihood of a military response against a neutral state’s network components increases, so does the need to apply the law of neutrality in order to prevent the spread of conflict.\nThe other aspect of Stuxnet that raises potential neutrality issues concerns the specific delivery path or paths the malicious code travels. Does the law of neutrality prohibit malicious packets of information from traveling over the network infrastructure of a neutral state on the way to a belligerent target? Applying the law of neutrality to this particular scenario is problematic for two reasons. First, individual packets might not all take the same route and users may not be able to control the route.²²³ Second, applicable neutrality rules are not likely needed in this situation to prevent the spread of conflict. Put another way, the fact that some packets travel over a neutral’s network on the way to a belligerent is not likely to trigger any military action against the neutral’s network. The Internet’s redundant design means that any military action to shut down one particular route would not have much, or any, practical effect; the packets will just take a different route.²²⁴ While not a perfect fit, this narrow situation should still fall under the scope of Hague V’s telegraph exception.²²⁵ The telegraph exception was largely based on practical limitations²²⁶ that are especially applicable to controlling or monitoring the delivery routes of individual packets. Furthermore, using the roads analogy discussed earlier, it is more appropriate to view the telecommunications service provider as transporting the code in this scenario since it is the service provider who is directing the path, not the belligerent.\nWhile it may not be appropriate to apply the neutrality rules to the delivery routes of individual packets in most cases, it is important to distinguish the situation where a belligerent uses a proxy in a neutral state. While belligerents may not be able to control the specific routes packets take, a belligerent ensures the packets go through a neutral state by using a proxy in that neutral state. A belligerent may use a proxy in a neutral state in order to make it appear as if the neutral state is supporting its effort or simply because the enemy may not scrutinize Internet traffic emanating from that neutral country in the same way it scrutinizes other Internet traffic. Either way, the deliberate use of proxy in a neutral state is likely an attempt to derive some form of military advantage from a neutral’s territorial infrastructure and is prohibited.²²⁷ This essentially collapses the neutrality analysis for the delivery of packets into an intent-based analysis, an approach often advocated.²²⁸ Addition-\n²²³ See Boebert, supra note 120, at 41-42.\n²²⁴ See id. at 42.\n²²⁵ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8.\n²²⁶ See Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 543.\n²²⁷ See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 1 (“The territory of neutral States is inviolable.”).\n²²⁸ See, e.g., Davis Brown, A Proposal for an International Convention to Regulate the Use of Information Systems in Armed Conflict, 47 HARV. INT’L L.J. 179, 210-11 (2006); Jeffrey T.G. Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principles of Distinction and\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\nally, while there may not be much practical value in taking military action against a neutral’s network that is only carrying packets, “bricking”²²⁹ a proxy may be an effective countermeasure. Neutral states should not become cyber battle grounds for belligerents, where the burden of collateral damage would rest entirely on the neutral state.\nAs in the Georgia example, attribution limitations will not bar military action. Attribution limitations are certainly relevant, especially in conducting a proportionality analysis, but the fact remains that objects which are being used to “make an effective contribution to military action” are military objects and may be attacked.²³⁰ Every proxy computer in the chain would likely meet this definition and would therefore be subject to attack. For that matter, the cables that merely carry packets could also qualify as military, or dual-use, objects but the negligible military advantage to be gained by attacking them might be difficult to justify under a proportionality analysis.²³¹ As with the DoS attack scenario, it is technical attribution to a particular node/computer that triggers a belligerent’s ability to take military action against that particular node/computer, regardless of whether the belligerent can further attribute the conduct to a person, organization, or government.²³²\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThe neutrality rules are over a hundred years old and did not envision modern cyber capabilities but technological innovation in weaponry is nothing new. When cyber capabilities can viably substitute for conventional capabilities, whether they are damage-causing or damage-enabling capabilities, the neutrality rules must equally apply in order to preserve state sovereignty. Without applicable neutrality rules, belligerents will derive strategic advantages by purposely exploiting components of a neutral state’s infrastructure. Allowing the cyber component of the battlefield to expand to neutral states erodes a neutral state’s ability to stay out of a conflict. Belligerents do not seek symmetric responses. They constantly seek opportunities to overwhelm the enemy in the place and manner where they perceive an advantage. There is no guarantee that the cyber component of the battlefield could spread to neutral states without the conventional battlefield expanding there as well.\nAttribution remains a challenge, especially when it comes to punishing belligerents who might choose to violate a neutral state’s rights. Not only is technical attribution difficult but holding a state responsible also requires human attribution.\nNeutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1427, 1448-49 (2008).\n²²⁹ The term “bricking” refers to software or firmware changes that completely, and often permanently, disable a computer. See John Haubenreich, The iPhone and the DMCA: Locking the Hands of Customers, 61 VAND. L. REV. 1507, 1538, n.201 (2008).\n²³⁰ Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 52.\n²³¹ Id. at art. 51.\n²³² See supra notes 178-179 and accompanying text.\nCyber Neutrality 105\nThese attribution challenges may limit the deterrent value of applying the neutrality rules to cyber operations. However, as evidenced by the Mandiant report, large, prolonged cyber operations may be difficult to conceal indefinitely. Additionally, belligerents with sophisticated cyber capabilities may also rigorously monitor and control their own networks, strengthening attribution arguments based on Corfu Channel’s rationale. Finally, while attribution certainly poses a problem in holding belligerents responsible for neutrality violations, it is less important when the neutrality rules are used to impose a duty on neutral states. Neutral states may not have the incentive to dedicate the resources necessary to monitor their own networks, but belligerents do. When a belligerent traces malicious cyber activity to components of a neutral state’s infrastructure, it should be able to require the neutral state to take appropriate action if that state wants to remain neutral.\nAs with most areas of the law, technological advances create challenges. Sometimes the law is amended to explicitly deal with new technologies and sometimes the old law is interpreted to cover (or not cover) new technologies. When it comes to cyber capabilities and the law of neutrality, gaining international consensus to amend the law may not be possible and interpreting the law to not cover cyber operations threatens the entire institution of neutrality. By interpreting the neutrality rules with a focus on their purpose, states can usher respect for neutrality into twenty-first century warfare and continue to decide for themselves if and when to enter a conflict.\n106 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71"

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War* Whether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II¹ or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War,² deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race,³ where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities.⁴ Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace.⁵ Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility.⁶ With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.⁷ --- ¹ U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n² John S.

POST, Jan. 19, 2013, (available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-to-boost-cybersecurity- Along with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber\"forces\"or\"weaponry\"through a neutral state?\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n## II. NEUTRALITY Modern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.⁸ ## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 The 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically ⁸ For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes. RODERICK OGLEY, THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 199 (1970).\n\ndirected at articulating the rights and obligations of neutral states as well as the rights and obligations of belligerents towards neutral states. Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today⁹ and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\n\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.”¹⁰ The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1¹¹ but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.¹² Article 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”¹³ Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.¹⁴ Article 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”¹⁵ In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\nCyber Neutrality 73 ⁹ U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n¹⁰ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n¹¹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para.

Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.”²⁰ While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.”²¹ Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.”²² One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica- ¹⁶ *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n¹⁷ “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail...

Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War While Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed,²⁵ while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited.²⁶ Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.”²⁷ Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n### 1. International Armed Conflict vs. Non-international Armed Conflict Strictly speaking, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII only apply to international armed conflicts (IAC) between signatory nations.²⁸ While initially limited to state parties,²⁹ the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII are also now ²³ See Hague Reports, *supra* note 14, at 543.\n²⁴ *Id.* ²⁵ Convention Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War art. 10, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2415 [hereinafter Hague XIII].\n²⁶ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 8.\n²⁷ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 5.\n²⁸ See Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 20; Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art. 28.\n²⁹ *Id.* Cyber Neutrality 75 binding on all states as customary international law.³⁰ Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency.³¹ Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states.³² However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.³³ A civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC).³⁴ However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs,³⁵ the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply.³⁶ However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”³⁷ This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.³⁸ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 In the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says: Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.³⁹ However, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”⁴⁰ ## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality In addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n### (a) United Nations Charter The post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear.⁴¹ Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war,⁴² which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.”⁴³ With nearly all sovereign ³⁹ INT’L COMM.

Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require⁴⁵ all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42.⁴⁶ However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice.⁴⁷ While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights⁴⁸ held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States⁴⁹ often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war.⁵⁰ Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes,⁵¹ including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,”⁵² hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context.⁵³ Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.⁵⁴ ⁴⁴ See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n⁴⁵ U.N.

Walker, Information Warfare (b) Other Collective Security Agreements However, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members⁵⁵ of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”⁵⁶ This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”⁵⁷ By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area.⁵⁸ The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan,⁵⁹ South Korea,⁶⁰ and the Philippines⁶¹ that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.”⁶² The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting and Neutrality, 33 VAND.

Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations,⁶⁵ how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace Even though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace.⁶⁶ Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.⁶⁷ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 While the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would Cyber Neutrality 81 likely be viewed as a use of force.”⁷⁴ Koh went on to say “[a] State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof.”⁷⁵ While it is unclear to what extent the international community embraces the ability to assert self-defense rights in response to a malicious cyber activity,⁷⁶ with the United States taking an unequivocal position and NATO suggesting a similar stance,⁷⁷ others may follow.\nIt is a state’s ability to assert self-defense rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter that is so important to the neutrality analysis. If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations ⁷⁴ Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n⁷⁵ *Id.* ⁷⁶ See generally Lt Col. Patrick W. Franzese, *Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 64 A.F. L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2009).\n⁷⁷ See *Defending the Networks: The NATO Policy on Cyber Defence*, N. Atl. Treaty Org.

NATO will defend its territory and populations against all threats, including emerging security challenges such as cyber defence” and “NATO will maintain strategic ambiguity as well as flexibility on how to respond to different types of crises that include a cyber component.”).\n\nstressed in Hague V will still serve as distinct boundaries in the analysis. The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory.⁷⁸ In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.”⁷⁹ The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.”⁸⁰ The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.”⁸¹ The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies.⁸² The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population.⁸³ In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral ⁷⁸ Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n⁷⁹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n⁸⁰ OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n⁸² Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n⁸³ Id. at 542.\nCyber Neutrality 83 states, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming\"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the\"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\"that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term\"combatant\"makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 an individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\nCyber Neutrality 85 In order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE Meaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility The purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93 Article 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 been empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7.⁹⁶ Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”⁹⁷ Article 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁹⁸ A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor.⁹⁹ Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.”¹⁰⁰ Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group.¹⁰¹ While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged.¹⁰² The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹⁰³ However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n⁹⁶ Id. at art. 7.\n⁹⁷ Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n⁹⁸ Id. at art. 8.\n⁹⁹ Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n¹⁰⁰ Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n¹⁰¹ See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n¹⁰² Id. at 315.\n¹⁰³ Id. at 115.\nCyber Neutrality 87 in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”¹⁰⁴ The commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation.¹⁰⁵ In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters.¹⁰⁶ The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability.¹⁰⁷ Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.”¹⁰⁸ The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.”¹⁰⁹ The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities.¹¹⁰ This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.¹¹¹ ¹⁰⁴ ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n¹⁰⁵ Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n¹⁰⁶ Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n¹⁰⁷ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁸ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁹ Id. at 18.\n¹¹⁰ Id. at 18-20.\n¹¹¹ See, e.g., Scott J.

Technical and Human Attribution Attribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security.[112] A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets.[113] Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message.[114] Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.[115] One of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or\"spoofed.\"[116] While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly.[117] While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking Cyber Neutrality a response.¹¹⁸ When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.¹¹⁹ When the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies.¹²⁰ Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination.¹²¹ Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address.¹²² Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity¹²³ and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient.¹²⁴ However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message.¹²⁵ Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination.¹²⁶ Tor is a publicly available onion routing service¹²⁷ and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others.¹²⁸ Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.¹²⁹ Despite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses ¹¹⁸ Id. at 537-38.\n¹¹⁹ Id. at 537.\n¹²⁰ W. Earl Boebert, *A Survey of Challenges in Attribution*, in *COMM.

As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest,¹³⁵ that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered.¹³⁶ According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries.¹³⁷ The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions.¹³⁸ The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems.¹³⁹ In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access.¹⁴⁰ Additionally, because the telecommunica ¹³⁰ See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n¹³¹ Id. at 39-40.\n¹³² Id. at 40.\n¹³³ Id.\n¹³⁴ David E.

Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes Even if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n## IV. CASE STUDIES While there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n¹⁴¹ Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

Estonia\n\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online.¹⁴⁴ In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial.¹⁴⁵ The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians.¹⁴⁶ Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks.¹⁴⁷ These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects.¹⁴⁸ While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.¹⁴⁹ Because these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force.¹⁵⁰ While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions,¹⁵¹ it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n¹⁴⁴ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n¹⁴⁵ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n¹⁴⁶ *Id.* at 15.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.* at 18-21.\n¹⁴⁸ *Id.* at 24-25.\n¹⁴⁹ *Id.* at 23.\n¹⁵⁰ Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n¹⁵¹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\nCyber Neutrality 93 Most of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS).¹⁵² This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses.¹⁵³ The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance.¹⁵⁴ Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area.¹⁵⁵ While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems,¹⁵⁶ they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights.¹⁵⁷ What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict,¹⁵⁸ exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces. However, because of the way DoS attacks work, often enslaving computers all over the world, fully applying neutrality rules to the activity of ¹⁵² Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 21.\n¹⁵³ EA-6B Prowler Mission, Description, and Specifications, Naval Air Systems Command Website, available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=C8B54023-C006-4699-BD20-9A45FBA02B9A (last visited Apr 13, 2013) [hereinafter, EA-6B Details].\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ David Axe, Secret Army Bomb Jammers Stolen in Afghanistan, WIRED, Mar. 1, 2012, available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/bomb-jammers-stolen/.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n¹⁵⁷ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n¹⁵⁸ See supra notes 70-71 and accompanying text.\n\nevery computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.”¹⁵⁹ If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\nB. Georgia While the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia.¹⁶⁰ On August 8, 2008, Russian military ¹⁵⁹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n¹⁶⁰ Id. at 67.\nCyber Neutrality 95 forces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military.¹⁶¹ In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war.¹⁶² Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8,¹⁶³ although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities.¹⁶⁴ While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information.¹⁶⁵ The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites.¹⁶⁶ The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website.¹⁶⁷ As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets.¹⁶⁸ However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.¹⁶⁹ Another important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites.¹⁷⁰ Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government.¹⁷¹ The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.”¹⁷² After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.¹⁷³ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 Cyber Neutrality 97 ## 2. Neutrality Analysis This conflict between Russia and Georgia raised two significant cyber neutrality issues. The first concerns the neutrality rights of Turkey while the second concerns the neutrality rights of the United States.\n### (a) Turkish Neutrality While Turkey did not formally declare itself to be a neutral in the Russian-Georgian armed conflict, which technically only lasted five days,¹⁷⁴ official Turkish statements suggested a desire to remain neutral. Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated: &gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.¹⁷⁵ These statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey,¹⁷⁶ Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral.¹⁷⁷ From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey --- ¹⁷⁴ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n¹⁷⁵ Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n¹⁷⁶ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n¹⁷⁷ Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.\nas taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities¹⁷⁸ and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action.¹⁷⁹ From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2¹⁸⁰ and Article 3¹⁸¹ could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the ¹⁷⁸ See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n¹⁷⁹ Id. at art. 52.\n¹⁸⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n¹⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\n\nmeaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military.¹⁸² The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n## (b) United States' Neutrality The second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral.¹⁸³ By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces”¹⁸⁴ on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.¹⁸⁵ Some might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk.¹⁸⁶ While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities.¹⁸⁷ In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.”¹⁸⁸ It goes on to say that civilians who take “part ¹⁸² For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n¹⁸³ Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n¹⁸⁴ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n¹⁸⁵ Id. at art. 5.\n¹⁸⁶ See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n¹⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n¹⁸⁸ Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8 Cyber Neutrality 99 in armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.”¹⁸⁹ Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n## C. Stuxnet The previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.\n## 1. Background On June 17, 2010, an employee at VirusBlokAda, a small computer security firm in Belarus, read a report from a client in Iran showing that the client’s computer was continuously rebooting.¹⁹¹ The rebooting problem indicated a potential virus and employees at VirusBlokAda soon began analyzing the system for malicious software.¹⁹² They discovered a zero-day exploit in Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer.¹⁹³ Zero-day exploits are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to its designers and they are quite rare.¹⁹⁴ Software analysis later discovered that Stuxnet took advantage of several additional Windows vulnerabilities, including additional JUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, 618 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987).\n¹⁸⁹ Id.\n¹⁹⁰ See Michael N.

Bush demanded a “third option” besides letting Iran develop a nuclear weapon or starting a war with Iran.²⁰³ Stuxnet became that third option. According to Sanger, the goal was to capitalize on Iran’s volatile centrifuge design by initiating a series of apparently random centrifuge failures, with the hope that Iranian authorities would lose faith in the design, the parts, and/or their engineers.²⁰⁴ One of Stuxnet’s most intriguing aspects was its delivery. Natanz is a secure facility that is not connected to the Internet so its designers had to figure out a way to bridge the “air gap.”²⁰⁵ According to Symantec, Stuxnet was designed to spread ¹⁹⁵ Nicolas Falliere et al., W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, Symantec Security Response 2 (Feb. 2011), available at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf [hereinafter, Stuxnet Dossier].\n¹⁹⁶ Zetter, supra note 191 (combining the file names.stub and MrxNet.sys from the software code).\n¹⁹⁷ Id.\n¹⁹⁸ Id.\n¹⁹⁹ Id.\n²⁰⁰ Id.\n²⁰¹ DAVID E.

Neutrality Analysis While Stuxnet did not occur during an armed conflict and therefore did not directly raise any neutrality issues, it did prove an effective operational concept that will likely be used in future conflicts. As evidenced by the Estonia and Georgia ²⁰⁶ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 2. Interestingly, the United States Department of Defense banned the use of thumb drives around this same time. See Noah Shachtman, Under Worm Assault, Military Bans Disks, USB Drives, WIRED (Nov. 19, 2008 3:12 PM), available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/army-bans-usb-d/.\n²⁰⁷ SANGER, supra 201, at 196.\n²⁰⁸ Zetter, supra note 191.\n²⁰⁹ Id.\n²¹⁰ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 21.\n²¹¹ Zetter, supra note 191.\n²¹² Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 34.\n²¹³ Id. at 6.\n²¹⁴ SANGER, supra 201, at 204-205.\n²¹⁵ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 7.\n²¹⁶ Id.\n\nexamples, military leaders are seemingly learning the value of effective cyber operations and will likely incorporate them into future war plans. With Stuxnet’s code now available for anyone to tinker with or modify, it is reasonable to assume that the next major international conflict will include malware similar to, or modeled after, Stuxnet. For example, industrial control systems, similar to the one used at Natanz, are found in petroleum refinement plants, chemical production plants, and electrical power generation and transmission plants.²¹⁷ It is fairly easy to imagine any of these plants as constituting a legitimate military target during a future armed conflict.\nUsing malware like Stuxnet in an armed conflict would raise at least two significant neutrality concerns: (1) the location of command and control servers and (2) delivery routes. The analysis of the command and control server issue is similar for a Stuxnet-type operation as it would be for a DoS attack but the arguments are stronger. Stuxnet used at least two different command and control servers, one in Malaysia and one in Denmark, but could have been updated throughout the operation to communicate with different command and control servers.²¹⁸ If Stuxnet had occurred during the course of an armed conflict, Malaysia and Denmark would have been in a difficult position. If Stuxnet was developed as a way to achieve effects comparable to attacking Natanz with conventional weapons,²¹⁹ it essentially substituted for conventional weapons. When military planners can use certain cyber capabilities and conventional weapons interchangeably, it defies logic to apply the neutrality rules to one and not the other.\nWith respect to Hague V, the analysis remains the same for the command and controls servers in the Stuxnet context as it does in the DoS attack context. The command and control servers in this scenario would be acting as virtual “wireless telegraphy stations” for the purpose of “communicating with belligerent forces” in violation of Article 3.²²⁰ The Stuxnet command and control servers compiled data received from each infected computer²²¹ and presumably sent that data to Stuxnet’s creators. Additionally, Stuxnet’s creators likely used the command and control servers to push updated versions of the code out to infected computers.²²² In an armed conflict scenario, it would be difficult to argue that these command and control servers are not communicating with belligerent forces. Furthermore, if malware has the ability to shut down a power grid or cripple an oil refinery, a belligerent may be more likely to respond militarily once it discovers the threat. Such a response might include damaging or disabling any known command and control servers or other ²¹⁷ SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CENTER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE SECURITY POSTURE OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (Version 1.1, Aug. 20, 2010), available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/ics/ics_fact_sheet.pdf.\n²¹⁸ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²¹⁹ SANGER, supra note 201, at 188-191.\n²²⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n²²¹ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²²² Zetter, supra note 191.\nCyber Neutrality 103 vital network elements residing in that neutral state. As the likelihood of a military response against a neutral state’s network components increases, so does the need to apply the law of neutrality in order to prevent the spread of conflict.\nThe other aspect of Stuxnet that raises potential neutrality issues concerns the specific delivery path or paths the malicious code travels. Does the law of neutrality prohibit malicious packets of information from traveling over the network infrastructure of a neutral state on the way to a belligerent target? Applying the law of neutrality to this particular scenario is problematic for two reasons. First, individual packets might not all take the same route and users may not be able to control the route.²²³ Second, applicable neutrality rules are not likely needed in this situation to prevent the spread of conflict. Put another way, the fact that some packets travel over a neutral’s network on the way to a belligerent is not likely to trigger any military action against the neutral’s network. The Internet’s redundant design means that any military action to shut down one particular route would not have much, or any, practical effect; the packets will just take a different route.²²⁴ While not a perfect fit, this narrow situation should still fall under the scope of Hague V’s telegraph exception.²²⁵ The telegraph exception was largely based on practical limitations²²⁶ that are especially applicable to controlling or monitoring the delivery routes of individual packets. Furthermore, using the roads analogy discussed earlier, it is more appropriate to view the telecommunications service provider as transporting the code in this scenario since it is the service provider who is directing the path, not the belligerent.\nWhile it may not be appropriate to apply the neutrality rules to the delivery routes of individual packets in most cases, it is important to distinguish the situation where a belligerent uses a proxy in a neutral state. While belligerents may not be able to control the specific routes packets take, a belligerent ensures the packets go through a neutral state by using a proxy in that neutral state. A belligerent may use a proxy in a neutral state in order to make it appear as if the neutral state is supporting its effort or simply because the enemy may not scrutinize Internet traffic emanating from that neutral country in the same way it scrutinizes other Internet traffic. Either way, the deliberate use of proxy in a neutral state is likely an attempt to derive some form of military advantage from a neutral’s territorial infrastructure and is prohibited.²²⁷ This essentially collapses the neutrality analysis for the delivery of packets into an intent-based analysis, an approach often advocated.²²⁸ Addition- ²²³ See Boebert, supra note 120, at 41-42.\n²²⁴ See id. at 42.\n²²⁵ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8.\n²²⁶ See Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 543.\n²²⁷ See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 1 (“The territory of neutral States is inviolable.”).\n²²⁸ See, e.g., Davis Brown, A Proposal for an International Convention to Regulate the Use of Information Systems in Armed Conflict, 47 HARV. INT’L L.J. 179, 210-11 (2006); Jeffrey T.G. Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principles of Distinction and The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 ally, while there may not be much practical value in taking military action against a neutral’s network that is only carrying packets, “bricking”²²⁹ a proxy may be an effective countermeasure. Neutral states should not become cyber battle grounds for belligerents, where the burden of collateral damage would rest entirely on the neutral state.\nAs in the Georgia example, attribution limitations will not bar military action. Attribution limitations are certainly relevant, especially in conducting a proportionality analysis, but the fact remains that objects which are being used to “make an effective contribution to military action” are military objects and may be attacked.²³⁰ Every proxy computer in the chain would likely meet this definition and would therefore be subject to attack. For that matter, the cables that merely carry packets could also qualify as military, or dual-use, objects but the negligible military advantage to be gained by attacking them might be difficult to justify under a proportionality analysis.²³¹ As with the DoS attack scenario, it is technical attribution to a particular node/computer that triggers a belligerent’s ability to take military action against that particular node/computer, regardless of whether the belligerent can further attribute the conduct to a person, organization, or government.²³² ## V. CONCLUSION The neutrality rules are over a hundred years old and did not envision modern cyber capabilities but technological innovation in weaponry is nothing new. When cyber capabilities can viably substitute for conventional capabilities, whether they are damage-causing or damage-enabling capabilities, the neutrality rules must equally apply in order to preserve state sovereignty. Without applicable neutrality rules, belligerents will derive strategic advantages by purposely exploiting components of a neutral state’s infrastructure. Allowing the cyber component of the battlefield to expand to neutral states erodes a neutral state’s ability to stay out of a conflict. Belligerents do not seek symmetric responses. They constantly seek opportunities to overwhelm the enemy in the place and manner where they perceive an advantage. There is no guarantee that the cyber component of the battlefield could spread to neutral states without the conventional battlefield expanding there as well.\nAttribution remains a challenge, especially when it comes to punishing belligerents who might choose to violate a neutral state’s rights. Not only is technical attribution difficult but holding a state responsible also requires human attribution.\nNeutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1427, 1448-49 (2008).\n²²⁹ The term “bricking” refers to software or firmware changes that completely, and often permanently, disable a computer. See John Haubenreich, The iPhone and the DMCA: Locking the Hands of Customers, 61 VAND. L. REV. 1507, 1538, n.201 (2008).\n²³⁰ Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 52.\n²³¹ Id. at art. 51.\n²³² See supra notes 178-179 and accompanying text.\nCyber Neutrality 105 These attribution challenges may limit the deterrent value of applying the neutrality rules to cyber operations. However, as evidenced by the Mandiant report, large, prolonged cyber operations may be difficult to conceal indefinitely. Additionally, belligerents with sophisticated cyber capabilities may also rigorously monitor and control their own networks, strengthening attribution arguments based on Corfu Channel’s rationale. Finally, while attribution certainly poses a problem in holding belligerents responsible for neutrality violations, it is less important when the neutrality rules are used to impose a duty on neutral states. Neutral states may not have the incentive to dedicate the resources necessary to monitor their own networks, but belligerents do. When a belligerent traces malicious cyber activity to components of a neutral state’s infrastructure, it should be able to require the neutral state to take appropriate action if that state wants to remain neutral.\nAs with most areas of the law, technological advances create challenges. Sometimes the law is amended to explicitly deal with new technologies and sometimes the old law is interpreted to cover (or not cover) new technologies. When it comes to cyber capabilities and the law of neutrality, gaining international consensus to amend the law may not be possible and interpreting the law to not cover cyber operations threatens the entire institution of neutrality. By interpreting the neutrality rules with a focus on their purpose, states can usher respect for neutrality into twenty-first century warfare and continue to decide for themselves if and when to enter a conflict."

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War* Whether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II¹ or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War,² deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race,³ where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities.⁴ Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace.⁵ Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility.⁶ With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.⁷ --- ¹ U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n² John S.

POST, Jan. 19, 2013, (available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-to-boost-cybersecurity- Along with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber\"forces\"or\"weaponry\"through a neutral state?\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n## II. NEUTRALITY Modern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.⁸ ## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 The 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically ⁸ For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes. RODERICK OGLEY, THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 199 (1970).\ndirected at articulating the rights and obligations of neutral states as well as the rights and obligations of belligerents towards neutral states. Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today⁹ and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.”¹⁰ The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1¹¹ but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.¹² Article 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”¹³ Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.¹⁴ Article 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”¹⁵ In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\nCyber Neutrality 73 ⁹ U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n¹⁰ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n¹¹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para. XIII.A.1, at 35(2012) [hereinafter ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK].\n¹² See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8 (creating a neutrality exception when using publicly available communication networks).\n¹³ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n¹⁴ See James Brown Scott, The Reports to the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, at 539 (1917) [hereinafter Hague Reports].\n¹⁵ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\nArticle 4 prevents belligerents from forming a “corps of combatants…on the territory of a neutral Power to assist the belligerents.”¹⁶ Would this prevent a belligerent from forming a botnet¹⁷ on the territory of a neutral that could launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on enemy command and control networks?\nArticle 5 highlights the key duty of a neutral power, namely to prevent belligerents from performing any of the actions prohibited in Articles 2 through 4.¹⁸ Neutral states may even be required to apply force to comply with these duties.¹⁹ Practically speaking, how could a neutral state prevent belligerents from using its infrastructure if belligerent cyber activities amounted to a violation of Article 2, 3, or 4?\nArticle 8 lays out an important exception when it comes to the applicability of Hague V to cyber operations. Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.”²⁰ While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.”²¹ Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.”²² One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica- ¹⁶ *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n¹⁷ “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail... The computer is compromised via a Trojan that often works by opening an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel that waits for commands from the person in control of the botnet.

Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War While Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed,²⁵ while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited.²⁶ Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.”²⁷ Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n### 1. International Armed Conflict vs. Non-international Armed Conflict Strictly speaking, the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII only apply to international armed conflicts (IAC) between signatory nations.²⁸ While initially limited to state parties,²⁹ the provisions of Hague V and Hague XIII are also now ²³ See Hague Reports, *supra* note 14, at 543.\n²⁴ *Id.* ²⁵ Convention Concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War art. 10, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2415 [hereinafter Hague XIII].\n²⁶ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 8.\n²⁷ Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art 5.\n²⁸ See Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 20; Hague XIII, *supra* note 25, art. 28.\n²⁹ *Id.* Cyber Neutrality 75 binding on all states as customary international law.³⁰ Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency.³¹ Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states.³² However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.³³ A civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC).³⁴ However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs,³⁵ the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply.³⁶ However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”³⁷ This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.³⁸ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 In the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says: Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.³⁹ However, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”⁴⁰ ## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality In addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n### (a) United Nations Charter The post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear.⁴¹ Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war,⁴² which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.”⁴³ With nearly all sovereign ³⁹ INT’L COMM.

Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require⁴⁵ all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42.⁴⁶ However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice.⁴⁷ While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights⁴⁸ held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States⁴⁹ often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war.⁵⁰ Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes,⁵¹ including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,”⁵² hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context.⁵³ Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.⁵⁴ ⁴⁴ See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n⁴⁵ U.N.

Walker, Information Warfare (b) Other Collective Security Agreements However, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members⁵⁵ of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”⁵⁶ This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”⁵⁷ By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area.⁵⁸ The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan,⁵⁹ South Korea,⁶⁰ and the Philippines⁶¹ that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.”⁶² The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting and Neutrality, 33 VAND.

Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations,⁶⁵ how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace Even though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace.⁶⁶ Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.⁶⁷ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 While the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would Cyber Neutrality 81 likely be viewed as a use of force.”⁷⁴ Koh went on to say “[a] State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof.”⁷⁵ While it is unclear to what extent the international community embraces the ability to assert self-defense rights in response to a malicious cyber activity,⁷⁶ with the United States taking an unequivocal position and NATO suggesting a similar stance,⁷⁷ others may follow.\nIt is a state’s ability to assert self-defense rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter that is so important to the neutrality analysis. If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations ⁷⁴ Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n⁷⁵ *Id.* ⁷⁶ See generally Lt Col. Patrick W. Franzese, *Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 64 A.F. L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2009).\n⁷⁷ See *Defending the Networks: The NATO Policy on Cyber Defence*, N. Atl. Treaty Org.

NATO will defend its territory and populations against all threats, including emerging security challenges such as cyber defence” and “NATO will maintain strategic ambiguity as well as flexibility on how to respond to different types of crises that include a cyber component.”).\nstressed in Hague V will still serve as distinct boundaries in the analysis. The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory.⁷⁸ In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.”⁷⁹ The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.”⁸⁰ The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.”⁸¹ The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies.⁸² The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population.⁸³ In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral ⁷⁸ Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n⁷⁹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n⁸⁰ OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n⁸² Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n⁸³ Id. at 542.\nCyber Neutrality 83 states, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming\"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the\"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\"that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term\"combatant\"makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 an individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\nCyber Neutrality 85 In order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE Meaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility The purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93 Article 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 been empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7.⁹⁶ Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”⁹⁷ Article 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁹⁸ A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor.⁹⁹ Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.”¹⁰⁰ Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group.¹⁰¹ While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged.¹⁰² The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹⁰³ However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n⁹⁶ Id. at art. 7.\n⁹⁷ Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n⁹⁸ Id. at art. 8.\n⁹⁹ Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n¹⁰⁰ Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n¹⁰¹ See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n¹⁰² Id. at 315.\n¹⁰³ Id. at 115.\nCyber Neutrality 87 in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”¹⁰⁴ The commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation.¹⁰⁵ In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters.¹⁰⁶ The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability.¹⁰⁷ Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.”¹⁰⁸ The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.”¹⁰⁹ The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities.¹¹⁰ This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.¹¹¹ ¹⁰⁴ ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n¹⁰⁵ Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n¹⁰⁶ Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n¹⁰⁷ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁸ Id. at 18.\n¹⁰⁹ Id. at 18.\n¹¹⁰ Id. at 18-20.\n¹¹¹ See, e.g., Scott J.

Hathaway, Rebecca Crootof, Philip Levitz, Haley Nix, Aileen Nowlan, William Perdue, Julia Spiegel, The Law of Cyber Attack, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 855 (2012).\nB. Technical and Human Attribution Attribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security.[112] A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets.[113] Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message.[114] Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.[115] One of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or\"spoofed.\"[116] While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly.[117] While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking Cyber Neutrality a response.¹¹⁸ When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.¹¹⁹ When the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies.¹²⁰ Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination.¹²¹ Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address.¹²² Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity¹²³ and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient.¹²⁴ However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message.¹²⁵ Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination.¹²⁶ Tor is a publicly available onion routing service¹²⁷ and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others.¹²⁸ Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.¹²⁹ Despite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses ¹¹⁸ Id. at 537-38.\n¹¹⁹ Id. at 537.\n¹²⁰ W.

As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest,¹³⁵ that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered.¹³⁶ According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries.¹³⁷ The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions.¹³⁸ The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems.¹³⁹ In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access.¹⁴⁰ Additionally, because the telecommunica ¹³⁰ See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n¹³¹ Id. at 39-40.\n¹³² Id. at 40.\n¹³³ Id.\n¹³⁴ David E.

Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes Even if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n## IV. CASE STUDIES While there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n¹⁴¹ Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

Estonia\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online.¹⁴⁴ In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial.¹⁴⁵ The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians.¹⁴⁶ Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks.¹⁴⁷ These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects.¹⁴⁸ While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.¹⁴⁹ Because these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force.¹⁵⁰ While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions,¹⁵¹ it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n¹⁴⁴ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n¹⁴⁵ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n¹⁴⁶ *Id.* at 15.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.* at 18-21.\n¹⁴⁸ *Id.* at 24-25.\n¹⁴⁹ *Id.* at 23.\n¹⁵⁰ Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n¹⁵¹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\nCyber Neutrality 93 Most of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS).¹⁵² This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses.¹⁵³ The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance.¹⁵⁴ Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area.¹⁵⁵ While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems,¹⁵⁶ they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights.¹⁵⁷ What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict,¹⁵⁸ exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces. However, because of the way DoS attacks work, often enslaving computers all over the world, fully applying neutrality rules to the activity of ¹⁵² Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 21.\n¹⁵³ EA-6B Prowler Mission, Description, and Specifications, Naval Air Systems Command Website, available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=C8B54023-C006-4699-BD20-9A45FBA02B9A (last visited Apr 13, 2013) [hereinafter, EA-6B Details].\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ David Axe, Secret Army Bomb Jammers Stolen in Afghanistan, WIRED, Mar. 1, 2012, available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/bomb-jammers-stolen/.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n¹⁵⁷ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n¹⁵⁸ See supra notes 70-71 and accompanying text.\nevery computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.”¹⁵⁹ If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\nB. Georgia While the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia.¹⁶⁰ On August 8, 2008, Russian military ¹⁵⁹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n¹⁶⁰ Id. at 67.\nCyber Neutrality 95 forces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military.¹⁶¹ In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war.¹⁶² Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8,¹⁶³ although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities.¹⁶⁴ While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information.¹⁶⁵ The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites.¹⁶⁶ The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website.¹⁶⁷ As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets.¹⁶⁸ However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.¹⁶⁹ Another important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites.¹⁷⁰ Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government.¹⁷¹ The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.”¹⁷² After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.¹⁷³ The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71 Cyber Neutrality 97 ## 2. Neutrality Analysis This conflict between Russia and Georgia raised two significant cyber neutrality issues. The first concerns the neutrality rights of Turkey while the second concerns the neutrality rights of the United States.\n### (a) Turkish Neutrality While Turkey did not formally declare itself to be a neutral in the Russian-Georgian armed conflict, which technically only lasted five days,¹⁷⁴ official Turkish statements suggested a desire to remain neutral. Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated: &gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.¹⁷⁵ These statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey,¹⁷⁶ Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral.¹⁷⁷ From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey --- ¹⁷⁴ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n¹⁷⁵ Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n¹⁷⁶ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n¹⁷⁷ Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.\nas taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities¹⁷⁸ and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action.¹⁷⁹ From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2¹⁸⁰ and Article 3¹⁸¹ could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the ¹⁷⁸ See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n¹⁷⁹ Id. at art. 52.\n¹⁸⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n¹⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\nmeaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military.¹⁸² The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n## (b) United States' Neutrality The second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral.¹⁸³ By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces”¹⁸⁴ on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.¹⁸⁵ Some might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk.¹⁸⁶ While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities.¹⁸⁷ In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.”¹⁸⁸ It goes on to say that civilians who take “part ¹⁸² For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n¹⁸³ Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n¹⁸⁴ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n¹⁸⁵ Id. at art. 5.\n¹⁸⁶ See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n¹⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n¹⁸⁸ Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8 Cyber Neutrality 99 in armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.”¹⁸⁹ Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n## C. Stuxnet The previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.",

    "Cyber Neutrality 71\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nAll warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near—Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*\n\nWhether it was using inflatable tanks to confuse Nazis forces as to the location of the D-Day invasion in World War II¹ or allowing the media to incorrectly conclude and broadcast reports of an imminent amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War,² deception has persistently remained a fundamental aspect of warfare. However, the major technological developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries now allow for deception on a whole new scale. The ability to anonymously mislead an adversary or create harmful effects on an adversary from an ocean away through a few computer keystrokes would probably put a grin on Sun Tzu’s face. Today’s digitally networked world offers truly amazing benefits on a global scale but also creates newfound vulnerabilities. This has led to what some have referred to as a cyber arms race,³ where states are increasingly looking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities as a primary instrument of national power. Iran has been heavily investing in cyber capabilities.⁴ Russia and China are widely known as major actors in cyberspace.⁵ Apparent leaks from highly placed United States government officials suggested that United States and Israeli cyber experts co-developed a malware program, nicknamed Stuxnet, to disrupt operations at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility.⁶ With a fairly substantial list of benefits, including the inherent deniability of the Internet, it is easy to see why cyber operations are gaining international popularity, a trend that is likely to continue.⁷\n\n---\n\n¹ U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, PUBL’N NO. 72-18, NORMANDY, p. 15, (available at http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/072/72-18/CMH_Pub_72-18.pdf).\n\n² John S.

    "Along with its benefits, military uses of cyberspace present a number of legal challenges, both internationally and domestically. One key challenge is the difficulty of gaining international consensus on whether traditional laws of armed conflict apply to cyber operations. This article will analyze one of the traditional international rules of armed conflict that might limit a primary benefit of cyber operations: the ability to deceive an adversary. The law of neutrality limits certain deceptive behavior in traditional armed conflict. Maneuvering military forces and weaponry along unexpected routes to surprise an enemy has been a staple of warfare throughout history and is a legitimate form of deception so long as the route does not pass through a neutral state. Does this limitation also prevent maneuvering cyber \"forces\" or \"weaponry\" through a neutral state?\n\nPart II of this article will highlight the key neutrality rules that are potentially relevant to activities in cyberspace and then analyze the applicability of these rules to a belligerent's cyber operations. Part III will discuss international standards of attribution and where those standards might present practical problems in applying neutrality rules to cyber activities. Part IV will analyze the potential neutrality implications of several recently reported malicious cyber activities. Part V concludes that neutrality rules do place limits on deceptive cyber practices in an armed conflict. But, while individual belligerents generally have the ability to apply neutrality rules to their own conduct in the cyber domain, neutral states will have difficulty establishing neutrality violations by belligerents and will likely have to rely on notifications from the belligerents themselves.\n\n## II. NEUTRALITY\n\nModern neutrality rules flow from the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and derive from a general desire to localize conflict and prevent its spread. States who wish to remain neutral in any given conflict are obligated to take certain precautions so as to avoid improperly assisting a party to the conflict. In exchange for taking these precautions, belligerent states promise to respect the territory and citizens of neutral states. On paper, it is a fairly simple concept. However, in practice, the desire for belligerents to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages may test respect for neutrality, especially where violations are difficult to detect.⁸\n\n## A. Neutrality Rules—Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907\n\nThe 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences included a number of conventions related to resolving international disputes and proper behavior during international conflicts. Two of these conventions, Hague V and Hague XIII, were specifically\n\n⁸ For example, North Vietnamese troops used the dense terrain in Cambodia during the Vietnam War for sanctuary, movement of reinforcements, and communication purposes. RODERICK OGLEY, THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NEUTRALITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 199 (1970).\n\n72 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71",
    "directed at articulating the rights and obligations of neutral states as well as the rights and obligations of belligerents towards neutral states. Hague V dealt with the concepts of neutrality for land warfare while Hague XIII dealt with neutrality rules at sea. These two conventions are still good law today⁹ and form the analytical framework for applying neutrality concepts to conflicts in cyberspace.\n\n1. Hague V: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land\n\nArticle 1 of the Hague V articulates the key benefit for neutral states: “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable.”¹⁰ The principle of territorial sovereignty is a hallmark of modern international relations but it can be difficult to apply when cyber capabilities start complementing traditional tools of war. Launching an air attack through a neutral state’s sovereign airspace on the way to a target is a clear violation of Article 1¹¹ but it is much less clear when it comes to routing a malicious cyber activity through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the same target.¹²\n\nArticle 2 forbids the movement of “troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”¹³ Here, the term “convoy of munitions” could arguably include cyber weapons but the drafters of this article envisioned the movement of physical weapons over a neutral state’s territory.¹⁴\n\nArticle 3 prohibits belligerents from erecting on the “territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea” or using “any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”¹⁵ In the cyber context, this raises interesting questions about whether a virtual “wireless telegraphy station” would be prohibited if it could essentially perform the same function as a physical telegraphy station.\n\nCyber Neutrality 73\n\n⁹ U.S. Dep’t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013, at 479-480 (2013) (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf).\n\n¹⁰ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons In Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2310 [hereinafter Hague V].\n\n¹¹ INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL LAW DEP’T, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, JA 422, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, CH. 2, para.

    "Article 4 prevents belligerents from forming a “corps of combatants…on the territory of a neutral Power to assist the belligerents.”¹⁶ Would this prevent a belligerent from forming a botnet¹⁷ on the territory of a neutral that could launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on enemy command and control networks?\n\nArticle 5 highlights the key duty of a neutral power, namely to prevent belligerents from performing any of the actions prohibited in Articles 2 through 4.¹⁸ Neutral states may even be required to apply force to comply with these duties.¹⁹ Practically speaking, how could a neutral state prevent belligerents from using its infrastructure if belligerent cyber activities amounted to a violation of Article 2, 3, or 4?\n\nArticle 8 lays out an important exception when it comes to the applicability of Hague V to cyber operations. Article 8 says “[a] neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.”²⁰ While a neutral state does not have to prevent the use of telegraph or telephone lines by belligerents, there is still an obligation to allow equal use by belligerents. Article 9 says “[e]very measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.”²¹ Additionally, this impartiality requirement flows to private companies who may own or operate communication infrastructure. Article 9 goes on to say “[a] neutral Power must see to the same obligation being observed by companies or private individuals owning telegraph or telephone cables or wireless telegraphy apparatus.”²² One approach would be to cite this exception as blanket authority for a belligerent to use a neutral state’s infrastructure to transport malicious cyber code. However, reading this exception too broadly would tend to contravene the purposes of the neutrality rules and other articles arguably support a much more narrow reading of Article 8. Additionally, much of the rationale behind Article 8 seems to stem from the practical problems associated with preventing belligerents from using publicly available communica-\n\n¹⁶ *Id.*, supra note 10, art. 4.\n\n¹⁷ “[A] botnet is a large number of compromised computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses or flood a network or Web server with excessive requests to cause it to fail . . .

    "tion lines.²³ The official report of the 1907 Hague conference states that requiring neutrals to prevent belligerents from using these lines would encounter “objections of a practical kind . . . arising out of the considerable difficulties in exercising control, not to mention the confidential character of telegraphic correspondence and the rapidity necessary to this service.”²⁴ If modern technology can diminish some of those enforcement concerns, it would seem to make less sense to interpret Article 8 as sanctioning offensive cyber operations.\n\n## 2. Hague XIII: Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War\n\nWhile Hague XIII offers much less in the way of rules that are relevant to the cyber domain, certain provisions do help guide interpretations of Hague V. The main focus of Hague XIII is to regulate the manner in which belligerent warships may replenish at the ports of neutral states or transit their territorial waters. Mere transit through territorial waters is allowed,²⁵ while the arming of a vessel at the port of a neutral state is prohibited.²⁶ Article 5 restates a similar prohibition from Hague V, prohibiting belligerents from using “neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries” or “erect[ing] wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.”²⁷ Again, it seems to be the *control and operation* of a communication system on the territory (or in the territorial waters) of a neutral state versus the *mere use* of a public utility that is prohibited.\n\n## B. When do Neutrality Rules Apply in General?\n\nBefore analyzing the applicability of neutrality rules to cyber operations, it is helpful to define the general applicability of neutrality rules in traditional armed conflict. Even if neutrality rules apply to activities in cyberspace, the traditional limitations on neutrality rules will apply as well.\n\n### 1.

    "binding on all states as customary international law.³⁰ Formal neutrality rights and obligations only arise when there is a recognized state of belligerency.³¹ Belligerency is defined as a state of war between two sovereign states.³² However, neutrality rights and obligations will also arise in a civil war when foreign states recognize an insurgent force as a belligerent, essentially putting the insurgent force on equal footing with the established government.³³\n\nA civil war is by definition, a non-international armed conflict (NIAC).³⁴ However, just because neutrality rights and obligations arise during a civil war does not mean they apply in all types of NIACs. While some authors have argued that neutrality applies in all NIACs,³⁵ the better view is that recognized civil wars are the only type of NIAC where formal neutrality rules apply.³⁶ However, the inapplicability of formal neutrality rules to a NIAC does not mean that “neutral” states have no obligations with respect to the conflict participants. Apart from neutrality obligations, states owe each other a general duty to prevent their territory from being used in a way that causes harm to another state. In its first case, the International Court of Justice held that all states have an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”³⁷ This obligation applies at all times and therefore equally to IACs and NIACs. This obligation is only owed to other states, not to insurgencies, essentially creating something analogous to very basic neutrality obligations with respect to the legitimate government but not with respect to the insurgency.³⁸\n\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71",
    "In the context of cyber operations, the neutrality analysis in part depends on whether the cyber activity itself amounts to an armed conflict or is taking place within the context of a conventional armed conflict. It also depends on the conflict classification as either an IAC or NIAC, made more complicated by the different armed conflict thresholds between the two. The International Committee for the Red Cross Commentary to Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 says:\n\nAny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.³⁹\n\nHowever, for a NIAC, the armed conflict threshold is much higher. Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 describes “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.”⁴⁰\n\n## 2. The United Nations Charter and Collective Security Limitations on Neutrality\n\nIn addition to properly classifying the nature of a conflict, the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations may be limited by commitments under the United Nations (UN) Charter and any other applicable collective security agreements.\n\n### (a) United Nations Charter\n\nThe post-World War II era brought about significant changes to the practical applicability of neutrality rights and obligations, even causing speculation that neutrality would completely disappear.⁴¹ Much of this speculation was based upon the UN Charter’s outlawing of war,⁴² which is a pre-requisite for neutrality, and on the formal commitment to “give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes” and “refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.”⁴³ With nearly all sovereign\n\n³⁹ INT’L COMM.

    "states being members of the United Nations,⁴⁴ Article 2(5) would seem to leave little opportunity for states to remain neutral once the United Nations has acted. Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the authority to require⁴⁵ all member states to engage in non-forceful actions against an offending state under Article 41 or forceful actions under Article 42.⁴⁶ However, the UN Charter’s predicted impact in eliminating neutrality has not played out in practice.⁴⁷ While the Security Council does have significant enforcement authority, the veto rights⁴⁸ held by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States⁴⁹ often prevent full use of that authority. Between 1946 and 2012, a permanent member of the UN Security Council used a veto 269 times, though most were cast during the cold war.⁵⁰ Because Security Council resolutions require nine of fifteen affirmative votes,⁵¹ including affirmative or abstention votes from all five permanent member states, politics have seemingly prevented the kind of actions that would effectively nullify neutrality opportunities. Instead, Security Council enforcement actions tend to use language like “requests,” “invites,” “encourages,” “authorizes,” “endorses,” or “urges,”⁵² hardly the kind of forceful language that might require a state to abandon a neutrality stance. Even the stronger “calls upon” language sometimes used in Security Council resolutions does not usually equate to a mandate when read in context.⁵³ Scholars in this area tend to agree that while the Security Council has the potential to drastically limit, or even eliminate, a state’s ability to act as a neutral with respect to a particular armed conflict, history suggests that political realities still leave room for neutrality.⁵⁴\n\n⁴⁴ See United Nations membership list available at http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml.\n⁴⁵ U.N.

    "(b) Other Collective Security Agreements\n\nHowever, even if the UN Security Council fails to take action, or takes action that allows for optional participation, regional security agreements may still prevent a neutral stance. For example, all members⁵⁵ of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”⁵⁶ This language is somewhat softened by Article 5 though, arguably leaving at least some room for states to make individual decisions concerning participation in hostilities. Article 5 says that each member state “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking...such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”⁵⁷ By allowing each state to take such action as it deems necessary, there may be some wiggle room for individual NATO states to stay out of a particular conflict without breaching their NATO obligations.\n\nIn addition to NATO, there are many other collective security agreements that may limit a state’s neutrality options. For example, the United States has committed to the collective defense of nearly thirty countries outside of NATO. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a collective security agreement that covers armed attacks in the Pacific Area.⁵⁸ The United States has bilateral security agreements with Japan,⁵⁹ South Korea,⁶⁰ and the Philippines⁶¹ that all address armed attacks in the Pacific against either party. The Southeast Asia Treaty between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Thailand, says all states will collectively respond to armed attacks in the treaty area as determined by their own “constitutional processes.”⁶² The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) between 22 North, Central, and South American states says that each signatory nation will “undertake to assist” in meeting\n\nand Neutrality, 33 VAND.

    "an armed attack against another signatory nation.⁶³ Additionally, while not officially recognizing Taiwan as an independent state, the United States has continually expressed its commitment to defend Taiwan.⁶⁴\n\nWhile the United States has collective security agreements that span the globe and appears destined for belligerency in just about any future IAC, not all states have such widespread commitments. Additionally, aside from the United Nations, most collective security agreements are based on geographic regions, typically only requiring states to give up a neutrality posture when the conflict creeps into their neighborhood. After all, with traditional methods of warfare would it really matter whether Costa Rica is willing to allow convoys of troops or munitions to cross its territory in support of an armed conflict in Europe? With the interconnected nature of global networks and the development of offensive cyber tools, all of a sudden Costa Rica’s stance on a distant European or Asian conflict could become relevant. If neutrality rights and obligations extend to activities in cyberspace, regional security agreements will do very little to eliminate neutrality issues because with global information networks, every state is in the same neighborhood. While the UN Security Council could theoretically require all states to give up a neutrality posture with respect to a particular conflict, practical limitations make it unlikely. So, if all future armed conflicts are going to have at least some neutrals, and all future conflicts will involve cyber operations,⁶⁵ how, if at all, do neutrality rules affect activities in cyberspace?\n\n## C. Applying Neutrality Rules in Cyberspace\n\nEven though the Hague V and XIII rules are over a hundred years old, today they provide the basic framework for applying neutrality concepts to activities in cyberspace. There may not be universal international agreement in applying fundamental principles of international law to activities in cyberspace but the United States’ position is that existing international law does apply in cyberspace.⁶⁶ Additionally, the International Court of Justice has suggested that neutrality rules apply to all weapon systems.⁶⁷\n\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71",
    "While the 1907 neutrality rules are not a perfect fit for most cyber activities, they lead to rational conclusions when applied through a purpose-based lens. The preamble of the Hague V does not define the purpose, merely stating the desire to define “more clearly the rights and duties of neutral Powers in case of war on land.”68 The preamble of Hague XIII is similarly void of a clear purpose statement.69 Generically, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve state’s political and territorial sovereignty. More specifically however, the purpose of neutrality is to preserve a state’s ability to choose if and when to enter an armed conflict and to minimize the spread of conflict and its harmful effects.70 This ultimate purpose is reflected in the policy of United States. The United States Navy handbook for the law of naval operations says “[t]he law of neutrality serves to localize war, to limit the conduct of war on both land and sea, and to lessen the impact of war on international commerce.”71 When applying the neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace they must be viewed through this purpose-based lens of limiting the spread of conflict.\n\nWhile a full analysis of how the use of force and armed attack thresholds under the United Nations Charter apply in cyberspace is beyond the scope of this article, a purpose-based analysis of the neutrality rules relies on the premise that nations can legitimately exercise self-defense rights in the face of certain malicious cyber activities. First, most scholars agree that activities in cyber space can constitute a use of force or an armed attack.72 Professor Michael Schmitt, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is a leading scholar in this area and has advocated a consequence-based approach. He argues that if a malicious cyber activity has similar destructive consequences of a conventional attack then it is mainly a matter of severity in deciding whether the use of force threshold or armed attack threshold has been crossed.73 The United States has apparently adopted a similar view. In September 2012, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the State Department, stated “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would\n\n88 (July 8) (“The Court finds that as in the case of the principles of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict, international law leaves no doubt that the principle of neutrality, whatever its content, which is of a fundamental character similar to that of the humanitarian principles and rules, is applicable (subject to the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter), to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used.”).\n\n68 See Hague V, supra note 10, Preamble.\n\n69 See Hague XIII, supra note 25, Preamble.\n\n70 Georgios C.

    "likely be viewed as a use of force.”⁷⁴ Koh went on to say “[a] State’s national right of self-defense, recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter, may be triggered by computer network activities that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat thereof.”⁷⁵ While it is unclear to what extent the international community embraces the ability to assert self-defense rights in response to a malicious cyber activity,⁷⁶ with the United States taking an unequivocal position and NATO suggesting a similar stance,⁷⁷ others may follow.\n\nIt is a state’s ability to assert self-defense rights under Article 51 of the UN Charter that is so important to the neutrality analysis. If the whole purpose of neutrality is to prevent the spread of war and belligerents can legitimately assert self-defense rights in response to malicious cyber activity, then when a belligerent routes malicious cyber code through a neutral state’s infrastructure on the way to the enemy it threatens the stability that the neutrality rules seek to uphold. Unfettered use of a neutral state’s infrastructure for malicious cyber operations raises a significant risk that the neutral state will be dragged into the conflict as the victim state seeks to defend itself. In order to achieve its purpose, the neutrality rules need to apply to all military actions that are likely to trigger defensive measures.\n\nIt also makes sense for neutrality rules to apply to this situation when viewed from an incentives perspective. In the absence of governing neutrality rules, a belligerent could find great strategic value in bringing a neutral party into a conflict. One way to get a state to abandon neutrality might be to route destructive cyber code through that neutral country, thereby pressuring an opposing belligerent to take action against the neutral’s infrastructure. When portions of the neutral state’s infrastructure suddenly shut down or other military operations start affecting day-to-day life in that neutral state, political will to join the conflict could increase. Alternatively, if the defender chooses not to engage the neutral state’s infrastructure, the attacker may gain an operational safe haven. For the attacking belligerent, this is a win-win situation that uses a neutral’s territory to gain a strategic advantage.\n\nIn light of these incentives, the neutrality rules should be interpreted as granting rights and imposing duties in cyberspace if the text allows for such an interpretation. However, one clear limitation in the text concerns territorial borders. Even if the rules can be interpreted to apply to cyber activity, the territorial limitations\n\n⁷⁴ Koh Comments, *supra* note 66.\n\n⁷⁵ *Id.*\n\n⁷⁶ See generally Lt Col. Patrick W.

    "stressed in Hague V will still serve as distinct boundaries in the analysis. The drafters of Hague V specifically considered and rejected the idea of extending a neutral state’s duties to areas where it exercises jurisdiction outside of its sovereign territory.⁷⁸ In the cyber context, undersea communication cables or communication satellites would therefore always fall outside the scope of any neutrality analysis. However, within a neutral’s territory, the Hague V rules allow for reasonable interpretations concerning their applicability to malicious cyber activities. Articles 2–4 offer the strongest arguments for applying neutrality rules in cyberspace while Article 8 stands as the main counter argument.\n\nThe key language in Article 2 is “convoy” of “munitions.”⁷⁹ The Oxford dictionary defines a convoy as “a group of ships or vehicles travelling together, typically one accompanied by armed troops, warships, or other vehicles for protection.”⁸⁰ The official report of Hague V arguably elaborates on what is meant by the term “convoy” by distinguishing the prohibition in Article 2 with the permissible activity in Article 7. Article 7 says “[a] neutral State is not called upon to prevent the export or transport, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything which can be of use to an army or a fleet.”⁸¹ The key distinction between Article 2 and Article 7 is the identity of the transporter. If the transporter is a belligerent, then Article 2 acts as a complete bar. If the transporter is anyone else, Article 7 applies.⁸² The thrust of the Article 7 rationale is to limit the harmful economic effects of war on a neutral state and its population.⁸³ In the cyber context, the key then is determining the identity of the transporter. Is it the belligerent typing commands that cause the malicious code to take certain paths through the infrastructure of a neutral state or is it the telecommunications service provider whose physical cables or towers transmit bits of information from node to node? Here, the neutral state’s network infrastructure is analogous to its roads. If a belligerent drives a convoy of munitions over the roads of a neutral state there is a clear violation of Article 2, even though the neutral state built the roads, decided which directions they will run, how to manage traffic congestion, and whether or how much to charge in tolls. A physical communication network looks very much the same. The service provider laid the cable or built the towers, created particular routes, established various traffic control mechanisms, and may charge a toll for passing traffic over its network. This interpretation is in line with the economic motive behind Article 7. Any economic gain to a service provider in allowing a belligerent to “hire its transport services” is more closely analogous to paying a road toll than hiring truck drivers or shipping companies to transport crates of munitions. Because the goal of Article 7 is to prevent harmful economic impacts to neutral\n\n⁷⁸ Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 541.\n⁷⁹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2.\n⁸⁰ OXFORD DICTIONARY available at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/convoy.\n⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 7.\n⁸² Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 539.\n⁸³ Id. at 542.\n\nCyber Neutrality 83",
    "states, it should not encompass cyber transport activity, which at most brings only negligible economic gain.\n\nThe prohibition in Article 3 also tends to support the application of neutrality rules to cyber operations, although the focus shifts from munitions to communications. The main thrust of Article 3 is to prohibit belligerents from erecting on a neutral's territory “a wireless telegraphy station or any other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with [the] belligerent forces.”84 The official report from the Hague conferences explains that Article 3 is focused on “installation by belligerent parties of stations or apparatus on the territory of the neutral State.”85 Clearly, this language envisions the establishment of physical infrastructure on a neutral's territory. However, it would be odd for the functional equivalent of a wireless telegraphy station to be excluded. Arguably, one of the main reasons for this provision is that military communication lines are legitimate, and often very important, military targets.86 If belligerents were allowed to shield command and control targets by virtually placing them within a neutral's territory, an enemy would be forced to either violate that neutral's territory or suffer potentially decisive disadvantages. Modern technology allows for virtual communication stations that could physically reside on any computer connected to the Internet. Virtual communication stations would be equally valid for targeting purposes as a brick and mortar station, although the proportionality analysis may be more difficult if it is a dual use target.87 If Article 3 only prohibits the establishment of physical communication stations, a belligerent is forced to choose between violating neutrality and suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages. From this perspective, Article 3 should be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment of virtual communication stations within a neutral's territory in the same way it prohibits physical communication stations.\n\nArticle 4's prohibition on forming \"corps of combatants\"88 in a neutral state should also extend to the cyber domain. The rationale again comes back to the purpose of the neutrality rules and the right of a belligerent to attack legitimate military targets. The official report clarifies that it is the \"formation of a corps of combatants to assist a belligerent\" that is prohibited. Article 4 appears to focus on the creation of a militia-like force in a neutral territory.89 The term \"combatant\" makes it more difficult to apply Article 4 in the cyber context than Articles 2 or 3. Articles 2 and 3 are focused on objects, such as convoys and communication centers, which are easier to translate into the cyber domain. Article 4 is directed a specific group of people who qualify as combatants. There is no functional equivalent of\n\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71\n\n84 Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n85 Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 540.\n86 ARMY OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK, supra note 11, Ch. 2 para.

Hague V, supra note 10, art. 6.",
    "an individual person in cyberspace. However, in the aggregate, a botnet army may have fair comparisons to a “corps of combatants” in certain situations. Both are organized, have a chain of command, execute the orders of superiors, and can cause appreciable harm to an enemy in carrying out those orders. If both a botnet army and a corps of combatants can accomplish similar military objectives, Article 4 should apply equally to both groups. An enemy belligerent needs to have the same ability to fend off attacks from digital armies as it does human armies, at least to the extent that digital armies can inflict comparable harm. If the goal is to prevent the spread of conflict by localizing war, neither human nor digital armies can have a legal safe haven in neutral states.\n\nWhile Articles 2–4 allow for reasonable arguments concerning their applicability to cyber operations, Article 8 offers the strongest support for the counter argument. Article 8 does not require neutral states to forbid belligerents to use “telegraph or telephone cables” or any “wireless telegraphy apparatus.”90 Importantly, the text of Article 8 is entirely focused on the neutral state and does not grant any rights to belligerents. In theory, a neutral state certainly could prohibit the use of its communication networks by a belligerent without implicating Article 8. However, the practical difficulties of enforcing such a prohibition would be difficult at best. The Hague report explains that the focus of Article 8 is “the transmission of news,” comparing it to a public service.91 At the time, communication networks had very limited capability. Communicating information was all these early networks could do. Today’s network capabilities far exceed the scope of what the drafters of Article 8 likely meant by “the transmission of news” in 1907. While technically speaking, today’s networks are still transmitting information in the form of bits and bytes, informing (or misinforming) a human mind on the other end is no longer the sole purpose. The reach of today’s automated networks, and automated systems attached to networks, drastically increases the range of achievable effects by merely transmitting information from point A to point B. When the transmission of information has the ability to directly cause physical damage in the real world, Article 8 is no longer merely shielding the flow of information that may be used in planning an attack on the enemy, it is shielding the attack itself.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, because Article 8 does not convey any rights to belligerents, a belligerent’s ability to invoke Article 51 rights against a neutral state from which malicious cyber operations are emanating may entice neutral states to prohibit belligerents from using their networks at all. However, due to the attribution problems in cyberspace, neutral states may have significant enforcement difficulties in applying an ad hoc approach. Interpreting the rules to place the duty on all belligerents from the outset has the advantages of uniformity and predictability, even if attribution and enforcement problems remain.\n\nCyber Neutrality 85",
    "In order to achieve the purpose of the neutrality rules, belligerents should not be able to exploit the network infrastructure of neutral states. Since the key language of Hague V in Articles 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, allow for reasonable application to cyber operations, they should be interpreted broadly where doing so is necessary to limit the spread of conflict.\n\n## III. ATTRIBUTION: LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE\n\nMeaningful application of neutrality rules requires an enforcement mechanism, especially when gray areas in the law allow for reasonable minds to differ. This part will discuss the international standards of state attribution and briefly analyze some of the practical problems they create for enforcement of neutrality rules in cyberspace. In laying out the standards of state responsibility, this part will first address several legal theories of attribution articulated in the Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and discuss two key International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions that deal with the factual application of attribution theories. Next, this part will briefly discuss some of the technological features of modern networks that create hurdles in applying these standards to cyber activities.\n\n## A. Legal Theories of State Responsibility\n\nThe purpose of the Draft Articles is to codify “the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of states for their internationally wrongful acts.”92 Attributing an act to a state has two key components: a valid legal theory of attribution and identification of the actor. Articles 4 through 11 of the Draft Articles contain different legal theories of attribution, all of which could be applied in the cyber context. However, this section will focus on Articles 4, 5, 7, and 8.\n\nArticle 4 of the Draft Articles is the most direct legal theory of attribution. It holds a state responsible for the actions of “any State organ,” which includes “any person or entity.”93\n\nArticle 5 extends responsibility to the state when the state has empowered a non-state organ by law to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”94 Entities empowered by a state would include publicly or state owned companies.95 If those public companies are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, then their actions are attributable to the state. Border control is a typical state function. If a government owned information service provider has\n\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71",
    "been empowered by law to conduct digital border inspections, any internationally wrongful actions it takes while performing that border control function are arguably attributable to the state.\n\nThese actions are attributable to the state even if the entity exceeds its authority or directly contravenes state law, as articulated in Article 7.⁹⁶ Article 7’s extension of state responsibility to unauthorized acts applies to both a state organ and to an entity empowered by state law. It prevents a state from taking “refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form.”⁹⁷\n\nArticle 8 of the Draft Articles states an important theory of attribution for cyber operations but presents difficult practical problems. Article 8 says the “conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁹⁸ A key distinction between Article 8 and Article 5 is that Article 8 requires a state law that confers authority while Article 5 applies to less formal ties between the state and the actor.⁹⁹ Article 8 applies where “individuals or groups of private individuals who, though not specifically commissioned by the State and not forming part of its police or armed forces, are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as ‘volunteers’ to neighboring countries, or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad.”¹⁰⁰ Article 8 encompasses the direction or control standard reflected in the ICJ’s holding in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua case. In that case, Nicaragua attempted to hold the United States responsible for various humanitarian violations committed by an organized anti-government group.¹⁰¹ While the ICJ found that the United States had trained, equipped, supplied, and financed these anti-government groups, there was no evidence that the United States directed or controlled the particular humanitarian violations alleged.¹⁰² The court stated that for the United States to be held liable for the particular humanitarian violations “it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹⁰³ However, the court did hold that “the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities…has acted…\n\n⁹⁶ Id. at art. 7.\n⁹⁷ Id. at art. 7 commentary, para. 2.\n⁹⁸ Id. at art. 8.\n⁹⁹ Id. at art. 5 commentary, para. 7.\n¹⁰⁰ Id. at art. 8 commentary, para. 2.\n¹⁰¹ See ICJ Nicaragua Case, supra 39, at 6.\n¹⁰² Id. at 315.\n¹⁰³ Id. at 115.\n\nCyber Neutrality 87",
    "in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.”¹⁰⁴\n\nThe commentary to Article 8 suggests that a state will be liable when it either actually participates in the operation or gives specific directions concerning the operation.¹⁰⁵ In applying this standard to operations in cyberspace, the general funding, training, or supplying of non-state entities who are engaged in malicious cyber activity might constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle but would not amount to directing or controlling specific operations. Directing specific types of malicious cyber activities against specific targets, would likely meet the direction or control threshold with respect to the end result, but it might not meet the direction or control threshold for the manner of delivery. This could lead to a situation where a state directed or controlled a specific act because of its involvement in the specific malicious software and the choosing of targets, but did not direct or control its delivery through a neutral state.\n\nAnother theory of attribution with particular relevance to cyber operations is based on the ICJ’s rationale in the Corfu Channel case. This theory would be included under Article 4 of the Draft Articles as “conduct” of a state organ. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ held Albania liable for failing to warn British ships of the presence of mines in its territorial waters.¹⁰⁶ The court reasoned that Albania’s knowledge of the presence of the mines, regardless of who put them there, established liability.¹⁰⁷ Importantly, there was no direct evidence of Albania’s knowledge. The court was willing to infer knowledge, provided the inferences left “no room for reasonable doubt.”¹⁰⁸ The court was careful to state that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.”¹⁰⁹ The court relied on strong evidence that Albania continuously kept a close watch over its territorial waters in the Corfu Channel and the laying of mines in those waters would have likely been discovered by Albanian authorities.¹¹⁰ This theory is particularly enticing in the cyber context, especially when a government exercises tight control over its information networks, and is frequently cited by authors as a potential partial solution to the attribution problem.¹¹¹\n\n¹⁰⁴ ICJ Nicaragua Case, at 146.\n\n¹⁰⁵ Draft Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 92, art. 8 commentary, para. 3-4.\n\n¹⁰⁶ Corfu Channel Case, supra note 37.\n\n¹⁰⁷ Id. at 18.\n\n¹⁰⁸ Id. at 18.\n\n¹⁰⁹ Id. at 18.\n\n¹¹⁰ Id. at 18-20.\n\n¹¹¹ See, e.g., Scott J.

    "B. Technical and Human Attribution\n\nAttribution is most appropriately divided into two subcategories: technical attribution and human attribution. Technical attribution is tracing the physical path of the code to the computer at its source. Human attribution is identifying the person operating the computer. In reality, only the human attribution aspect is necessary to apply a legal theory of attribution but because of the ability to mask identity on the Internet, it may be impossible to conclusively establish human attribution without combining the technical component. Additionally, strong evidence of technical attribution may allow for an inference of knowledge based on Corfu Channel's rationale, especially where a state organ exercises significant control over Internet traffic and infrastructure.\n\nTechnical attribution is a significant challenge in applying any legal standard to cyber operations. The Internet's design encompasses a fundamental tradeoff, choosing the free flow of information over security. At times, U.S. government officials have called for the design of a new version of the Internet for critical infrastructure that primarily focuses on security.[112] A more secure Internet would likely make technical attribution easier but until one is developed, sophisticated cyber operators will continue to exploit the anonymity offered by the current version.\n\nThe ability to technically attribute an action in cyberspace may significantly depend on the type of activity. When information flows across the Internet it is broken down into several smaller packets.[113] Each packet contains a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address, a source IP address, and a portion of the message.[114] Each packet is sent from the source computer to an initial router. The initial router reads the destination address and forwards the packet to another router until the packet eventually reaches the destination address.[115]\n\nOne of the concerns with technical attribution relates to the source address, which may be faked or \"spoofed.\"[116] While this is legitimate issue, it does not apply to all malicious cyber activities. If the sender wants to receive any information back from the destination address, then the source address contained in the packet must lead back to the sender, even if not directly.[117] While many malicious cyber activities will seek a response, a DDoS attack can be carried out without seeking\n\nCyber Neutrality",
    "a response.¹¹⁸ When the sender’s IP address is spoofed, tracing the source may not even be possible.¹¹⁹\n\nWhen the source IP address is not spoofed, technical attribution remains a challenge, even if it may be technically possible. A common technique to frustrate attribution is the use of proxies.¹²⁰ Proxies are intermediaries that perform various technical functions for a customer before a message is sent to a destination.¹²¹ Proxies frustrate attribution because they replace the source IP address of all packets with their own IP address.¹²² Some proxies are designed solely for the purpose of preserving anonymity¹²³ and depending on the geographic location of the proxy server, gaining cooperation from its owner/operator, at least through judicial means, may not be possible.\n\nOnion routing is another technique that complicates attribution even when the source IP address is not spoofed. Onion routing is basically a process where a message goes through several intermediaries before it reaches its recipient.¹²⁴ However, what makes onion routing unique is that each layer of the transmission is fully encrypted, including the source address, destination address, and contents of the message.¹²⁵ Each router is only able to decrypt the address of the next router and is therefore unaware of the source, contents, or ultimate destination.¹²⁶ Tor is a publicly available onion routing service¹²⁷ and is commonly used by militaries, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement personnel, among others.¹²⁸ Further complicating matters, various “anonymizing” techniques can be combined and each technique can have multiple steps.¹²⁹\n\nDespite the availability of these sophisticated techniques, security firms continue to claim success in tracing the origins of various malicious cyber activities. In February 2013, Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, released a report tracing systematic hacking efforts dating back to 2006 to hundreds of IP addresses\n\n¹¹⁸ Id. at 537-38.\n¹¹⁹ Id. at 537.\n¹²⁰ W.

    "registered in China.¹³⁰ According to the report, Chinese hackers frequently hijacked third party computers, using tools such as Remote Desktop, before hacking the target computers.¹³¹ However, Mandiant claims to have traced the link between the hacker and the hijacked computer in 1,905 instances from January 2011 to January 2013.¹³² The connection was traced to 832 IP addresses, 817 of which were registered in China and mainly belonged to one of four large blocks of IP addresses that service Shanghai.¹³³ Chinese authorities have boisterously denied responsibility, calling Mandiant’s report “irresponsible and unprofessional.”¹³⁴ Technical aspects alone should probably not conclusively establish an origination point. As discussed earlier, various techniques allow hackers to mask their true location. Could it be, as Chinese authorities seem to suggest,¹³⁵ that hackers outside of China are masking their attacks as originating from China? The Mandiant report did not solely rely on technical analysis. In fact, it combined significant human attribution techniques and other non-technical data to paint a comprehensive picture. For example, two of the four large blocks of IP addresses identified by Mandiant serviced the same area where Chinese Military Unit 61398 is headquartered.¹³⁶ According to the report, independent information suggested that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations that specifically target English speaking countries.¹³⁷ The remote desktop intrusions were driven by a Chinese virtual keyboard layout setting in 97% of the identified intrusions.¹³⁸ The report even identifies several hackers by name through various techniques, such as when hackers logged into their personnel Facebook accounts through the same command and control infrastructure they used to infiltrate intermediary systems.¹³⁹ In this case, it is the sheer volume of evidence, both technical and human, that seem to reliably attribute the source.\n\nHowever, even without the human attribution evidence, an attribution argument based on Corfu Channel’s rationale in this case is persuasive. The Chinese government exercises significant control over its communication networks, including cell phones, e-mail, and Internet access.¹⁴⁰ Additionally, because the telecommunica\n\n¹³⁰ See Mandiant, APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, at pg.2-6, available at http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf [hereinafter Mandiant Report].\n¹³¹ Id. at 39-40.\n¹³² Id. at 40.\n¹³³ Id.\n¹³⁴ David E.

    "tions industry in China is state-owned,¹⁴¹ it would be difficult to argue it did not at least have knowledge of the intrusions.¹⁴² Under Corfu Channel, knowledge coupled with the failure to warn or take other adequate measures to prevent harm, is in itself an internationally wrongful act, regardless of who actually controls the computer.¹⁴³\n\n## C. Attributing Conduct for Neutrality Purposes\n\nEven if attribution is possible for sustained and systematic hacking by a Chinese military unit, it may be very difficult to attribute isolated incidents that could implicate neutrality concerns. However, the utility of an isolated incident might be questionable. The effective deployment of malicious software that could have militarily significant results would likely require extensive intelligence gathering. The intelligence gathering phase of a cyber operation typically requires the same or similar access as the deployment stage. Additionally, because of routine software updates or patches, without continuous monitoring of the target system, the operation has a high risk of failure.\n\nAnother practical attribution issue is that a neutral country may not have the same incentive to duplicate Mandiant’s rigorous investigative efforts. While belligerents will be highly motivated to discover the source of malicious cyber activity, many neutral states may determine that effective monitoring costs significantly outweigh the benefits, at least until belligerents threaten to expand the battlefield into its territory.\n\n## IV. CASE STUDIES\n\nWhile there has not yet been an armed conflict between the countries with the most advanced cyber forces, cyber capabilities continue to develop and are increasingly incorporated by military planners. This part will analyze the neutrality implications of different types of cyber operations by looking at several recently reported uses of malicious cyber capabilities. While some of these examples did actually raise neutrality issues, this part will hypothetically build on these examples in order to better explore various legal boundaries.\n\n¹⁴¹ Keith Bradsher, *China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders*, N.Y.

    "A. Estonia\n\n1. Background\n\nThe 2007 network intrusions in Estonia demonstrated how disruptive a coordinated cyber campaign can be on a society that is heavily dependent on modern technology. By 2007, Estonia had become one of the most technologically dependent countries in the world. Electronic banking accounted for 95% of all banking operations, 98% of its territory had Internet access, and many government services and functions were primarily conducted online.¹⁴⁴ In April of 2007, political tensions rose between Estonia and Russia after Estonian officials decided to remove a Soviet-era WWII memorial.¹⁴⁵ The decision resulted in local riots in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, mainly among ethnic Russians.¹⁴⁶ Between April 27th and May 18th, Estonia was the victim of numerous malicious and disruptive cyber activities, mainly consisting of website defacement and denial of service (DoS) attacks.¹⁴⁷ These disruptive cyber activities had significant economic and societal effects.¹⁴⁸ While some of the intrusions were traced to IP addresses registered in Moscow, including government institutions, the Russian government denied any involvement and many of the intrusions involved computers from 178 different countries.¹⁴⁹\n\n2. Neutrality Analysis\n\nBecause these intrusions into Estonia’s networks did not occur during the course of an armed conflict, and did not trigger an armed conflict, they did not raise any formal neutrality issues. However, at least one author has argued that these intrusions collectively could have amounted to an illegal use of force.¹⁵⁰ While Estonia did not invoke NATO’s collective defense measures, it is not difficult to imagine a similar cyber operation escalating into an armed conflict or taking place as part of an ongoing conventional armed conflict where formal neutrality rights and obligations would apply.\n\nIf the cyber activity in Estonia had escalated to an armed conflict it would have raised significant neutrality issues. Of the 178 countries whose infrastructure was reportedly involved in the intrusions,¹⁵¹ it is likely that at least some of them would want to take a neutral stance.\n\n¹⁴⁴ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska, Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* 17-18 (2010).\n\n¹⁴⁵ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 15.\n\n¹⁴⁶ *Id.* at 15.\n\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.* at 18-21.\n\n¹⁴⁸ *Id.* at 24-25.\n\n¹⁴⁹ *Id.* at 23.\n\n¹⁵⁰ Schmitt, *supra* note 73, at 577.\n\n¹⁵¹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 23.\n\nCyber Neutrality 93",
    "Most of the malicious cyber activity against Estonia was aimed at denying access, either in the form of DoS attacks or various attacks on Domain Name Servers (DNS).¹⁵² This type of malicious cyber activity is not likely to cause permanent damage to a network or systems on a network and mainly has the effect of hindering information flow. In the context of an armed conflict, belligerents might use this type of capability to help protect conventional forces during an attack by limiting an enemy’s ability to effectively communicate. DoS attacks could therefore arguably provide capabilities comparable to electronic jamming systems.\n\nFor example, the United States Navy uses the EA-6B as an airborne jamming system to suppress enemy air defenses.¹⁵³ The EA-6B is mainly used as a support element of tactical strike packages by disrupting the enemy’s electronic signals and allowing strike aircraft or ground troops to hit designated targets with minimal resistance.¹⁵⁴ Another example is the U.S. Army’s use of cell phone jammers in Afghanistan. The Army uses mobile jamming systems that emit powerful radio signals that drown out all other signals over a particular area.¹⁵⁵ While preventing remote Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonations is one of the primary uses of these cell phone jamming systems,¹⁵⁶ they can also be used to support offensive operations by blacking out cell signals in a particular area during an attack.\n\nThere is no doubt that positioning an EA-6B or a mobile cell phone jamming system in a neutral country would violate that neutral country’s rights.¹⁵⁷ What about a comparable cyber capability? The difference with the cyber capability is that a DoS attack simultaneously comes from so many different places, as illustrated in the Estonia situation. The three options would be to say that neutrality rules do not govern this type of activity at all, they govern every aspect of the activity, or they govern certain parts of the activity.\n\nBecause the purpose of neutrality rules is to prevent the spread of conflict,¹⁵⁸ exempting all DoS attacks from neutrality rules is an unsatisfying option. It would put belligerents in the delicate position of choosing between granting safe havens or taking defensive measures that could convince neutral countries to ally themselves with opposing forces.

    "every computer participating in a DoS attack would be nearly impossible to enforce. Additionally, not all computers participating in a DoS attack carry the same risk of spreading a conflict. A belligerent suffering a debilitating DoS attack in conjunction with a physical attack is much more likely to attack the computers that are controlling a botnet, the command and control node, than the enslaved computers that are merely following orders. Identifying the command and control node may be technically difficult but belligerents are unlikely to expend limited defensive resources unless they are likely to have the desired military effect. For example, using a military option to disable one of the 10,000 enslaved computers will not do much to stop a DoS attack, but focusing a military option against a command and control node could stop the attack altogether.\n\nBy applying the neutrality rules only to the activity of the command and control nodes instead of all computers participating in the DoS attack, the purpose of the neutrality rules can be harmonized with some of the practical realities of cyber capabilities. Under this approach, belligerents would be prohibited from using command and control nodes that are geographically located in a neutral country, but not necessarily prohibited from enlisting individual computers in a neutral country to participate in a DoS attack. If a military option could realistically disable all computers participating in the DoS attack, consistent with other LOAC principles, then the neutrality rules should apply to the use of those individual computers as well. As soon as persons or objects within a neutral state become legitimate military targets, the neutrality rules become a vital tool to help limit the spread of conflict.\n\nIn Estonia, the DoS attacks apparently began more or less as an unorganized cyber protest but evolved into an organized and sophisticated attack that suggested “central command and control.”¹⁵⁹ If this DoS attack had occurred during an armed conflict, it is the location of the command and control nodes that would be most important in conducting the neutrality analysis but there may be situations where the location of the individual computers is important as well. For example, if many of the individual computers participating in a DoS attack were co-located, military options specifically targeting those individual computers might become more realistic.\n\nB. Georgia\n\n1. Background\n\nWhile the Estonia situation raised many interesting hypothetical situations concerning the applicability of neutrality rules to activities in cyberspace, the Georgia situation in 2008 actually raised neutrality issues. The key distinction in Georgia was that the cyber activity occurred in conjunction with a conventional armed conflict between Russia and Georgia.¹⁶⁰ On August 8, 2008, Russian military\n\n¹⁵⁹ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, supra note 144, at 23.\n¹⁶⁰ Id. at 67.\n\nCyber Neutrality 95",
    "forces entered Georgian territory, claiming a need to protect Russian citizens abroad from hostile action by the Georgian military.¹⁶¹ In response to Russian aggression, Georgia mobilized military forces and declared a state of war.¹⁶² Various malicious cyber activities against Georgian governmental websites also began on August 8,¹⁶³ although the Russian government denied all involvement in the cyber activities.¹⁶⁴ While Georgian society was much less dependent on the Internet than Estonian society, various governmental organizations heavily relied on websites to disseminate information.¹⁶⁵ The malicious cyber activity closely paralleled the activity against Estonia a year earlier, mainly consisting of DoS attacks and defacement of public websites.¹⁶⁶ The sites specifically targeted included the Georgian President’s website, the central government’s website, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website, and the Ministry of Defense’s website.¹⁶⁷ As in Estonia, the malicious cyber activity originated from all over the world, and was likely carried out by one or more botnets.¹⁶⁸ However, at least one command and control server was traced to an IP address in Turkey.¹⁶⁹\n\nAnother important aspect of the Georgia situation concerns the assistance Georgia received from third parties. Tulip Systems, a private web hosting company based in Atlanta, Georgia, apparently reached out to Georgian government officials after the DoS attacks started and offered to host various government websites.¹⁷⁰ Tulip Systems took these actions without any apparent authorization from the United States Government.¹⁷¹ The company offered assistance in order to “‘protect’ the nation of Georgia’s Internet sites from malicious traffic.”¹⁷² After hosting several key Georgian websites, Tulips Systems was subsequently the target of several DoS attacks.¹⁷³\n\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71",

Shortly after the conflict ended, the Turkish Prime minister stated:\n\n&gt; It would not be right for Turkey to be pushed toward any side. Certain circles want to push Turkey into a corner either with the United States or Russia after the Georgian incident. One of the sides is our closest ally, the United States. The other side is Russia, with which we have an important trade volume. We would act in the line with what Turkey’s national interests require.¹⁷⁵\n\nThese statements by the Turkish Prime Minister suggest that Turkey did not want to take sides and may have officially declared neutrality had the conflict lasted longer. However, with at least one botnet’s command and control server apparently residing in Turkey,¹⁷⁶ Turkish sovereign territory may have played a significant role in the cyber portion of the conflict. Assuming Georgia, or any of its allies, could identify the command and control server in Turkey during the DoS attack, what were Georgia’s options? What if the DoS attack was hindering Georgian forces ability to communicate and mount an effective defense against invading Russian forces? Georgian forces would have been in a difficult position, potentially having to choose between taking military action against servers residing in a neutral state or simply accepting the degraded communications environment. This is precisely the type of conundrum the neutrality rules seek to avoid. By treating the command and control server as a neutrality violation, Turkey has an obligation to take necessary action to shut it down if it wants to remain neutral.¹⁷⁷ From Turkey’s point of view, treating this as a neutrality violation probably also helps with the complicated political balancing act. Turkey can shut down the command and control server in the name of neutrality and avoid the perception that it is taking sides in the conflict. If the neutrality rules do not apply, any decision Turkey makes may be perceived as taking a side in the conflict. If it shuts down the server, Russia may perceive Turkey\n\n---\n\n¹⁷⁴ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 68.\n\n¹⁷⁵ Igor Torbakov, *The Georgia Crisis and Russia-Turkey Relations*, *THE JAMESTOWN FOUNDATION*, at 20 (2008), available at http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/GeorgiaCrisisTorbakov.pdf.\n\n¹⁷⁶ Tikk, Kaska, Vihul, *supra* note 144, at 70.\n\n¹⁷⁷ Hague V, *supra* note 10, art. 5.",
    "as taking Georgia’s side, while if it leaves the server up and running, Georgia may perceive Turkey as taking Russia’s side.\n\nWhat about attribution? How can Georgia, Turkey or any other interested party know whether Russian forces are operating the command and control server? The reality may be that they cannot know with much certainty, at least not in real time. But does it really matter? Georgia’s right to take defensive action against the server does not depend on positively identifying the operator, although the manner in which it exercises that right probably does. While it is true that civilians and civilian objects are protected by the law of armed conflict, civilians may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities¹⁷⁸ and civilian objects become military objects when used to effectively contribute to military action.¹⁷⁹ From Georgia’s perspective, DoS attacks that begin just as Russia invades and inhibit vital communications are arguably making an effective contribution to military action. Georgia may not be able to target specific personnel without additional attribution facts, but it likely could target the object performing a command and control function for a debilitating DoS attack. Any Georgian response would only be subject to a proper proportionality analysis. Depending on how Georgia conducts its proportionality analysis, it might choose to disable the command and control server with cyber tools or conventional weapons, but either option could theoretically be justified under the law of armed conflict. When the law of armed conflict would allow for a belligerent to take military action against persons or objects in a neutral country, the neutrality rules have to apply if the concept of neutrality is to survive modern warfare.\n\nFurthermore, Hague V textually supports interpreting these command and control servers as constituting neutrality violations. Both Article 2¹⁸⁰ and Article 3¹⁸¹ could arguably apply to command and control servers but Article 3 is a better fit. A command and control server is closely analogous to a “wireless telegraphy station.” The command and control server is used to send and receive messages in much the same way as a telegraphy station would send and receive messages. Additionally, command and control servers clearly communicate with belligerent “forces.” Article 2 is specifically directed at convoys of troops or munitions but Article 3 uses the broader term “forces.” Even if reasonable minds could differ on whether the individual computers performing the DoS attack are “forces” within the\n\n¹⁷⁸ See Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art 51, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n\n¹⁷⁹ Id. at art. 52.\n\n¹⁸⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 2 (“Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power.”).\n\n¹⁸¹ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3 (stating that “[b]elligerents are likewise forbidden: (a) To erect on the territory of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea; (b) To use any installation of this kind established by them before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages.”).\n\n98 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71",
    "meaning of Hague V, the command and control server is also communicating with the person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet. The command and control server has to receive instructions on targets, timing, and duration of the attack that it then sends out to all of the individual computers that make up the botnet. The person or persons ultimately controlling the botnet would likely qualify as a belligerent force, even if only as an unprivileged belligerent force not formally associated with a military.¹⁸² The communication between this belligerent force and the command and control server would then bring the activity within the purview of Article 3.\n\n## (b) United States' Neutrality\n\nThe second main cyber neutrality issue raised by the Russian-Georgian conflict concerns the ability for well-intentioned third parties to threaten their own government’s neutrality. When Tulip Systems hosted key Georgian websites in the United States it likely jeopardized the United States’ ability to remain neutral.¹⁸³ By hosting key governmental websites used for disseminating information, Tulip Systems may have allowed a belligerent to erect “a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces”¹⁸⁴ on the territory of a potentially neutral state. By not taking action to prevent the hosting of the websites, the United States government may have forfeited its right to remain neutral.¹⁸⁵\n\nSome might argue that with Russia denying responsibility for the DoS attacks combined with the inherent attribution problems of such attacks, the United States’ assistance to Georgia in this situation does not put the United States’ neutrality at risk.¹⁸⁶ While this kind of argument might be enticing from a defensive perspective for a country wishing to maintain neutrality, it could significantly undermine a country’s offensive options with respect to unlawful combatants or unprivileged combatants in the cyber domain in other conflicts. The law of armed conflict recognizes the ability to lawfully target anyone who takes part in hostilities.¹⁸⁷ In the official commentary to Additional Protocol I, the ICRC defines hostilities as “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of the armed forces.”¹⁸⁸ It goes on to say that civilians who take “part\n\n¹⁸² For example, the U.S. law defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as anyone who “has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners” or “has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” See 10 U.S.C. § 948a(7) (2009). Anyone controlling a botnet that appears to act in conjunction with invading conventional forces would almost certainly qualify as one who “has purposely and materially supported hostilities.”\n\n¹⁸³ Korns, Kasteberg, supra note 170, at 68.\n\n¹⁸⁴ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n\n¹⁸⁵ Id. at art. 5.\n\n¹⁸⁶ See Rain Ottis, Georgia 2008 and Cyber Neutrality, available at http://conflictsincyberspace.blogspot.com/2010/03/georgia-2008-and-cyber-neutrality.html.\n\n¹⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 51.\n\n¹⁸⁸ Claude Pilloud et al., CLAUDE PILLOUD ET AL., COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8\n\nCyber Neutrality 99",
    "in armed combat, either individually or as a part of a group” become “a legitimate target.”¹⁸⁹ Even if the botnet itself is not intended to cause actual harm it is arguably facilitating the harm that will be caused by the invading conventional forces and therefore could amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ It would be problematic for a state to argue on the one hand there is no way to know who is behind these DoS attacks and therefore it can render assistance without sacrificing neutrality, and then on the other hand argue this behavior constitutes direct participation in hostilities for targeting purposes in a later conflict. The better view is that when malicious cyber activity augments or enables conventional attacks in an IAC, the cyber component should be treated as belligerent activity. It may be important to sort out whether the malicious cyber activity is privileged belligerent activity or unprivileged belligerent activity in many situations, but it does not matter in the neutrality analysis.\n\n## C. Stuxnet\n\nThe previous examples mainly centered on some of the neutrality implications of DoS attacks but the military application of cyber capabilities extends beyond merely preventing access to information. The Stuxnet worm is an example of a cyber capability that can have effects that are comparable to a damage-inflicting conventional weapon, versus effects that are comparable to a damage-enabling conventional capability. Cyber capabilities that could conceivably substitute for conventional damage-inflicting weapons increase the need for applicable neutrality rules.\n\n## 1. Background\n\nOn June 17, 2010, an employee at VirusBlokAda, a small computer security firm in Belarus, read a report from a client in Iran showing that the client’s computer was continuously rebooting.¹⁹¹ The rebooting problem indicated a potential virus and employees at VirusBlokAda soon began analyzing the system for malicious software.¹⁹² They discovered a zero-day exploit in Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer.¹⁹³ Zero-day exploits are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to its designers and they are quite rare.¹⁹⁴ Software analysis later discovered that Stuxnet took advantage of several additional Windows vulnerabilities, including additional\n\nJUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, 618 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987).\n¹⁸⁹ Id.\n¹⁹⁰ See Michael N.

J. 5, 26-27 (2010).\n¹⁹¹ Kim Zetter, How Digital Detectives Deciphered Stuxnet, the Most Menacing Malware in History, WIRED, (July 11, 2011, 7), available at http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet-the-most-menacing-malware-in-history/.\n¹⁹² Id.\n¹⁹³ Id.\n¹⁹⁴ Id.\n\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 71",
    "zero-day exploits.¹⁹⁵ A few weeks later, VirusBlokAda employees reported the zero-day exploit and the malicious software to Microsoft, which later nicknamed the malicious code Stuxnet.¹⁹⁶\n\nAs software engineers worldwide began dissecting Stuxnet’s code, they discovered that it was designed to target specific industrial control software designed by Siemens, the very same software used by Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility.¹⁹⁷ Other aspects of the code, such as only targeting configurations containing 164 devices and references to a specific frequency, 1064Hz, seemed to confirm Natanz as the code’s target.¹⁹⁸ Once Stuxnet found its target, it was designed to do two things: 1) periodically speed up and slow down certain motors connected to a frequency converter, and 2) trick monitoring systems by replacing status reports and shutting off system alarms.¹⁹⁹ This allowed Stuxnet to alter the normal operation of the industrial control system without raising operator awareness.²⁰⁰\n\nIranian centrifuges, used for enriching uranium, are based off of a Pakistani design and have a reputation for being extremely temperamental, “subject to periodic, random explosion.”²⁰¹ In David Sanger’s 2012 book, *Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power*, he says Stuxnet was a joint operation named “Olympic Games” between the United States and Israel.²⁰² Sanger says Olympic Games dated back to 2006 when President George W. Bush demanded a “third option” besides letting Iran develop a nuclear weapon or starting a war with Iran.²⁰³ Stuxnet became that third option. According to Sanger, the goal was to capitalize on Iran’s volatile centrifuge design by initiating a series of apparently random centrifuge failures, with the hope that Iranian authorities would lose faith in the design, the parts, and/or their engineers.²⁰⁴\n\nOne of Stuxnet’s most intriguing aspects was its delivery. Natanz is a secure facility that is not connected to the Internet so its designers had to figure out a way to bridge the “air gap.”²⁰⁵ According to Symantec, Stuxnet was designed to spread\n\n¹⁹⁵ Nicolas Falliere et al., W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, Symantec Security Response 2 (Feb. 2011), available at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf [hereinafter, Stuxnet Dossier].\n\n¹⁹⁶ Zetter, supra note 191 (combining the file names .stub and MrxNet.sys from the software code).\n\n¹⁹⁷ Id.\n\n¹⁹⁸ Id.\n\n¹⁹⁹ Id.\n\n²⁰⁰ Id.\n\n²⁰¹ DAVID E.

    "in several different ways, including through a vulnerability in removable drives with “auto-execution” software (thumb drives) and through local area networks (LANs) via a Windows Print Spooler vulnerability.²⁰⁶ Stuxnet was designed to infect the computer systems of people with access to Natanz, who then might plug a laptop or a thumb drive into Natanz’s closed network.²⁰⁷ Additionally, each time Stuxnet infected a computer it would gather some basic information about the system, such as the machine’s internal and external IP addresses, its name, details about the operating system, and whether it contained Siemens industrial control software.²⁰⁸ Stuxnet would then report this information to a central command and control server attached to one or more domain names.²⁰⁹ Symantec identified two of these command and control servers, one in Denmark and one in Malaysia.²¹⁰ The command and control servers could directly install updated versions of Stuxnet or other files on infected machines.²¹¹ Additionally, infected computers continuously searched LANs or connected devices for updated versions of the code.²¹² This meant that so long as Natanz insiders kept connecting thumb drives and laptops to both open and closed networks, updated versions of Stuxnet would eventually infect all targeted systems.\n\nWhile Stuxnet eventually spread to 155 different countries²¹³ (as a result of an unintended programming mistake²¹⁴), Symantec says it was initially targeted at five different organizations, all with a “presence in Iran”.²¹⁵ Interestingly, the shortest time between the software compile time and initial infection time was 12 hours.²¹⁶ Such a short time between when the code was completed to when it infected a machine with an “Iranian presence” suggests that the code was initially delivered via the Internet as opposed to being covertly installed by hand.\n\n## 2. Neutrality Analysis\n\nWhile Stuxnet did not occur during an armed conflict and therefore did not directly raise any neutrality issues, it did prove an effective operational concept that will likely be used in future conflicts. As evidenced by the Estonia and Georgia\n\n²⁰⁶ Stuxnet Dossier, supra 195, at 2. Interestingly, the United States Department of Defense banned the use of thumb drives around this same time.

    "examples, military leaders are seemingly learning the value of effective cyber operations and will likely incorporate them into future war plans. With Stuxnet’s code now available for anyone to tinker with or modify, it is reasonable to assume that the next major international conflict will include malware similar to, or modeled after, Stuxnet. For example, industrial control systems, similar to the one used at Natanz, are found in petroleum refinement plants, chemical production plants, and electrical power generation and transmission plants.²¹⁷ It is fairly easy to imagine any of these plants as constituting a legitimate military target during a future armed conflict.\n\nUsing malware like Stuxnet in an armed conflict would raise at least two significant neutrality concerns: (1) the location of command and control servers and (2) delivery routes. The analysis of the command and control server issue is similar for a Stuxnet-type operation as it would be for a DoS attack but the arguments are stronger. Stuxnet used at least two different command and control servers, one in Malaysia and one in Denmark, but could have been updated throughout the operation to communicate with different command and control servers.²¹⁸ If Stuxnet had occurred during the course of an armed conflict, Malaysia and Denmark would have been in a difficult position. If Stuxnet was developed as a way to achieve effects comparable to attacking Natanz with conventional weapons,²¹⁹ it essentially substituted for conventional weapons. When military planners can use certain cyber capabilities and conventional weapons interchangeably, it defies logic to apply the neutrality rules to one and not the other.\n\nWith respect to Hague V, the analysis remains the same for the command and controls servers in the Stuxnet context as it does in the DoS attack context. The command and control servers in this scenario would be acting as virtual “wireless telegraphy stations” for the purpose of “communicating with belligerent forces” in violation of Article 3.²²⁰ The Stuxnet command and control servers compiled data received from each infected computer²²¹ and presumably sent that data to Stuxnet’s creators. Additionally, Stuxnet’s creators likely used the command and control servers to push updated versions of the code out to infected computers.²²² In an armed conflict scenario, it would be difficult to argue that these command and control servers are not communicating with belligerent forces. Furthermore, if malware has the ability to shut down a power grid or cripple an oil refinery, a belligerent may be more likely to respond militarily once it discovers the threat. Such a response might include damaging or disabling any known command and control servers or other\n\n²¹⁷ SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CENTER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE SECURITY POSTURE OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (Version 1.1, Aug. 20, 2010), available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/ics/ics_fact_sheet.pdf.\n²¹⁸ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²¹⁹ SANGER, supra note 201, at 188-191.\n²²⁰ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 3.\n²²¹ Stuxnet Dossier, supra note 195, at 21.\n²²² Zetter, supra note 191.\n\nCyber Neutrality 103",
    "vital network elements residing in that neutral state. As the likelihood of a military response against a neutral state’s network components increases, so does the need to apply the law of neutrality in order to prevent the spread of conflict.\n\nThe other aspect of Stuxnet that raises potential neutrality issues concerns the specific delivery path or paths the malicious code travels. Does the law of neutrality prohibit malicious packets of information from traveling over the network infrastructure of a neutral state on the way to a belligerent target? Applying the law of neutrality to this particular scenario is problematic for two reasons. First, individual packets might not all take the same route and users may not be able to control the route.²²³ Second, applicable neutrality rules are not likely needed in this situation to prevent the spread of conflict. Put another way, the fact that some packets travel over a neutral’s network on the way to a belligerent is not likely to trigger any military action against the neutral’s network. The Internet’s redundant design means that any military action to shut down one particular route would not have much, or any, practical effect; the packets will just take a different route.²²⁴ While not a perfect fit, this narrow situation should still fall under the scope of Hague V’s telegraph exception.²²⁵ The telegraph exception was largely based on practical limitations²²⁶ that are especially applicable to controlling or monitoring the delivery routes of individual packets. Furthermore, using the roads analogy discussed earlier, it is more appropriate to view the telecommunications service provider as transporting the code in this scenario since it is the service provider who is directing the path, not the belligerent.\n\nWhile it may not be appropriate to apply the neutrality rules to the delivery routes of individual packets in most cases, it is important to distinguish the situation where a belligerent uses a proxy in a neutral state. While belligerents may not be able to control the specific routes packets take, a belligerent ensures the packets go through a neutral state by using a proxy in that neutral state. A belligerent may use a proxy in a neutral state in order to make it appear as if the neutral state is supporting its effort or simply because the enemy may not scrutinize Internet traffic emanating from that neutral country in the same way it scrutinizes other Internet traffic. Either way, the deliberate use of proxy in a neutral state is likely an attempt to derive some form of military advantage from a neutral’s territorial infrastructure and is prohibited.²²⁷ This essentially collapses the neutrality analysis for the delivery of packets into an intent-based analysis, an approach often advocated.²²⁸ Addition-\n\n²²³ See Boebert, supra note 120, at 41-42.\n²²⁴ See id. at 42.\n²²⁵ Hague V, supra note 10, art. 8.\n²²⁶ See Hague Reports, supra note 14, at 543.\n²²⁷ See Hague V, supra note 10, art. 1 (“The territory of neutral States is inviolable.”).\n²²⁸ See, e.g., Davis Brown, A Proposal for an International Convention to Regulate the Use of Information Systems in Armed Conflict, 47 HARV.

    "ally, while there may not be much practical value in taking military action against a neutral’s network that is only carrying packets, “bricking”²²⁹ a proxy may be an effective countermeasure. Neutral states should not become cyber battle grounds for belligerents, where the burden of collateral damage would rest entirely on the neutral state.\n\nAs in the Georgia example, attribution limitations will not bar military action. Attribution limitations are certainly relevant, especially in conducting a proportionality analysis, but the fact remains that objects which are being used to “make an effective contribution to military action” are military objects and may be attacked.²³⁰ Every proxy computer in the chain would likely meet this definition and would therefore be subject to attack. For that matter, the cables that merely carry packets could also qualify as military, or dual-use, objects but the negligible military advantage to be gained by attacking them might be difficult to justify under a proportionality analysis.²³¹ As with the DoS attack scenario, it is technical attribution to a particular node/computer that triggers a belligerent’s ability to take military action against that particular node/computer, regardless of whether the belligerent can further attribute the conduct to a person, organization, or government.²³²\n\n## V. CONCLUSION\n\nThe neutrality rules are over a hundred years old and did not envision modern cyber capabilities but technological innovation in weaponry is nothing new. When cyber capabilities can viably substitute for conventional capabilities, whether they are damage-causing or damage-enabling capabilities, the neutrality rules must equally apply in order to preserve state sovereignty. Without applicable neutrality rules, belligerents will derive strategic advantages by purposely exploiting components of a neutral state’s infrastructure. Allowing the cyber component of the battlefield to expand to neutral states erodes a neutral state’s ability to stay out of a conflict. Belligerents do not seek symmetric responses. They constantly seek opportunities to overwhelm the enemy in the place and manner where they perceive an advantage. There is no guarantee that the cyber component of the battlefield could spread to neutral states without the conventional battlefield expanding there as well.\n\nAttribution remains a challenge, especially when it comes to punishing belligerents who might choose to violate a neutral state’s rights. Not only is technical attribution difficult but holding a state responsible also requires human attribution.\n\nNeutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1427, 1448-49 (2008).\n\n²²⁹ The term “bricking” refers to software or firmware changes that completely, and often permanently, disable a computer. See John Haubenreich, The iPhone and the DMCA: Locking the Hands of Customers, 61 VAND. L. REV. 1507, 1538, n.201 (2008).\n\n²³⁰ Additional Protocol I, supra note 178, art. 52.\n\n²³¹ Id. at art. 51.\n\n²³² See supra notes 178-179 and accompanying text.\n\nCyber Neutrality 105",
    "These attribution challenges may limit the deterrent value of applying the neutrality rules to cyber operations. However, as evidenced by the Mandiant report, large, prolonged cyber operations may be difficult to conceal indefinitely. Additionally, belligerents with sophisticated cyber capabilities may also rigorously monitor and control their own networks, strengthening attribution arguments based on Corfu Channel’s rationale. Finally, while attribution certainly poses a problem in holding belligerents responsible for neutrality violations, it is less important when the neutrality rules are used to impose a duty on neutral states. Neutral states may not have the incentive to dedicate the resources necessary to monitor their own networks, but belligerents do. When a belligerent traces malicious cyber activity to components of a neutral state’s infrastructure, it should be able to require the neutral state to take appropriate action if that state wants to remain neutral.\n\nAs with most areas of the law, technological advances create challenges. Sometimes the law is amended to explicitly deal with new technologies and sometimes the old law is interpreted to cover (or not cover) new technologies. When it comes to cyber capabilities and the law of neutrality, gaining international consensus to amend the law may not be possible and interpreting the law to not cover cyber operations threatens the entire institution of neutrality. By interpreting the neutrality rules with a focus on their purpose, states can usher respect for neutrality into twenty-first century warfare and continue to decide for themselves if and when to enter a conflict.\n\n106 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 71"
