Introduction\nIn this day and age, the Internet¹ is one of the most important means of communication and information. During the last 30 years it has gradually become an essential aspect of the economy in a globalized world and plays an indispensable role in, amongst other things, the administrative and judicial systems of technologically developed countries. All in all, critical infrastructure systems in States with high levels of technology dependency are acutely reliant upon reliable and effective operations of Internet based communication systems. Thus, given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to the security, protection and defence of the integrity of computer networks, the vulnerability of these communication systems has become a significant matter of national security to many such States. Accordingly, the current National Security Strategies of the USA², of the United Kingdom³,\n¹ The Internet is globally administered by a Californian (US) non-profit, public-benefit corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which, in the framework of a Public Private Partnership, is associated with and reports to the US Department of Commerce (although, according to the information on ICANN’s website, the organisation heavily emphasises its international nature and independence). ICANN bears global responsibility for ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet as well as for coordinating the Internet system of unique identifiers, i.e. for the assignment of IP-address ranges (since 2005 not directly to users but to regional organisations – see infra note 58). It is further responsible for the generic codes and country codes of the Internet top level domain as well as for the management and maintenance of the (secret) Internet root server system (see infra note 122). ICANN is the successor organization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which was executing the above-mentioned tasks directly on behalf of the US Department of Commerce (information available at http://www.icann/org/en/factsheets/factsheet.html; unless indicated otherwise, all URLs cited in the present survey were last visited on 31 November 2010). Originally, it was planned to transform ICANN into an independent organization in October 2006. During the 2nd World Summit on the Information Society, organized by the UN in Tunis in November 2005, it was proposed to submit ICANN (and thus the Internet itself) to management by the UN. The USA rejected this proposal and declared its intent to keep the control over ICANN for the time being (information available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/).\n² The President of the United States of America, National Security Strategy (May 2010), p. 27 et seq., available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf.\n³ Her Majesty’s Government, A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The National Security Strategy (October 2010), pp. 11 and 27, available at http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191639.pdf?CID=PDF&amp;PLA=furl&amp;CRE=nationalsecuritystrategy.\n49\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nand Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defence White Paper,⁴ all seek to address the issue of cyber-attacks. According to NATO’s new Strategic Concept of 19 November 2010, cyber threats are one of the major perils for the security of the Alliance in the future decade.⁵ Similar concerns are reflected in resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly over the last ten years, which regularly mention the integrity of information and communication technology in the context of international security and call for the creation of a global “culture of cyber security”.⁶ Additionally, the emerging threat of the use of\n⁴ Federal Ministry of Defence, White Paper 2006 on German Security Policy and the Future of the Bundeswehr (2006), p. 17: “Germany’s political and economic structures as well as its critical infrastructure have become more vulnerable as a result, not least where criminal activities, terrorist acts, or military attacks from or on cyberspace are concerned”; available at http://www.bmvg.de/fileserving/PortalFiles/C1256EF40036B05B/W26UWAMT995INFODE/W%202006%20eng%20DS.pdf.\n⁵ NATO, Strategic Concept For the Defence and Security of The Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Adopted by Heads of State and Government in Lisbon (19 November 2010), §§ 12 and 19, available at http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf. See also NATO, Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon, Lisbon Summit Declaration (20 November 2010), § 40: “Cyber threats are rapidly increasing and evolving in sophistication. In order to ensure NATO’s permanent and unfettered access to cyberspace and integrity of its critical systems, we will take into account the cyber dimension of modern conflicts in NATO’s doctrine and improve its capabilities to detect, assess, prevent, defend and recover in case of a cyber attack against systems of critical importance to the Alliance. We will strive in particular to accelerate NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) to Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2012 and the bringing of all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection. We will use NATO’s defence planning processes in order to promote the development of Allies’ cyber defence capabilities, to assist individual Allies upon request, and to optimize information sharing, collaboration and interoperability. To address the security risks emanating from cyberspace, we will work closely with other actors, such as the UN and the EU, as agreed. We have tasked the Council to develop, drawing notably on existing international structures and on the basis of a review of our current policy, a NATO in-depth cyber defence policy by June 2011 and to prepare an action plan for its implementation”; available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_68828.htm.\n⁶ See the resolutions Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, UN Documents A/53/70 of 4 December 1998, A/54/49 of 1 December 1999, A/55/28 of 20 November 2000, A/56/19 of 29 November 2001, A/57/53 of 22 November 2002, A/58/32 of 8 December 2003, A/59/61 of 3 December 2004, A/60/45 of 8 December 2005, A/61/55 of 6 December 2006, and A/62/17 of 5 December 2007. With regard to the creation of a global culture of cyber security, see the resolutions Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information structures,\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nthe Internet for terrorist purposes (cyber terrorism) is currently on the agendas of several international initiatives and programmes.7\nMilitary forces use the Internet for communication purposes and – to a certain extent – as an inherent component of particular weapon systems. Additionally, the Internet offers the possibility for offensive and/or defensive military actions by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. The military term “Computer Network Operations” (CNO) refers, generally speaking, to computer hacking and back-hacking in the context of a military operation.\nWorldwide, military forces are preparing for the fight in cyberspace. It has been alleged that Israeli armed forces have engaged in CNO activities since the early 1990s.8 The USA established a US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in Fort Meade, Maryland on 23 June 2009 (operational as of October 2010) which unified the already existing cyber capabilities of the US National Security Agency and several US military services (Army Forces Cyber Command, 24th US Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command).9 According to media reports, Belgium10, Germany11, South Korea12 (allegedly in reaction to respective North Korean endeavours), and the\nUN Documents A/55/63 of 4 December 2000, A/56/121 of 19 December 2001, A/57/239 of 20 December 2002, and A/58/199 of 23 December 2003.\n7 This includes: United Nations, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and Organization of American States (OAS).

Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n¹³ See C.

Branigen, ‘Chinese Army to Target Cyber War Threat’, Guardian online of 22 July 2010, available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/22/chinese-army-cyber-war-department.\n¹⁵ According to some reports, Chinese armed forces built up CNO capabilities already some years ago, see e.g. Northrop Grumman Corporation - Information Systems Sector, Capability of the People’s Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation (Report of 9 October 2009 Prepared for The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), available at http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## II. The Nature and Significance of CNO\nIn the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).\n## 1. Forms and Effects of CNO\nThe concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA).\nThe above-mentioned components of CNO are strongly interrelated. An adversary’s CNA can help one’s own CND when analysed appropriately. A CNE cannot be conducted without CNA, as the information to be gathered by CNE will mostly be protected by firewalls, passwords and other barriers that are erected to prevent an adversarial CNA. Finally, CNA cannot be conducted without CNE, as without information gathering on the targeted network’s architecture and systems the CNA would effectively be conducted blindly.\nWhile the practical value of the taxonomy of CND/CNE/CNA therefore is questionable, it will be presented in more detail below as most academic writings and media reports refer to this classification.\n## A. CND\nCND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\none’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone).¹⁶ The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies,¹⁷ merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA.\n## B. CNE\nAccording to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”.¹⁸ This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage.\nAccording to open source reports, the vast majority of CNO activities conducted during peacetime consist of CNE. For example, already in 2007, the British intelligence service MI5 warned all financial service providers and companies in Great Britain against concerted cyber espionage endeavours by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.¹⁹ In summer 2007, the computer systems of Germany’s Federal Chancellery as well as those of some federal ministries were infected with spyware (i.e. espionage software) reported to have originated from China.²⁰ According to the Annual Report 2009 of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, computer systems of Germany’s federal and state governments and of private businesses were targeted by hundreds of (successful and/or unsuccessful) CNE. Foreign intelligence\n16 For more information on CND see: NATO, ‘Defending against Cyber Attacks’, available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49193.htm.\n17 See e.g. US Navy Marine Corps Intranet, ‘Active Computer Network Defense Strategy: Cyber-Centric Maneuver Warfare’, available at http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/PEOEIS/NMCI/Documents/Attachment%2011%20-%20Active%20Computer%20Network%20Defense%20Strategy_nmcia11.pdf.\n18 NATO Standardization Agency (NSA), *NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions* (2010), Doc.

Blau, ‘German Gov’t PCs Hacked, China Offers to Investigate’, *The Washington Post online* of 27 August 2007, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/27/AR2007082700595.html.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nservices were likely to be the organizers of, or are involved in, most of these.²¹ In the USA, over 100 foreign intelligence services currently endeavour to intrude computer systems located in the country, as the US Deputy Secretary of Defence stated in September 2010.²² NATO’s computer networks are also subject to constant – and partly successful – CNE.²³\nThere is no open source information as to the employment of CNE during an armed conflict. However, it can be assumed that CNE is very likely to be used in support of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance.\n## C. CNA\nCNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”.²⁴ These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware²⁵). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks.\nRelatively harmless, data modification in the course of a CNA can modify and deface a website (defacement). This is often conducted by hackers who wish to express their political view (hacktivism). Another widely spread form of CNA is the Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack\n21 Bundesministerium des Innern, Verfassungsschutzbericht 2009 (2010), p. 308, available at http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/de/publikationen/verfassungsschutzbericht/vsbericht_2009/vsbericht_2009.pdf; summary (in English), pp. 9 et seq., available at http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/SHOW/vsbericht_2009_engl.pdf.\n22 W.J. Lynn, ‘Defending a New Domain: The Pentagons Cyberstrategy’, Vol. 89 Foreign Affairs 2010, p. 99, available at http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66552/william-j-lynn-iii/defending-a-new-domain.\n23 See NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Annual Session 2009, Committee Report 173 DSCFC 09 E bis – ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’, available at http://www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=1782.\n24 Id.\n25 Malware stands for malicious software, i.e. a damaging EDP program (e.g. exploits, bugs, worms, viruses, zombies).\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(DDoS-attack),²⁶ which can cause delays in the data transfer process, the denial of access to computer systems or servers (e.g. the targeted websites or a email service) or result in the (only temporary) disabling of the targeted systems. The particular DDoS-techniques are as diverse as the – partly very effective – countermeasures²⁷ developed since 2000.\nHowever, the deletion or modification of data in a successfully intruded computer network can be more hazardous. Hackers can generate wrong information, for instance in the military environment the content of electronically transmitted orders, plans and maps or the localization data of military targets contained in a targeting-database.\nMoreover, it is possible that a CNA could – indirectly – cause death, physical injury or physical destruction of property. As far as chemical plants, nuclear power stations, oil refinery installations, gas store installations or electrical power distribution installations have or rely on computer-based control systems, these systems could be penetrated and manipulated. Thus, a CNA could cause the explosion of a nuclear power plant if the cooling systems were disabled via remote control. The same applies to computer-based control systems of transportation systems. By manipulation of the rail points, train derailments or collisions could be caused; penetration and minimal amendments to the programming of an air traffic control system could result in aircraft incidents. Therefore, the classification of CNO as a non-lethal weapon, as asserted by some scholars,²⁸ has to be challenged in this regard. Also, the general assertion made that CNO, in its current form would generally not violate LOAC, is questionable.²⁹\n26 A Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS attack) is a Denial of Service attack (DoS attack) simultaneously conducted from several computers, which are interconnected by a previously (and mostly in secret) established computer network (net boot). During a DoS attack, the targeted server is overloaded by a mass of connectivity requests, which first results in a significant delay of data processing. This subsequently leads to a denial of data processing service and finally results in the disabling of the affected server. This effect can be caused by sending either masses of data packages (e.g. emails to an email server) or masses of connectivity requests (e.g. masses of connectivity requests to a website).\n27 See C. Patrikakis, M. Masikos, &amp; O. Zouraraki, ‘Distributed Denial of Service Attacks’, Vol. 7 No. 4 The Internet Protocol Journal 2004, available at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_7-4/dos_attacks.html.\n28 Contra: M.N. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attacks: The Normative Software’, Vol. 4 Y.I.H.L. 2001, p. 75; and H.-J. Heintze, ‘Nichtletale Waffen und das humanitäre Völkerrecht’, Vol. 18 Sicherheit und Frieden 2000, p. 2.\n29 Though such an assertion is made by R. Hoffmann, ‘Information War. Tendenzen – Optionen – Perspektiven’, Vol. 15 Humanitäres Völkerrecht –\n56\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nAbove all, CNA can affect the functioning of a State, when manipulating or deleting data in computer systems of critical infrastructure systems. The list of critical infrastructure systems will slightly differ from State to State. By way of example, the following areas identified by the German Federal Office of Security of Information Technology (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) can be considered as critical infrastructure systems:³⁰ transportation and traffic (postal services, local traffic, roads, rail system, aviation, sea and inland navigation); energy (nuclear plants, distribution and transfer systems of electricity, oil, gas); hazardous substances (chemical and biological agents, nuclear reactors); information and telecommunication technology; finance, currency and insurance (banks, insurance companies, financial service providers, stock markets); public utilities (health, emergency and rescue sector, disaster control, food and water supply, waste management); government, administration, justice, police, customs and armed forces.\nMany of these critical infrastructure systems are based on computer-based control systems, such as the generation and distribution of electricity or telecommunications. Some function entirely on the basis of an Internet connection, including the banking and stock exchange systems. Other areas are increasingly reliant on the Internet, for example the so-called e-justice and e-government. In any technologically highly developed, post-industrial State most of the critical infrastructure systems can be deemed to depend on the operability and efficiency of electronic data transfer. The devastating effects and the subsequent disruption of the ordre public caused by a CNA are limited only by the imagination of the reader. Therefore, cyber security plays a paramount role for the national security of many States and was noted as one of the major perils for the Alliance's security in NATO's Strategic Concept of 2010 (see supra I).\nThere is open source information available in the media on CNA being conducted during peacetime.\nThe only publicly known case, in which the attribution of a CNA to a particular State can be asserted, was the penetration and temporary disabling of Syrian air defence networks, especially the radar systems, by Israel on 6 September 2007, immediately followed by an airstrike by Israel's Air Force destroying Syria's Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Deir-Az-Zur.³¹\n³⁰ See the list of critical infrastructure systems, available at https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/Publikationen/Faltblaetter/F17KritischeInfrastruktur.html.\n³¹ Ben-David, supra note 8.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nA more prominent case of a successful CNA against a State are the DDoS-attacks launched against several critical infrastructure systems in Estonia during the 27 April – 18 May 2007 timeframe. The “attacks”³² targeted websites and communication channels of the government and commercial services.³³ For example, the web-services of the major banks Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank were (at one-time) interrupted for 1,5 hours;³⁴ the website of a governing coalition party was defaced;³⁵ emergency phone numbers were disengaged for a short time;³⁶ and three major Estonian Internet Service Providers and some online news providers were disconnected (although it is unclear for how long).³⁷ The estimated physical (because of the disengagement of emergency phone numbers) and economic damage caused by the DDoS-attacks remains unclear. The attacks most probably originated from the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the relatively simple DDoS-methods and the political context of the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, it is asserted that the “attackers” were politically motivated private persons (hacktivism).³⁸\nAnother example of successful CNA during peacetime are the defacement and DDoS-attacks launched against Lithuania between 28 June and 1 July 2008. The CNA may have been connected either to the amendment of Lithuania’s laws to prohibit the display of symbols of the Soviet Union or the singing of its anthem in public³⁹ or to the unilateral veto⁴⁰ against discussions on an EU energy partnership deal with Russian Federation. Over 300 Lithuanian websites were defaced, including those of the Government.⁴¹ Given the pro-Russian contents\n32 The term “attack” does not indicate the legal assessment of the incidents as an “armed attack” in the meaning of Art. 51 UN Charter or Art. 5 North Atlantic Treaty.\n33 E.

It can be assumed that also in the near future CNO are very likely to be used merely in support of a conventional military operation, mainly military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, or in order to influence the perception of a particular political conflict in the online media.\n## 2. Identification of the Origin and Attribution of Malicious CNO\nIt will always be difficult to unequivocally identify the computer systems that malicious CNO originated from and to attribute the attack to a certain entity, group or a State.\nA cyber attack is distinguished by its rapidness.

Markoff, ‘Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks’, The New York Times online of 13 August 2008, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=2&amp;em.\n⁵⁶ For more details, see id.\n⁵⁷ Id.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nthus the identification of the originating computer system are highly improbable. It is highly unlikely that hackers will leave any tangible evidence, for example in the protocols of the intrusion detection systems of the attacked network, as such evidence in these protocols is easy to delete once the network is penetrated.\nMoreover, and further aggravating the issue, a cyber-attack can be conducted “anonymously”, for example by using one of the (often) free of charge anonymisation services offered on the Internet which would hide the unique characteristics of the hackers’ computer system. These unique characteristics are the so-called IP address⁵⁸ as well as other technical data⁵⁹ a computer sends while connected to the Internet.\n⁵⁸ An IP address (Internet Protocol number) is a twelve digit number, which identifies a computer or another network device during an Internet session. An IP data package is the basic element of data transmission via the Internet. It comprises: a header (containing information on the source, destination, status and fragmentation of the transmitted data) and a payload (containing the transmitted data). At the very beginning of the Internet, the IANA (see supra note 1) assigned static IP addresses, i.e. IP addresses permanently assigned to a particular user, to companies, organizations, universities and also to individuals. The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only. After the particular Internet session the dynamic IP address is assigned to another user and client of the respective Access Provider. At present, the so-called static IP-addresses are only being used for leased Internet-lines of major corporations and other entities.\n⁵⁹ These include: Media Access Control address (MAC address) or – for the operating system Apple – the Airport ID of a computer (order of numbers, which clearly identifies a computer hardware); Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, details on the assignment of a MAC address or Airport ID to an IP address); Service Set Identity (SSID, details on the network name); Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol (WEP, coded details about the network); as well as details on the operating system and its adjustments. These details are – if not blocked – automatically transferred during the Internet session to any computer requesting this information by a so-called PING (Packet InterNet Grouper). A PING is computer software sending an ICMP-Echo-Request data package to the destination address of the host which is to be scanned, i.e. to the IP address, to the Domain Name System name (DNS name) or to the Network Basic Input Output System name (NetBIOS name) of the targeted host. The targeted system automatically responds by an ICMP-Echo-Reply, if – according to the usual adjustments of the system – the system supports the ICMP package.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nFurthermore, the Internet offers possibilities for deception in regard to the identity of the hackers' computer systems. It is perfectly possible to feign someone else's IP address and other technical data (so-called malicious misrepresentation or spoofing) and thus to operate in the Internet under someone else's \"cyber-identity\". The connection to the Internet can also be established via a mobile phone or other device with a feigned identity number. Additionally, the data stream can be conducted through the whole globe via a chain of computers of numerous unsuspecting individuals, if so-called zombie software (partly offered free of charge on the Internet) has been secretly installed on the respective computers by using Trojans. One of these computers could subsequently be misused as the sender of the data stream (so-called remote control). Thus, in the case of a cyber attack, even after a back tracing of the malicious data stream, the victim can seldom be sure as of the identification and geographical location of the computer system the attack originated from.\nAbove all, even if a malicious data stream of a cyber attack would indeed be successfully back-traced to the hackers' computer systems, it will – highly probable – remain unproven which individuals of which citizenship and on who's orders were operating the systems identified. Therefore, the attribution of a cyber attack to a certain individual, group, entity or State will most probably be based on unproven suspicions or indications only.\nConsequently, it will be very unlikely to recognize at first sight – and probably even after detailed technical analysis – whether the attack was conducted by a mischievous teenager, by a criminal (including a terrorist), by a group with extremist or terrorist background or by the adversary Party in an armed conflict.\nThese uncertainties will surely add to the complexity of both the legal analysis of a cyber attack and the victim's decision on choosing a subsequent course of action. Considering the difficulty in identifying and locating the hackers' computer systems and – most importantly – attributing the attack, in most cases it will remain in doubt whether national police forces and public prosecutors or, in the framework of international judicial cooperation, the police forces and public prosecutors of a foreign State, or the armed forces (in the case the attack occurs during an already existing armed conflict and is believed to have originated with a party to the armed conflict, or in the case the effects of the cyber-attack are comparable to a conventional armed\n63\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nattack and trigger the right to self-defence) retain main responsibility to deal with the case.\n## 3. CNO in Modern Warfare\nThe significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations is manifold.\nWhilst most armed conflicts in this day and age are occurring in regions that are technologically less sophisticated (e.g. Afghanistan, Sudan or Chad), this does not result in the irrelevance of the Internet and of CNO. It must be taken into consideration that, in regard to communication abilities and collection of open source information, the parties to armed conflicts in less well developed regions are also essentially dependent on – aside from radio traffic – wireless Internet connectivity, as other communication and information systems (e.g. telecommunication media, print media, telephone lines) are often non-existent.\nIt is especially evident in the context of so-called asymmetric warfare and in the hands of non-state actors, for instance terrorists, that CNO can be a powerful weapon, primarily against post-industrial States and their potent armed forces. More than ever, post-industrial States have technologically highly developed armed forces at their disposal, which correspondingly react most sensitively to technical disorder. It is the dependence on the technology which makes them extremely vulnerable to a cyber attack.\nAs CNO can be conducted from any place in the world by as little as a few experts and, in addition, are extraordinarily inexpensive when compared with conventional military operations, they offer a particularly practical and extremely powerful \"weapon\". Therefore, all aspects of CNO (see supra II.1) show an increasing significance in the context of national as well as of international security.\nAs the Head of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Co-ordination Centre stated already in 2008: \"Cyber war can become a very effective global problem because it is low-risk, low-cost, highly effective and easily globally deployable. It is almost an ideal weapon that nobody can ignore\".60\n60 N. Heath, ‘NATO: Cyber Terrorism “as Dangerous as Missile Attack”’, silicon.com of 7 March 2008, available at http://www.silicon.com/technology/security/2008/03/07/nato-cyber-terrorism-as-dangerous-as-missile-attack-39170300/.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## III. Legal Analysis of CNO\nAlthough some scholars plead for a general prohibition of CNO, currently such a ban does not exist.⁶¹ However, many international and domestic legal restrictions do apply to CNO – a fact which makes a legal analysis a complex undertaking.\nApart from the fundamental principle of public international law, namely the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations, a number of specific areas of public international law may apply to CNO. As data packages pass through the territory of several States when sent via the Internet, the provisions of territorial sovereignty must be considered. Also, data manipulations might – under certain circumstances – be judged as intervention in domestic affairs of a State, which would be considered illegal under public international law. Further, because satellite technology is involved, space law and especially treaties relating to satellites must be considered. As CNO can interfere with telecommunication systems and always result in data amendments in the working storage of the attacked computer system, both international telecommunications law and international copyright law (in regard to software) require a thorough analysis. In case human rights treaty law is generally applicable, their respective provisions must be considered, especially in regard to secrecy of correspondence, telecommunications and data protection, as well as to the right to receive and impart information and ideas. Restraints for CNO can further result from the provisions of diplomatic and consular law, whenever diplomatic or consular computer systems are involved. Furthermore, it has been asserted that international environmental law principles of good neighbourhood and of the prevention of significant trans-boundary harm would be applicable to CNO in analogy.⁶² In addition, the provisions of\n⁶¹ A. D’Amato pleads for a general prohibition of CNO, emphasizing that the stability of the international community depends on the free flow of information (p. 68) and that every nation has a vital interest in the operationability of the Internet (p. 69), see A. D’Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’, in M.N. Schmitt &amp; B.T. O’Donnell (eds.), *Computer Network Attack and International Law* (Newport / Rhode Island, US Naval War College, 2002), pp. 59–71, pp. 67–69. See also: T. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position. Viewing Information Warfare as Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’, Vol. 30 *Case Western Reserve* J.I.L. 1998, p. 600.\n⁶² Such assertion is made – emphasizing that the Internet is a global resource comparable to the natural environment – by T. Stein &amp; T. Marauhn, ‘Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen’, Vol. 60 *Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht* 2000, p. 21. A similar approach\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nrespective national law systems, especially constitutional and criminal law, must always be taken into consideration.\nGiven the variety of areas of law involved and the limited scope of this survey, the following remarks will be restricted to the analysis of LOAC, focusing on the provisions of the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Annex to the Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (HR), the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GC) $^{63}$ and their Additional Protocols I $^{64}$ (AP I) and II $^{65}$ (AP II) (2). However, first of all, it must be examined under which conditions LOAC applies to CNO (1).\n## 1. The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict\nAccording to common Article 2 of the GCs, LOAC applies to\nall cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.\nIn practice, armed conflicts surely can be considered as the main case of application of LOAC. Pursuant to the prevailing opinion an\nis taken by the (non-binding) OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems of 1992, which call for cooperation of States (Principle 6) in the area of comprehensive protection of information systems (Principle 4), and which stipulate an imperative of deliberation in the use of information systems (Principle 3), see OECD Doc. OCDE/GD(92)190. However, an analogous application of international environmental law provisions is not convincing because of the lack of an “unintended omission” or of the absence of regulation. International telecommunication law, in particular the provisions of the (almost universally ratified) Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) of 22 December 1992, binds ITU Member States to far-reaching obligations in regard to the protection of communication and information systems (see in particular Articles 6, 33, 38, 45 and 47 of the ITU Constitution).\n$^{63}$ These are: Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949; Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949; Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\n$^{64}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\n$^{65}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\ninternational armed conflict occurs when one or more States have recourse to “armed force” against another State, regardless of the legality, reasons or the intensity of this confrontation.⁶⁶ This opinion is confirmed by the Commentary on the GC which states that “any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2”.⁶⁷ Art. 1(4) AP I extends the definition of international armed conflict to include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination.⁶⁸ A non-international armed conflict within the meaning of the common Article 3 GCs occurs when one or more non-governmental organized armed groups are involved and the situation reaches a certain threshold of confrontation, distinguishing it from internal disturbances, riots or acts of banditry (see also Art. 1 AP II).⁶⁹ Thus, a situation of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and consequently the application of LOAC is given, when States or – under certain circumstances – organized armed groups use “armed force” against the other Party.\nUnsurprisingly, LOAC is applicable to all CNO conducted either in support of conventional military operations carried out in the event of an already ongoing armed conflict or conducted as the first step preparing the immediate start of conventional military operations altogether comprising an armed conflict.\nWhether “cyber war”, i.e. military operations conducted exclusively by the means of the Internet or other computer networks without the employment of other weaponry (in the following referred to as: “isolated” CNO), will ever per se be classified as “use of armed force” and thus comprise an armed conflict, depends on future State practice. As there is an absence of detailed academic work⁷⁰ on this particular\n⁶⁶ See D. Fleck (ed.), *The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law* (Oxford / New York, Oxford University Press, 2008, 2nd ed.), §§ 202 and 210; see also a compendium of scholar opinions in: International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), *How is the Term “Armed Conflict” Defined in International Humanitarian Law?*, Opinion Paper (March 2008), p. 1 et seq., available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf.\n⁶⁷ J.

J.P. Terry describes cyberwar as a “lesser form of international conflict”, see J.P. Terry, ‘Responding to Attacks on Critical Computer Infrastructure. What\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nquestion, the following remarks will show criteria useful for the assessment whether particular types of “isolated” CNO constitute an armed conflict (A.). Furthermore, it will be analysed how the ius in bello terms “attack”, “act of violence” and “hostilities” apply to CNO (B.).\n## A. “Isolated” CNO as Armed Conflict\nAs stated above, an (international or non-international) armed conflict occurs when States or – under certain circumstances – (a State and/or) organized armed group(s) use “armed force” against each other.\nOf course, the notion of “use of armed force” – indicating that differences and confrontations did indeed reach the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and thus trigger the applicability of the ius in bello – is to be distinguished from the term “use of (armed)” force pursuant to Article 2(4) UN Charter, although the two terms are closely related. Whenever a State conducts actions considered as a “use of armed force” in the meaning of ius ad bellum against another State, this indicates the outbreak of hostilities reaching the level of “use of force” in the meaning of ius in bello and thus the threshold of an armed conflict triggering the applicability of LOAC – with the possible exception of quick, discrete and “surgical” use of force in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter without further retort by the victim (as e.g. the bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osirak/Iraq by Israeli Air Force in 1981).\nIn the following, criteria for the assessment whether a particular type of “isolated” CNO constitutes an armed conflict will be developed. The question whether a certain type of CNO can be deemed as “use of armed\nTargets? What Rules of Engagement?”, in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 434; see also the remarks by L. Doswald-Beck, 'Some Thoughts on Computer Network Attack and the International Law of Armed Conflict', in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 165.\n71 Illustrating the different lines of argument in regard to further specification of the term “force”, as used by the UN Charter, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. Therefore, without further explanation in the following it will be assumed that “force” under the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is to be understood as “armed force” as well as forcible measures of physical nature short of an armed attack, which can be defeated by the use of armed force only (e.g. deliberate spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing a widespread cross-boundary flood); see especially in regard to the distinction between the term “force” on the one hand and the terms “economic” or “political coercion” on the other hand, representatively: A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations. A Commentary (Oxford / New York, Oxford University Press, 2002, 2nd ed.), § 21.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nforce” (in the *ius in bello* meaning) will be examined (while – apart from the above stated exception – exactly the same criteria can indicate whether “use of force” in the meaning of the *ius ad bellum* is given). However, most academic writings on CNO do refer to “use of armed force” in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter. References to such writings will be made when useful and appropriate in the discussion of the term “use of armed force” in the *ius in bello* meaning.\nAccording to the traditional understanding, the assumption is that the “use of armed force” requires the employment of kinetic weaponry; that is the employment of a tool designed to cause kinetic effects of physical nature on a body or on an object. CNO are usually neither designed nor intended to directly cause kinetic effects. The transfer of data and its delay or interruption, as well as the manipulation, suppression or deletion of data cannot be deemed to cause kinetic effects in the common meaning of the term. Therefore, a significant qualitative difference between CNO and conventional weapons can be identified. In contrast, some similarities between CNO and biological or chemical weapons (hereinafter referred to as BC weapons) can be conceived. The use of BC weapons does not cause destruction in conventional sense, because these weapons do not set free any kinetic energy.72 The employment of BC weapons is considered as a form of “use of armed force” because, although not resulting in physical destruction of material, these weapons are employed in order to cause death or injury to living things.73 Thus, in the case of BC weapons, the term “weapon” is defined with reference to their effects rather than their method, which perfectly corresponds with the effects-based approach inherent to public international law. Consequently, the majority of scholars rightly insist on an effects-based interpretation of the term of “use of armed force” in the context of CNO.74\nTherefore, in the following, different categories of potential effects which can be caused by CNO will be illustrated in order to determine when CNO must be deemed as “use of armed force”.\n72 J.

Death, Physical Injury and/or Destruction of Property\nAccording to the nearly uniform opinion among scholars (to which the author of the present survey subscribes), a CNO – similarly to the effects caused by BC weapons – should be considered as “use of armed force” if it results in death, physical injury or the destruction of property.75 As illustrated above (II.1.C), CNO can indirectly76 cause such effects.\nAccording to a minority view amongst scholars, a CNO, even if it indirectly causes death, physical injury or the destruction of property, qualifies as “use of armed force” only if at the same time it amounts to a “use of structural force”.77 “Structural force” is described in the public international law literature as a physical incursion into a State’s\n75 Y.

Schmitt proposes a catalogue of criteria indicating that CNO constitute “use of force”:\n- severity of the effects, i.e. threat of physical injury or destruction of property,\n- immediacy of the occurrence of the negative consequences,\n- direct nexus between the CNO and the negative consequences caused,\n- invasiveness of the consequences on foreign territory,\n- measurability of the consequences,\n- pre-assumption of illegitimacy of the CNO according to national rules and to the International Public Law, based on the prima facie illegitimacy of the use of force in international relations (the author of the present survey only guesses that the term “illegitimacy” indeed stands for “illegality”).\nSee Schmitt, supra note 28, pp. 65 et seq. This approach is not convincing because of the circular reasoning it contains. It cannot be decided whether a particular act is indeed illegal, by the simultaneous assertion of the illegality of the same act.\n76 In the present context the term “indirectly” means that CNO cause immediate effects on the targeted computer systems which only in the consequence result in damages outside the directly affected networks.\n77 W.H. von Heinegg, ‘Informationskrieg und Völkerrecht.

According to the prevailing opinion among public international law scholars and the settled jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, an “armed attack” only occurs when the “use of armed force” reaches a certain level of intensity in regard to its effects and scale.80 When this threshold of intensity is not reached, the respective actions in question can still be considered as “use of armed force”, although they do not constitute an “armed attack”.81 Therefore, the above presented view asserting that CNO can only be deemed as “use of force” when it comprises “structural force”, and thus setting the terms of “use of armed force” and “armed attack” equal, is highly questionable.\nFurthermore, some scholars demand additional criteria to be met in order to classify CNO as “use of armed force”. This is the direct nexus between the CNO and physical damage, the immediacy of the occurrence of the physical damage (in the sense that the occurrence of the damage does not depend on any additional factors) as well as whether the damage can be foreseen at all.82 However, these criteria determine the conditions of attribution of the damage to a certain action, and are therefore not relevant for the specification of the term “use of armed force”.\n78 Randelzhofer, supra note 71, § 21; Sharp, supra note 75, p. 101; also see Judge Schwebel’s dissenting opinion in ICJ, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Destruction of Data\nSome academic writings assert that the destruction of data of substantial importance and/or of significant economical value should be considered as “use of armed force”.83 But, in consequence, it would need to have been ascertained in every particular case whether indeed data of some economic value has been destroyed or whether the CNO is to be considered as trivial because the compromised or deleted data is of little or no value. In addition, it must be considered that in the case of a so-called DoS attack84 data will not be destroyed but rather its use and information value will be diminished by delay of its transmission or by temporary denial of access to the data. Furthermore, the effect of CNO directed against data only is not comparable to the effects of conventional weapons, for example a bombardment, or of BC weapons. Therefore, the above presented view is not convincing, as it is of little practical value and could lead to unbearable results.\nOther scholars assert that at least the destruction of data symbolizing an asset (e.g. data of an electronically operated banking account) should be considered as “use of armed force”.85 They suggest that this assessment would reflect the obligation to protect civilian objects from dangers arising from military operations.86 However, electronic assets, accounts, demands or claims cannot be equated with objects or physical property and their destruction cannot be compared with the destructive effects on physical property caused by conventional (or BC) weapons. Therefore, the opinion presented above does not capture accurately the translation of the traditional understanding of the term “use of armed force” into the “cyberspace”.\nIf, however, a CNO was to be directed against the whole economic or banking system as one of the critical infrastructures of a State, the situation must be judged differently (see III.1.A.v. on critical infrastructure systems).\n## iii. “Theft” of Data\nMoreover, it is asserted that the “theft” of particular data should be considered as “use of armed force”, if information of vital interest to\n83 See Barkham, supra note 72, p. 88.\n84 See supra note 26.\n85 M.N.

Id.\n86 Id.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\na State, for instance classified information, is compromised.⁸⁷ Also the “theft” of all data of military nature (regardless of the classification) should be considered as “use of armed force”.⁸⁸ However, the “theft” of data (CNE) merely represents a kind of modern espionage which is not generally forbidden under public international law.⁸⁹ All in all, “theft” of data – even classified data of importance to the military – cannot be deemed as having similar effects as conventional or BC weapons and therefore cannot be judged as “use of armed force”. Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict.\niv. Massive Disruption of Military C3-Systems\nAdditionally, some scholars assert that the destruction⁹⁰ or medium to long-term disruption⁹¹ of military command, control and communication systems (C3-systems) is to be deemed as “use of armed force”. Indeed, the intended outcome, namely the disruption of military communications and the consequent restraining ability on military command and control, can be achieved both through the physical destruction of respective systems by conventional weapons and through the massive disruption of the systems by malicious CNO. As such, the effect of a corresponding CNO is quite comparable to the effects of the employment of conventional weapons. This view is supported by Article VI of the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities concluded between the USA and the Soviet Union on 12 June 1989.⁹² According to this provision, the disruption of command and control systems (C2), resulting even in a mere restraint of those systems, would be regarded as a dangerous military activity. Given the political context of the agreement the provision indicates that a – massive – disruption of\n⁸⁷ Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846, 855; contra: Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 10.\n⁸⁸ Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846 and 856.\n⁸⁹ D’Amato, supra note 61, p. 67; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 32 with further references. In regard to CNO as a modern form of espionage see: von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 134. Apart from the penalisation of espionage resulting from respective national law systems, spying is restrained by certain provisions of public international law, e.g. the taboos stated by the diplomatic and consular law protecting diplomatic and consular archives and correspondence, i.e. respective electronic databases and communication via the Internet.\n⁹⁰ See M. Bothe, ‘Völkerrechtliche Verhinderung von Gewalt (ius contra bellum)’, in W. Graf Vitzthum, Völkerrecht (Berlin, De Gruyter, 2001), Section 8, § 10.\n⁹¹ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8. See also Sharp, supra note 75, p. 129, who recognizes the right to self-defence against an attack on computer networks of “vital interest” to a State.\n⁹² Vol. 28 I.L.M. 1989, pp. 877 et seq.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nmilitary C3-systems could indeed be seen by States as “use of force”.\n## v. Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems\nThere is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems⁹³ by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]”⁹⁴ This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.\nHowever, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment.⁹⁵ This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems.⁹⁶ It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing\n⁹³ See supra section II.1.C.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n⁹⁵ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n⁹⁶ Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599.

Intermediate Result\nAll in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities”\nAs far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\n2. Restraints for Malicious CNO Resulting from LOAC Provisions\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of\n97 See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52 (1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n98 See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II.\n99 See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n100 Presently, 194 States are Parties to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (and thus two more States than Parties to the United Nations Charter, usually referred to as a universal treaty). The present status of ratifications to the Hague Conventions of 1907 and Geneva Conventions of 1949 as well as to their Additional Protocols of 1977 is available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO?OpenView.\n75\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nwhich is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).\n## A. Prohibited Methods and Means of Warfare\n### i. Perfidy\nArticle 23(f) HR in conjunction with Articles 38 and 39 AP I as well as Article 12 AP II prohibit the misuse of distinctive emblems, signs, signals or flags of protected entities¹⁰¹, including those of the Red Cross and its associated entities and of the United Nations. Furthermore, the provisions ban the misuse of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Party to the particular armed conflict as well as of the adversary Party (though, in regard to the latter only while engaging in attack or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations).¹⁰² Moreover, Article 44(3) AP I states the obligation for all members of the armed forces to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.\nAlthough the above-mentioned provisions refer to physically visible symbols carried by individuals or objects, the rules can also be observed in the \"cyberspace\". The spirit and purpose of these provisions is to preserve the neutrality of certain entities and to protect certain groups against dangers arising from military operations. Therefore, Parties to an armed conflict must not misuse the identity of these entities or groups. Consequently, the \"cyber identity\" (i.e. website, e-mail address, email header, IP address and other technical data sent while connected to the Internet) of one of the protected organisations or groups must not be used at any time during the conduct of CNO. A simple example of the ban would be that the header of an e-mail sent to adversary armed forces, containing a virus, indirectly causing physical damage outside the targeted network, must not show, for instance, the Red Cross as the\n¹⁰¹ Also see the Annex I to the AP I.\n¹⁰² Exceptions to those rules are stated in Article 39(3) AP I in regard to espionage and to the conduct of armed conflict at sea.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nsender. Also, while hacking adversary computer networks, the CNO forces must not feign technical data, which would lead to presumption of the “cyber identity” of a civilian if the concrete CNO conducted is to be considered as an “attack” or an “act preparatory to an attack” in the meaning of Article 44(3) AP I. Moreover, any respective manipulation of websites belonging to the protected entities would be illegal.\nIn addition, the prohibition of Article 23(b) HR in conjunction with Article 37(1) AP I, to kill, injure or capture an adversary under recourse to perfidy, applies to CNO. In general terms, perfidy describes an act which leads the adversary to erroneously believe that he or she is entitled to, or is obliged to accord protection under LOAC (see the definition of perfidy in Article 37(1) AP I). The ban covers, inter alia, intentional dissemination of misinformation to the adversary Party about the intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender, or about an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, as well as feigning civilian, non-combatant or protected status (e.g. of a United Nations employee or of a member of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, by using respective emblems, signs, signals or uniforms, see Art. 23(f) HR and Art. 37(1) AP I). The aforementioned misinformation can generally be transmitted by the means of the Internet, for example by e-mail or as a statement on a website. As already stated (e.g. supra II.2.), the “cyber-identity” of the aforementioned protected persons can easily be feigned in the “cyberspace”. However, the above described dissemination of misinformation or feigning of the (cyber) identity of a protected person is prohibited only if it directly¹⁰³ results in the death, injury or capture of the adversary.\nConversely, legal ruses of war in the sense of Article 24 HR and Article 37(2) AP I, which are merely aimed to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly, offer a broad field of application to CNO. Thus, it is imaginable that a Party to an armed conflict establishes a so-called honey net around its own computer network, i.e. an outside-network building a buffer around its own computer network, which is only minimally protected against hacking and, technically speaking,\n¹⁰³ The specific nexus between the dissemination of misinformation or feigning of a protected status on the one hand and the death, injury or capture of the adversary on the other hand is required in order to establish accountability of armed forces, as – in the traditional understanding of warfare – all military actions always pursue death, injury or capture of the adversary, see M. Bothe, K.J. Partsch &amp; W.A. Solf, *New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts. Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949* (The Hague / Boston / London, Martinus Nijhoff, 1982), Art. 37 (1) AP I, no. 2.4, p. 204.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nappears perfectly realistic, but contains false information, for example on planned military operations or on the status of own forces and their location. Such a honey net could be established specifically in the hope that the adversary Party would compromise it and – in this way – obtain false information.\n## ii. Methods or Means of Warfare Prohibited Because of the Nature of Their Effects\nSome methods or means of warfare are prohibited because of the nature of their effects.\nAccording to Article 51(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. This ban refers to the dissemination of certain information to the civilian population. As this information could be easily transmitted by means of computer-based information systems, for example via e-mail or as information on a website, this prohibition must be considered during the planning and the conduct of CNO.\nFurthermore, Article 23(e) HR, Article 35(2) AP I, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980 and its Protocols¹⁰⁴ as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 prohibit the employment of methods or means of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Equally, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57(2)(a)(iii) AP I stipulate that an attack which may be expected to cause loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. As it is perfectly possible that a cyber attack could indirectly cause physical damage (see supra II.1.C), it must be examined beforehand whether the anticipated (indirect) effect would be excessive in the sense of the above-mentioned provisions.¹⁰⁵ In this regard, as the expected effects of concrete CNO\n¹⁰⁴ Those are: Protocol on Non-Detectable Fragments (Protocol I) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III) of 1980, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV) of 1995, and Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V) of 2003.\n¹⁰⁵ See E.T. Jensen, ‘Unexpected Consequences from Knock-Out Effects: A Different\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nare to be assessed, the practical criteria for the examination resemble to ones for the analysis of the effects caused by other (e.g. conventional) weapons.\nMoreover, according to Article 51(4) AP I indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Attacks are deemed to be indiscriminate, when they are not or cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or when their effects cannot be limited (see Art. 51(4)(a)-(c) AP I). It is perfectly possible that CNO equated to an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello) or an “act of violence” (see III.1.B.) could have indiscriminate effects, in the case of global, uncontrolled spreading of viruses, bugs and – in future – micro-mechanical organisms via the Internet. However, damaging software could be programmed in such a way so as to only target computer systems with specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. An uncontrolled spread of malware, as well as any cascade effects, could be easily prevented by appropriate programming.\nHowever, the vast majority of malicious CNO will not achieve the quality of a “method or means of combat, the effects of which are indiscriminate”. The inductive conclusion drawn from the examples given by Articles 51(4)(a) and (b) AP I shows that the provisions refer to methods or means of combat which result in physically “devastating” physical effects.\nFinally, Article 35(3) in connection with Article 55(1) AP I prohibits the employment of methods or means of warfare which may be expected to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. This provision covers only especially extensive, intensive and long-lasting environmental damage, which exceeds the scale of both the quality and quantity of “ordinary” environmental damage which is expected to occur in the course of combat.[108] Severe damage of the natural environment can always be caused when dangerous forces are set free, such as by radiation escaping from a nuclear power plant, the explosion of a chemical or pharmacy installation, or the breaking of a dam or dyke. As such effects could be caused indirectly by CNO\nStandard for Computer Network Operations?', Vol. 18 American University LL.Rev. 2003, pp. 1178 et seq.; and Schmitt, supra note 28, p. 82.\n106 See also M.N.

In regard to the temporal scope of the damages see respective quotations and references in regard to the course of negotiations of AP I at Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 55 AP I, no. 2.4.1., p. 346.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(see supra II.1.C), the prohibition of Article 35(3) AP I must be also considered for operations primarily conducted within “cyberspace”.\n## B. Prohibited Targets\nFurthermore, LOAC provisions granting protection for non-combatants and for civilian objects are of significance for CNO.\n### i. Civilians Population and Individual Civilians\nThe civilian population as a whole, as well as individual civilians (see Art. 50 AP I), are protected against “attacks”¹⁰⁹, “acts of violence”¹¹⁰ and “effects of hostilities”¹¹¹. Accordingly, CNO which are not deemed as being “use of force”, and thus not comprising an “attack” (in the meaning of *ius in bello*), “act of violence” or “effect of hostilities” (see supra III.1.B) would not be contrary to LOAC and – from the perspective of international humanitarian law – could legally be directed against civilians¹¹².\nConversely, CNO considered as being a “use of force” could only be directed against civilians launching malicious CNO against the armed forces constituting “direct participation in hostilities” within the meaning of Article 51(3) AP I and Article 13(3) AP II¹¹³. In order to distinguish between private hacking as “direct participation in hostilities” and hacking as a mere criminal act, all circumstances of a specific case must be taken into consideration (see also supra II.2).\nFurthermore, according to Article 48 AP I, the Parties to an armed conflict must, at all times, distinguish between the civilian population\n¹⁰⁹ See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52(1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n¹¹⁰ See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Art. 13(2) AP II.\n¹¹¹ See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n¹¹² Concurring: Schmitt, supra note 106, p. 378.\n¹¹³ The examination of the different approaches to the question of the direct participation of civilians in hostilities, and especially of the temporal scope of the loss of protection otherwise granted by international humanitarian law, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further examination, the following literature may be recommended selectively: N. Melzer, *Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities* (Geneva, ICRC, May 2009), available at www.icrc.org; Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 51 AP I, no. 2.4.2.2., p. 303; M.N. Schmitt, ‘Direct Participation in Hostilities and 21st Century Armed Conflict’, in H. Fischer, U. Froissart, W.H. von Heinegg &amp; C. Raap (Hrsg.), *Krisensicherung und humanitärer Schutz – Crisis Management and Humanitarian Protection. Festschrift für Dieter Fleck* (Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), pp. 505–529.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nand combatants. Admittedly, the conventional (visual) criteria for the identification of a combatant as set out in Articles 43 and 44 AP I are not helpful for CNO, during which the acting individuals are not physically visible.¹¹⁴ However, the obligation to distinguish can also be met within “cyberspace”. In the “virtual world”, a computer of a combatant can be distinguished from the computer of a non-combatant according to its IP address and other technical data automatically sent during an Internet session. It can easily be verified by everybody in one of the official WhoIs?¹¹⁵ Internet databases to which person or entity a specific IP address or an IP address range is assigned. In addition, the “owner” and the responsible administrators of websites can be found in the WhoIs? databases. Thus, in principle it can be confirmed whether a particular actor in the “virtual world” should be considered as a member of the armed forces or as a civilian.\nNevertheless, some challenges as to the identification of a person acting in the “cyberspace” as a combatant will remain. For example, a member of regular armed forces and thus a combatant will not be recognizable as such when using his private computer at home, the latter sending during an Internet session information identifying the user as a civilian. This resembles the “real world” situation, when a soldier is not wearing the uniform when being at home and thus cannot visually be identified as a combatant as well. Thus, the remaining challenges are not new and will mostly resemble similar “real world” cases.\n## ii. Civilian Objects\nAccording to Article 48 AP I, civilian objects must be distinguished from military objectives. Civilian objects must not be the objects of attack or reprisals (Articles 48, 52(1)-(2) and 57 AP I, see also Art. 23(g) HR and further specific regulations in Articles 53–56 AP I and Articles 14–16 AP II). Generally, this principle of distinction, as well as the above-mentioned prohibitions, can also be observed within the “virtual world”.\n¹¹⁴ See the profound examination by S. Watts, ‘Combatant Status and Computer Network Attack’, Vol. 50 No. 2 Virginia J.I.L. 2010, pp. 391–447.\n¹¹⁵ The WhoIs? databases of the RIRs (see supra note 58) provide information on which IP address is assigned to which end customer (in the case of dynamic IP-addresses: to which Internet Service Provider). Thus, the database DENIC (available at http://www.denic.de) provides respective information on “.de” domains, and the database RIPE (available at http://www.ripe.net) on the other domains in Europe, InterNIC (available at http://www.internic.net/whois.html) on the domains “com”, “edu”, “int”, “net” or “org”. The database Network Information Center (available at http://www.nic.com) leads to official and regional WhoIs? databases as well as to respective private databases available online.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nViruses, bugs and – in the future – micro-mechanical organisms can be programmed in such a way that they only affect military computer networks, namely those with corresponding IP addresses or IP address ranges. The identification of a computer or computer system as military or civilian can be made by a search request of a specific IP address in one of the Whols? databases (see supra III.2.B.i).\nMalicious CNO against a purely military computer network, such as the Intranet or other communication systems of armed forces supported by the Intranet, would be perfectly legal in regard to LOAC. CNO launched against civilian computer networks – in case they are not to be considered as military objectives pursuant to Article 52(2) AP I – would only be allowed when they are not to be considered as an “attack” in the sense of Article 49(1) AP I, i.e. would not cause any physical damage (see supra III.1.B). A mere suppression or denial of access of the civilian population to a computer network or to specific data as well as the mere manipulation or the deletion of particular data would not fall under the prohibition of attack, as long as physical damage in- or outside the directly affected networks is not caused. For example, the deletion of a particular electronically operated bank account of a civilian would not be forbidden as a matter of LOAC.\nDistinction between civilian objects and military objectives becomes difficult when a computer network is used by both combatants and non-combatants (so-called dual use objects). This applies especially to the global Internet where, apart from the civilian population, there is a high probability that it will also be used by Parties to an armed conflict for the purposes of communication and information gathering. According to some scholars, the Internet is to be deemed as a military objective as soon as it is also used for military purposes.[116] Considering that nowadays the Internet is as an equally important means of communication as telephone and telegraph connections were in the past, the aforementioned opinion is supported by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had already in 1956 classified the latter as military objectives.[117]\n[116] This assertion is made in general terms, referring to communication networks used for both military and civilian purposes by Jensen, supra note 105, pp. 1160 et seq.; J.P. Terry, ‘The Lawfulness of Attacking Computer Networks in Armed Conflict and in Self-Defense in Period Short of Armed Conflict: What are the Targeting Constrains?’, Vol. 169 Mil. L. Rev. 2001, p. 85; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 35. Similarly: Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, no. 2.4.2., p. 324.\n[117] Annex Military Targets to the Draft Rules for the Limitation of Dangers Incurred\n82\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nHowever, some scholars refuse to classify civilian means of communication merely co-used for military purposes as a military objective.¹¹⁸ Indeed, in order to avoid any “automatism”, a thorough examination of the definition of a military objective provided by Article 52(2) AP I will be necessary. The definition clearly refers to objects only. Thus, at first sight, it seems doubtful whether the “virtual world” of the Internet can be deemed to be an object. However, the computer system Internet is not a purely intellectual construction. It comprises a multitude of objects, including technical equipment as servers, cables, cross points and access points; thus, the provision is in general applicable to the Internet. According to this definition, the computer system Internet or any other (dual use) computer network is to be considered as a military objective, if\n- the computer network makes an effective contribution¹¹⁹ to military action by its use, and\n- the total or partial destruction or neutralization of the computer network offered a definite (i.e. concrete and perceptible)¹²⁰ military advantage (in regard to the overall military operation).¹²¹\nWhether the Internet meets these conditions depends on the degree to which the other Party to the armed conflict uses the Internet, and whether this Party can easily revert to alternative communication means. Therefore, the characterisation of the Internet, or other dual use computer networks, as a military objective depends on the circumstances of the specific situation, especially on the degree of the dependence of the adversary Party on those networks, *ergo* on the level of the technologisation of the adversary armed forces.\nEven if the Internet was to be considered to be a military objective in the context of a particular armed conflict, it must be considered that it would be allowed to be attacked only as far as its physical elements\nby the Civilian Population in Time of War, see Fleck, supra note 66, § 443. von Heinegg, supra note 77, pp. 150 seq.\n¹¹⁸ The examination, whether the “contribution” shall have a particular significance for or shall merely support a certain military operation, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further details see Fleck, supra note 66, § 442; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.3., p. 324.\n¹²⁰ See R. Wedgwood, ‘Proportionality, Cyberwar and the Law of War’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 225; and von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 150.\n¹²¹ Wedgwood, supra note 120, p. 225; Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 149; Fleck, supra note 66, § 444; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.4. See also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) of the ICC Statute.\n83\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(e.g. server, cross points and WLAN¹²² access points) are located on the territory of one of the Parties to the particular armed conflict. But, even if such an attack was conducted successfully, a connection to the Internet could still be made from the same geographical area, for example via a mobile phone or other device enabled with respective software permitting Internet connectivity. Thus, an attack against the Internet intending the *quasi* disabling of a network within the area of conflict is unlikely to succeed.¹²³\n### iii. Objects under Special Protection\nAdditionally, LOAC provides special protection against attacks and reprisals for specific civilian objects. Corresponding prohibitions can be found in Article 27 HR, Articles 19-21 GC I., Articles 22 and 24 GC II., Articles 18 *et seq.* GC IV, Article 4 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954 and in its Protocol I of 1954 and Protocol II of 1999, Articles 12, 21, 24 *et seq.*, 54(2) and (4) and 56 AP I as well as in Articles 11 and 14–16 AP II. Pursuant to these provisions, special protection is provided for dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (*inter alia* drinking water installations and water irrigation works), medical units and transportation, historic monuments, works of art or places of worship etc. As far as incorporating computer-based elements, the above-mentioned objects could be disrupted or even destroyed by the means of a cyber attack. Therefore, the computer-based cooling system of a nuclear power plant, for example, must not be disabled by remote control, a drinking water installation must not be destroyed by a computer controlled opening and closing of its valves, a medical aircraft must not be caused to crash by manipulation of data of an air traffic control system, or a museum protected by *ius in bello* must not be flooded by the remote activation of a water sprinkler system.\n¹²² In general terms, a *Wireless Local Area Network* (WLAN) describes a local wireless and direct connection between two or more mobile end devices (*clients*), which are equipped with a wireless access device. Usually, *clients* access the Internet via a central bridge (so-called *access point*). The bridge has a *router*, which – based on a *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol* (DHPC server) – assigns a dynamic IP address to each *host* (see also *supra* note 58) seeking connectivity to the Internet.\n¹²³ In order to disable the Internet, all its thirteen *root servers* (i.e. the main *domain name servers* or the main server layer of the internet) would have to be disconnected or destroyed. For security reasons, those servers are located in different, secret sites which are geographically distant. It is asserted that disabling up to ten of the *root servers* would probably merely delay the data transfer via the Internet.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nGenerally speaking, the aforementioned provisions, which provide special protection for specific civilian objects, can cease in the event that the objects are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy or for regular, significant and direct support for military operations of the enemy. In general terms, an active counter-CNO (back-hacking) could be legally launched once a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit to stop the forbidden activities, and after such warning has remained unheeded. For example, in the case of the computer network of a medical unit, if it had been identified as the location of origin of malicious CNO, as an exception, an active counter-CNO could be launched if a warning about the forthcoming back-hacking had been given in advance, for instance in the form of a pop-up window which would appear on the computer screen of the cyber attacker.\nIt should also be considered that as far as an attack against an object is forbidden, the enemy must not be led to attack such objects. Therefore, CNO which would correspondingly manipulate a targeting database of the adversary Party to the armed conflict in order to assign the data of the geographical coordinates of a civilian object under special protection to the data of a military objective of the adversary Party would be forbidden. As an example, when manipulating the adversary's targeting database, a munitions factory must not be assigned the geographical coordinates of a hospital.\n## 3. The Law of Neutrality and the Cyberspace\nFirst of all, neutrality in the sense of *ius in bellum* has to be distinguished from permanent neutrality (e.g. the cases of Austria, the Holy See, and Switzerland), i.e. the legal obligation undertaken in peacetime to remain neutral in cases of armed conflict or war between other States, and from the mere neutrality policy (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Ireland), which, nonetheless, can have some legally binding effects due to the situation of confidence created in which other States may rely on the (political) declarations to remain neutral (principle of estoppel).¹²⁴\n## A. The Applicability of the Law of Neutrality\nNeutrality is a particular status of a State not Party to an armed conflict of significant scope or – according to a traditional view – to a “war\n¹²⁴ Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1105.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin the legal sense” between other States.¹²⁵ Although it is not crucial for the purposes of the present survey to decide which view is to be followed, it may be mentioned that the International Court of Justice stated in its Advisory Opinion on the *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* of 8 July 1996 that “[...] the principle of neutrality [...] is applicable [...], to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used”.¹²⁶ However, it must always be taken into consideration that in particular cases the rules governing neutrality may be modified by collective self-defence provisions such as Article 51 UN Charter and Article 5 North Atlantic Treaty (depriving a State of the possibility to legally join an armed conflict or a war on the side of the aggressor) and by (binding) decisions taken by the UN Security Council (see Articles 2(5) and 25 and Chapter VII UN Charter; the obligation to assist any action taken by the UN in accordance with the Charter would forestall a State to appeal to its neutrality).¹²⁷\nIn the following it will be shown that the rules on neutrality – which are over 100 years old – apply to military operations conducted in cyberspace (during an armed conflict of significant scope or a “war in the legal sense”). When examining the law of neutrality, no difference will be made between the specific rules applying to land, air or sea warfare, as the distinction between these areas is not relevant to CNO.\n## B. Prohibition of CNO Causing Physical Damage\nFirst and foremost, the rules of neutrality protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the neutral State, see Article 1 Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907 (HC V) and Art. 1 Hague Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 1907 (HC XIII).\nThus, the principle of neutrality prohibits causing physical damage on the sovereign territory of a neutral State.¹²⁸ Consequently, a malicious\n¹²⁵ The discussion of the question, whether rules on neutrality apply in situations of war (in legal sense) only or also in situations of an armed conflict of significant scope, would exceed the scope of the present survey. Interested readers may be referred to the assessment in Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1106.\n¹²⁶ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90 (emphasis by the author).\n¹²⁷ See further details at Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1103; and G. Walker, ‘Information Warfare and Neutrality’, Vol. 33 *Vanderbilt J. Transnational L.* 2000, pp. 1079 et seq.\n¹²⁸ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90. Regarding the necessary criteria of a “physical encroachment”\n86\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nCNO would only breach the principle of the territorial inviolability of a neutral State if it – indirectly – caused physical damage (deaths, injuries or destruction of property) on the territory of a neutral State or medium to long-term disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a neutral State (see supra III.1.A.vi). In this regard, the physical damage could refer to physical components (technical equipment) of the Internet and/or other computer systems as well as to objects/living beings outside the affected computer systems.\nIn regard to critical infrastructure systems, it must always be considered that they can be shared by several States (e.g. an electricity distribution system is shared between Laos and Thailand, between Venezuela and Brazil, between Canada and the United States and between Indonesia and Singapore; one telecommunication system is shared by several States in East and South-East Asia).[129] Thus, before targeting a critical infrastructure system of the adversary it must always be examined (in addition to other LOAC provisions relevant to targeting) whether the estimated damage could also automatically affect another State neutral to the particular armed conflict or war.\n# C. The Use of Telecommunication Means Belonging to a Neutral State\nAccording to Article 8 HC V, a neutral State can allow the belligerents to use \"telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals\". The neutral State also has the right to restrict or prohibit the use of such communication means, if applied (by the State, companies or individuals) impartially to all belligerents (see Article 9 HC V and 9(1) HC XIII).\nIn regard to the Internet, such a restriction or prohibition could be enforced by a neutral State by applying certain software to all Internet cross points located on its territory. The software would scan the Internet traffic for data packages sent by the belligerents and delete them. Of course, a neutral State could also disable all technical components supporting the worldwide network Internet and located on its territory. This way, the belligerents would not use the Internet components located on the territory of the neutral State, although the Internet system as such would continue to function and could be further used by the Parties to the armed conflict or war.\nsee Greenberg, Goodman &amp; Soo Hoo, supra note 75, p. 10.\n129 W. Church, ‘Information Warfare’, Vol. 82 No. 837 I.R.R.C. 2000, p. 210.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nIn the case one Party of the armed conflict or war used the computer network located on the territory of a neutral State to send malicious CNO to the computer systems of the other belligerent – either by launching malicious CNO from neutral State’s territory or by using Internet cross points or other technical equipment located on its territory –, the neutral State would have the right to “protect” its neutral status by taking appropriate actions (e.g. back-hacking). If it failed to do so, the neutral State would have – pursuant to the principle of non-discrimination of belligerents – the obligation to allow the affected belligerent to take action against the malicious CNO.^[130]^\n## D. Data Streams Passing the Territory of a Neutral State\nHowever, it is perfectly possible, even likely, that in the course of the conduct of CNO the data stream carrying malicious components (e.g. viruses or worms) to the adversary’s computer systems passes Internet crossing points and servers located on the territory of a neutral State. However, this would not result in violation of neutrality law.\nFirst of all, a Party to a conflict cannot influence whether a data stream crosses the technical components of the Internet situated on the territory of a neutral State or not. Every data stream sent via the Internet is divided in data packages, each one of which takes – out of millions possible routs – a certain route from cross point to cross point around the globe. The respective choices are done automatically by the Internet system (depending on the traffic load on the routes) and cannot be foreseen or influenced.^[131]^\nFurthermore, according to Article 3(a) HC V and Article 5 HC XIII, a Party to an armed conflict or war is only forbidden to “[e]rect on the territory [including territorial waters] of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea”, and pursuant to Article 3(b) HC V to “[u]se any installation of this kind established by them [i.e. belligerents] before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages”. This means that belligerents are allowed to use all non-purely military means of communication erected or established on the territory of a neutral State – by whomever – before the armed conflict or war. This would apply to all technical installations on the territory of\n^[130]^ Jensen, *supra* note 105, pp. 238 et seq.\n^[131]^ Walker, *supra* note 127, pp. 1079 et seq.\n88\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nthe neutral State being part of the worldwide, already existing computer network Internet, as it is – also historically – a communication means used by civilians also. It is asserted within academic writings that the establishment of a connection to the Internet as such should be deemed as similar to the forbidden “erecting” of a “communication apparatus”.¹³² However, it is more convincing to compare the establishment of a connection to the Internet to connecting to the worldwide telephone system by dialling a phone number – which would surely not be considered as forbidden “erecting” a “communication apparatus” by a belligerent.\nFinally, it must be endorsed that, because the law of neutrality does provide special provisions referring to communication systems on land or in territorial waters (Art. 3 HC V and Art. 5 HC XIII), there is no need or space for an (analogous) application of rules relating to the innocent passage through territorial waters, as asserted in some scholar writings.¹³³\n## IV. Concluding Remarks\nGiven the developments in technology and reliance on computer systems, in the future, CNO are likely to be of considerable significance for the planning and conduct of military operations. One of the reasons is that both the equipment and the conduct of CNO are extremely inexpensive when compared to conventional military operations. In addition, CNO can be conducted by only a few experts and from any location distant from the (traditional) area of combat, which safeguards the physical protection of the members of armed forces involved. Furthermore, as mentioned above, within the context of so-called asymmetric warfare, CNO can be a powerful weapon in the hands of non-state actors against the technologically highly developed armed forces of post-industrial States sensitive to malfunctions of their computer networks.\nOwing to the potential physical effects of CNO, the Parties to any future armed conflict in which CNO will be carried out, either in support of conventional military abilities or as the only method of war fighting conducted, will have to observe relevant LOAC provisions. The spirit and purpose of these protection granting rules, as well as the values they reflect, are timeless. They offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n¹³² *Id.*\n¹³³ Such an assertion is made by Walker, *supra* note 127.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nNeither a lack of regulation nor a need for amendment of “aged” norms can be identified, when a teleological interpretation of the provisions is applied.\nThe future practice of the armed forces will show whether adjustments in the interpretation of relevant LOAC provisions will have to be made. The practice of the international community will decide, whether in the future it will be considered necessary to increase the level of the humanitarian protection during armed conflicts, and thus to include protection e.g. of data contained in computers or computer networks of non-combatants. Unquestionably, lawyers advising armed forces will have ever more to deal with corresponding questions of law and to understand the technical details of CNO as an emerging weapon, means or method of war.\n90\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## Summary – Résumé – Samenvatting – Zusammenfassung – Riassunto – Resumen\n## Summary – Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nThe Internet has become the most essential means of communication and information. This results in a high dependency upon reliable operations of Internet based communication systems, especially those supporting critical infrastructure systems. Given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to security, the vulnerability of computer systems has become a significant matter of (national or collective) security to many States as well as to NATO. The potential conduct of “Computer Network Operations” (CNO), i.e. military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks, presents some legal challenges. This survey first examines the nature of CNO and discusses the difficulties of identification of the origin and of attribution of a malicious action carried out via or in the cyberspace to a certain actor. After the presentation of some criteria for the qualification of CNO as “use of armed force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning), the survey argues that the Laws of Armed Conflict, including the over hundred years old principles and provisions of neutrality, do apply to CNO. At the same time, it demonstrates that the provisions offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n## Résumé – Les Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques et le Droit des Confits Armés\nL’internet est devenu un moyen de communication et d’information indispensable. Il en résulte une grande dépendance envers la fiabilité du fonctionnement des systèmes de communication basé sur l’internet, particulièrement ceux au soutien d’infrastructures critiques. Étant donné les insuffisances de l’internet en matière de sécurité, la vulnérabilité des systèmes d’ordinateurs est devenue un sujet important pour la sécurité (nationale et collective) de plusieurs États ainsi que pour l’OTAN. La conduite éventuelle d’Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques (OCRI), à savoir des actions militaires offensives ou défensives prises grâce aux moyens mêmes de l’internet ou de réseaux d’ordinateurs, présente quelques défis juridiques. Cet article examine d’abord la nature des OCRI et discute des difficultés associées à l’identification de l’origine et de l’attribution à un acteur précis d’une action malicieuse\n91\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nexécutée à travers ou au sein du cyber espace. Après avoir présenté quelques critères pour qualifier les OCRI comme étant une utilisation de la force armée (au sens *ius in bello*) l'auteur soutient ensuite que le droit des conflits armés ainsi que les principes et dispositions plus que centenaire en matière de neutralité s'appliquent aux OCRI. Par la même occasion, l'article démontre que ces dispositions offrent un niveau de protection humanitaire qui est comparable à celui en vigueur pour l'utilisation des armes classiques.\n## Samenvatting – Computer netwerk operaties en het humanitair oorlogsrecht\nHet Internet is uitgegroeid tot het belangrijkste communicatie- en informatiemiddel. Dit heeft geleid tot een grote afhankelijkheid van op Internet gebaseerde communicatiesystemen, vooral van die systemen die kritische infrastructuur ondersteunen. Door de beperkingen van het Internet op het gebied van beveiliging, is de kwetsbaarheid van computersystemen een zaak van (nationale of collectieve) veiligheid geworden voor veel staten en voor de NAVO. Computer netwerk operaties (CNO), dat wil zeggen defensieve of offensieve militaire handelingen door middel van Internet of andere computernetwerken, roept juridische vragen op. Dit artikel onderzoekt eerst wat CNO is en bespreekt de moeilijkheden rond het identificeren van de bron van en toerekening aan een bepaalde actor van een vijandige handeling die in of via cyberspace wordt uitgevoerd. Nadat een aantal criteria voor de kwalificatie van CNO als geweldgebruik (in de zin van het *ius in bello*) zijn geponeerd, beargumenteert het artikel dat het humanitair oorlogsrecht, waaronder de principes en regels betreffende neutraliteit die meer dan honderd jaar oud zijn, zich lenen voor toepassing op CNO. Aangetoond wordt dat de bepalingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht binnen dit domein een niveau van bescherming bieden dat vergelijkbaar is met het niveau dat van toepassing is op het gebruik van conventionele wapens.\n## Zusammenfassung – Computernetwerkoperationen und das humanitäre Völkerrecht\nDas Internet wurde zu einem essentiellen Kommunikations- und Informationsmittel unserer Zeit. Dies führte zu einer hochgradigen Abhängigkeit von der Funktionsfähigkeit der auf dem Internet basierenden Kommunikationssysteme. Dies gilt insbesondere für diejenigen Systeme, die kritische Infrastruktursysteme eines Staates\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nunterstützen. Da das Internet in Bezug auf die Sicherheit Mängel aufweist, wurde die Integrität von Computersystemen für manche Staaten so wie auch für die NATO zu einer Frage der (nationalen bzw. kollektiven) Sicherheit. Das potenzielle Durchführen von Computernetzwerkoperationen (CNO), d.h. defensiven oder offensiven Handlungen der Streitkräfte unter Inanspruchnahme des Internet oder anderer Computernetzwerke, bietet einige Herausforderungen rechtlicher Art. In dem vorliegenden Artikel wird zunächst die Natur von CNO dargelegt. Ferner werden die Schwierigkeiten in Bezug auf die Identifizierung des Ursprungs und die Zurechnung einer im virtuellen Raum vorgenommenen schädigenden Handlung zu einem bestimmten Akteur erörtert. Nachdem einige Kriterien für die Einordnung von CNO als „Anwendung bewaffneter Gewalt“ (im Sinne des *ius in bello*) vorgestellt werden, wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht, einschließlich der über hundert Jahre alten Prinzipien und Regelungen des Neutralitätsrechts, auf CNO anwendbar ist. Zugleich wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht hierbei einen humanitären Schutzstandard bietet, der demjenigen gleicht, der bei der Anwendung konventioneller Waffen gilt.\n## Riassunto – Computer Network Operations e il diritto dei conflitti armati\nLa rete internet è divenuta il più importante mezzo di comunicazione ed informazione dell’era contemporanea. Ciò determina una sostanziale dipendenza dal corretto funzionamento dei sistemi di comunicazione basati su tale rete, specialmente per ciò che concerne quelli di sostegno ad infrastrutture critiche. Vista la scarsa sicurezza della comunicazione via internet, la vulnerabilità dei sistemi informatici è diventata una questione di rilievo per la sicurezza (nazionale o collettiva) di molti stati e per la NATO. La potenziale condotta di ‘Operazioni militari su reti informatiche’ (*Computer Network Operations – CNO*), ovvero operazioni militari difensive o offensive scatenate tramite internet o per altra via informatica, presenta tuttavia talune incertezze dal punto di vista giuridico. Dapprima questo articolo esamina la vera natura delle CNO, mettendo in luce le difficoltà di identificazione e attribuzione di un’azione delittuosa portata avanti nello spazio cibernetico (o mediante quest’ultimo), a danno di un determinato soggetto. Successivamente, dopo aver presentato alcuni criteri guida per una corretta qualificazione delle CNO come un vero e proprio “uso della forza armata” (secondo lo *ius in bello*), l’articolo dimostra che il diritto dei conflitti armati, assieme agli ultra-centenari principi e norme sulla neutralità, trova applicazione\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin caso di CNO. Allo stesso modo, lo scritto evidenzia come tali norme offrano un livello di protezione umanitaria comparabile con quello applicabile nel caso di uso di armi convenzionali.\n## Resumen – Operaciones a través de la red informática y Derecho de los Conflictos Armados.\nInternet ha acabado por convertirse en un importante medio de comunicación e información de la era contemporánea. Esto lleva consigo un alto grado de dependencia con respecto a los sistemas de comunicación centrados en la red, especialmente por lo que se refiere a los sistemas que sirven de apoyo a infraestructuras vitales. Vista la escasa seguridad de las comunicaciones a través de internet, la vulnerabilidad de los sistemas de información se ha convertido en una cuestión prioritaria para la seguridad (nacional y colectiva) de muchos Estados así como para la OTAN. Las conductas potenciales que pueden ser objeto de las operaciones a través de la red informática (Computer Network Operations – CNO), como por ejemplo acciones militares tanto ofensivas como defensivas llevadas a cabo a través de internet o de otras redes de información, presentan aspectos interesantes desde el punto de vista jurídico. El presente artículo examina en primer lugar la naturaleza de las CNO y analiza las dificultades que existen para identificar el sistema en el que tiene su origen un ataque y la posterior atribución de una conducta delictiva llevada a cabo en el espacio cibernético (o a través de este último) a un sujeto determinado. Tras la exposición de algunos criterios que permiten calificar las CNO como “uso de fuerza armada” (en el sentido del *ius in bello*), el artículo demuestra que el Derecho de los Conflictos Armados resulta de aplicación a las CNO, incluidos los principios y preceptos ultra-centenarios relativos a la neutralidad. Al mismo tiempo, pone de manifiesto cómo ese Derecho ofrece un nivel de protección humanitaria comparable con el que es de aplicación en el campo del uso de armas convencionales.",

Introduction\nIn this day and age, the Internet is one of the most important means of communication and information. During the last 30 years it has gradually become an essential aspect of the economy in a globalized world and plays an indispensable role in, amongst other things, the administrative and judicial systems of technologically developed countries. All in all, critical infrastructure systems in States with high levels of technology dependency are acutely reliant upon reliable and effective operations of Internet based communication systems. Thus, given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to the security, protection and defence of the integrity of computer networks, the vulnerability of these communication systems has become a significant matter of national security to many such States. Accordingly, the current National Security Strategies of the USA, of the United Kingdom,\n The Internet is globally administered by a Californian (US) non-profit, public-benefit corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which, in the framework of a Public Private Partnership, is associated with and reports to the US Department of Commerce (although, according to the information on ICANN’s website, the organisation heavily emphasises its international nature and independence). ICANN bears global responsibility for ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet as well as for coordinating the Internet system of unique identifiers, i.e. for the assignment of IP-address ranges (since 2005 not directly to users but to regional organisations – see infra note 58). It is further responsible for the generic codes and country codes of the Internet top level domain as well as for the management and maintenance of the (secret) Internet root server system (see infra note 122). ICANN is the successor organization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which was executing the above-mentioned tasks directly on behalf of the US Department of Commerce (information available at http://www.icann/org/en/factsheets/factsheet.html; unless indicated otherwise, all URLs cited in the present survey were last visited on 31 November 2010). Originally, it was planned to transform ICANN into an independent organization in October 2006. During the 2nd World Summit on the Information Society, organized by the UN in Tunis in November 2005, it was proposed to submit ICANN (and thus the Internet itself) to management by the UN. The USA rejected this proposal and declared its intent to keep the control over ICANN for the time being (information available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/).\n The President of the United States of America, National Security Strategy (May 2010), p. 27 et seq., available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf.\n Her Majesty’s Government, A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The National Security Strategy (October 2010), pp. 11 and 27, available at http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191639.pdf?CID=PDF&amp;PLA=furl&amp;CRE=nationalsecuritystrategy.\n\nand Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defence White Paper, all seek to address the issue of cyber-attacks. According to NATO’s new Strategic Concept of 19 November 2010, cyber threats are one of the major perils for the security of the Alliance in the future decade. Similar concerns are reflected in resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly over the last ten years, which regularly mention the integrity of information and communication technology in the context of international security and call for the creation of a global “culture of cyber security”.

In order to ensure NATO’s permanent and unfettered access to cyberspace and integrity of its critical systems, we will take into account the cyber dimension of modern conflicts in NATO’s doctrine and improve its capabilities to detect, assess, prevent, defend and recover in case of a cyber attack against systems of critical importance to the Alliance. We will strive in particular to accelerate NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) to Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2012 and the bringing of all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection. We will use NATO’s defence planning processes in order to promote the development of Allies’ cyber defence capabilities, to assist individual Allies upon request, and to optimize information sharing, collaboration and interoperability. To address the security risks emanating from cyberspace, we will work closely with other actors, such as the UN and the EU, as agreed. We have tasked the Council to develop, drawing notably on existing international structures and on the basis of a review of our current policy, a NATO in-depth cyber defence policy by June 2011 and to prepare an action plan for its implementation”; available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_68828.htm.\n See the resolutions Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, UN Documents A/53/70 of 4 December 1998, A/54/49 of 1 December 1999, A/55/28 of 20 November 2000, A/56/19 of 29 November 2001, A/57/53 of 22 November 2002, A/58/32 of 8 December 2003, A/59/61 of 3 December 2004, A/60/45 of 8 December 2005, A/61/55 of 6 December 2006, and A/62/17 of 5 December 2007. With regard to the creation of a global culture of cyber security, see the resolutions Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information structures,\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nthe Internet for terrorist purposes (cyber terrorism) is currently on the agendas of several international initiatives and programmes.7\nMilitary forces use the Internet for communication purposes and – to a certain extent – as an inherent component of particular weapon systems. Additionally, the Internet offers the possibility for offensive and/or defensive military actions by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. The military term “Computer Network Operations” (CNO) refers, generally speaking, to computer hacking and back-hacking in the context of a military operation.\nWorldwide, military forces are preparing for the fight in cyberspace. It has been alleged that Israeli armed forces have engaged in CNO activities since the early 1990s.8 The USA established a US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in Fort Meade, Maryland on 23 June 2009 (operational as of October 2010) which unified the already existing cyber capabilities of the US National Security Agency and several US military services (Army Forces Cyber Command, 24th US Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command).9 According to media reports, Belgium10, Germany11, South Korea12 (allegedly in reaction to respective North Korean endeavours), and the\nUN Documents A/55/63 of 4 December 2000, A/56/121 of 19 December 2001, A/57/239 of 20 December 2002, and A/58/199 of 23 December 2003.\n\nUnited Kingdom (Government Communications Headquarters) have established similar commands in 2009, while China did so in 2010.\nUndeniably, CNO have become an important weapon, means or method of warfare extending the – traditionally clearly defined – battlefield to the global cyberspace. Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n See C. Clark, ‘StratCom Plows Ahead on Cyber’, Online Defense and Acquisition Journal of 29 June 2009, available at http://www.dodbuzz.com/2009/06/29/stratcom-plows-ahead-on-cyber/.\n T. Branigen, ‘Chinese Army to Target Cyber War Threat’, Guardian online of 22 July 2010, available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/22/chinese-army-cyber-war-department.\n According to some reports, Chinese armed forces built up CNO capabilities already some years ago, see e.g. Northrop Grumman Corporation - Information Systems Sector, Capability of the People’s Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation (Report of 9 October 2009 Prepared for The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), available at http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## II. The Nature and Significance of CNO\nIn the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).\n## 1. Forms and Effects of CNO\nThe concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA).\nThe above-mentioned components of CNO are strongly interrelated. An adversary’s CNA can help one’s own CND when analysed appropriately. A CNE cannot be conducted without CNA, as the information to be gathered by CNE will mostly be protected by firewalls, passwords and other barriers that are erected to prevent an adversarial CNA. Finally, CNA cannot be conducted without CNE, as without information gathering on the targeted network’s architecture and systems the CNA would effectively be conducted blindly.\nWhile the practical value of the taxonomy of CND/CNE/CNA therefore is questionable, it will be presented in more detail below as most academic writings and media reports refer to this classification.\n## A. CND\nCND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\none’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone). The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies, merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA.\n## B. CNE\nAccording to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”. This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage.\nAccording to open source reports, the vast majority of CNO activities conducted during peacetime consist of CNE. For example, already in 2007, the British intelligence service MI5 warned all financial service providers and companies in Great Britain against concerted cyber espionage endeavours by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. In summer 2007, the computer systems of Germany’s Federal Chancellery as well as those of some federal ministries were infected with spyware (i.e. espionage software) reported to have originated from China. According to the Annual Report 2009 of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, computer systems of Germany’s federal and state governments and of private businesses were targeted by hundreds of (successful and/or unsuccessful) CNE. Foreign intelligence\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nservices were likely to be the organizers of, or are involved in, most of these. In the USA, over 100 foreign intelligence services currently endeavour to intrude computer systems located in the country, as the US Deputy Secretary of Defence stated in September 2010. NATO’s computer networks are also subject to constant – and partly successful – CNE.\nThere is no open source information as to the employment of CNE during an armed conflict. However, it can be assumed that CNE is very likely to be used in support of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance.\n## C. CNA\nCNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”. These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks.\nRelatively harmless, data modification in the course of a CNA can modify and deface a website (defacement). This is often conducted by hackers who wish to express their political view (hacktivism). Another widely spread form of CNA is the Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(DDoS-attack), which can cause delays in the data transfer process, the denial of access to computer systems or servers (e.g. the targeted websites or a email service) or result in the (only temporary) disabling of the targeted systems. The particular DDoS-techniques are as diverse as the – partly very effective – countermeasures developed since 2000.\nHowever, the deletion or modification of data in a successfully intruded computer network can be more hazardous. Hackers can generate wrong information, for instance in the military environment the content of electronically transmitted orders, plans and maps or the localization data of military targets contained in a targeting-database.\nMoreover, it is possible that a CNA could – indirectly – cause death, physical injury or physical destruction of property. As far as chemical plants, nuclear power stations, oil refinery installations, gas store installations or electrical power distribution installations have or rely on computer-based control systems, these systems could be penetrated and manipulated. Thus, a CNA could cause the explosion of a nuclear power plant if the cooling systems were disabled via remote control. The same applies to computer-based control systems of transportation systems. By manipulation of the rail points, train derailments or collisions could be caused; penetration and minimal amendments to the programming of an air traffic control system could result in aircraft incidents. Therefore, the classification of CNO as a non-lethal weapon, as asserted by some scholars, has to be challenged in this regard. Also, the general assertion made that CNO, in its current form would generally not violate LOAC, is questionable.\n\nAbove all, CNA can affect the functioning of a State, when manipulating or deleting data in computer systems of critical infrastructure systems. The list of critical infrastructure systems will slightly differ from State to State. By way of example, the following areas identified by the German Federal Office of Security of Information Technology (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) can be considered as critical infrastructure systems: transportation and traffic (postal services, local traffic, roads, rail system, aviation, sea and inland navigation); energy (nuclear plants, distribution and transfer systems of electricity, oil, gas); hazardous substances (chemical and biological agents, nuclear reactors); information and telecommunication technology; finance, currency and insurance (banks, insurance companies, financial service providers, stock markets); public utilities (health, emergency and rescue sector, disaster control, food and water supply, waste management); government, administration, justice, police, customs and armed forces.\nMany of these critical infrastructure systems are based on computer-based control systems, such as the generation and distribution of electricity or telecommunications. Some function entirely on the basis of an Internet connection, including the banking and stock exchange systems. Other areas are increasingly reliant on the Internet, for example the so-called e-justice and e-government. In any technologically highly developed, post-industrial State most of the critical infrastructure systems can be deemed to depend on the operability and efficiency of electronic data transfer. The devastating effects and the subsequent disruption of the ordre public caused by a CNA are limited only by the imagination of the reader. Therefore, cyber security plays a paramount role for the national security of many States and was noted as one of the major perils for the Alliance's security in NATO's Strategic Concept of 2010 (see supra I).\nThere is open source information available in the media on CNA being conducted during peacetime.\nThe only publicly known case, in which the attribution of a CNA to a particular State can be asserted, was the penetration and temporary disabling of Syrian air defence networks, especially the radar systems, by Israel on 6 September 2007, immediately followed by an airstrike by Israel's Air Force destroying Syria's Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Deir-Az-Zur.\n See the list of critical infrastructure systems, available at https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/Publikationen/Faltblaetter/F17KritischeInfrastruktur.html.\n Ben-David, supra note 8.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nA more prominent case of a successful CNA against a State are the DDoS-attacks launched against several critical infrastructure systems in Estonia during the 27 April – 18 May 2007 timeframe. The “attacks” targeted websites and communication channels of the government and commercial services. For example, the web-services of the major banks Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank were (at one-time) interrupted for 1,5 hours; the website of a governing coalition party was defaced; emergency phone numbers were disengaged for a short time; and three major Estonian Internet Service Providers and some online news providers were disconnected (although it is unclear for how long). The estimated physical (because of the disengagement of emergency phone numbers) and economic damage caused by the DDoS-attacks remains unclear. The attacks most probably originated from the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the relatively simple DDoS-methods and the political context of the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, it is asserted that the “attackers” were politically motivated private persons (hacktivism).\nAnother example of successful CNA during peacetime are the defacement and DDoS-attacks launched against Lithuania between 28 June and 1 July 2008. The CNA may have been connected either to the amendment of Lithuania’s laws to prohibit the display of symbols of the Soviet Union or the singing of its anthem in public or to the unilateral veto against discussions on an EU energy partnership deal with Russian Federation. Over 300 Lithuanian websites were defaced, including those of the Government. Given the pro-Russian contents\n\nof the defacement, as well as the subject of the (unsolicited) spam emails “Hackers United against external threats to Russia”, the CNA is assumed to have originated with nationalistic, private hacker groups (hacktivism).42\nOn the contrary, the “Conficker” worm, reported to have been created by Russian criminals, was not aimed at State structures, as it spread worldwide, affecting both private and official networks. It did gain national interest of the victim States, when it began to affect governmental and military computer systems, including those of the British Parliament,43 and the French and British air forces and navies.44\nThe worm “Stuxnet”, which affected over 100.000 computer systems worldwide between June and September 2010, targeted industrial control systems of gas pipelines and power plants based on Siemens software, aiming to establish remote control of the systems and to hide any changes in the computer systems from the operators of the equipment.45 As the vast majority of the infections affected Iran’s critical infrastructure systems, in particular of the nuclear power plant near Bushehr, and the worm’s reach and complexity obviously required enormous personnel and budgetary investments as well as a considerable amount of time to write the code (in secrecy), the involvement of a foreign organization or State is suspected.46\n\nAlthough there is no respective open source information, it must be assumed that, in the past, CNA were also successfully launched against NATO’s computer systems. The *Analysis and Recommendations of the Group of Experts on a New Strategic Concept for NATO* presented on 17 May 2010 noted: “Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern”.\nFurthermore, CNA were conducted during times of armed conflict, as for example during *Operation Allied Force* (24 March – 10 June 1999) launched by 10 NATO Member States against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the beginning of the operation, websites and the mailing system of NATO were blocked and infected by a virus (Melissa), apparently originating in Serbia. Furthermore, some defacement attacks were launched by politically motivated individuals (hacktivism) from Serbia and Russia (*Black Hand, From Russia with Love, Russian Hacker Union*, etc.) against websites of NATO and NATO Member States. Equally, some hackers groups (politically) supporting the NATO operation (e.g. *Dutchthreat* or *Kosovo Hackers Group*) tried to infiltrate the governmental websites of Yugoslavia. Moreover, it is suspected that the President of the USA, *Bill Clinton*, did authorize the *Central Intelligence Agency* (CIA) to penetrate the computer systems of banks in Greece, Lebanon, Russia and Cyprus in order to clear the banking accounts of the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia *Slobodan Milošević*. As the respective plans are said to have been\n‘Foreign-made’ ‘Stuxnet’ Computer Virus’, *The Washington Post* online of 27 September 2010, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092706229.html.\n NATO, *NATO 2020: Assured Security, Dynamic Engagement.

Those were DDoS-attacks and defacements mainly directed against Georgian government websites but also the web portals of Georgia’s National Bank and news agencies, partly resulting in shutting down the website servers for hours or days. Although suspicions of the – officially disclaimed – involvement of the Russian Federation in the cyber incidents remain, these incidences were allegedly attributed to the criminal organization “Russian Business Network” (hosting and renting illegal web services).\nIn regard to the aforementioned armed conflicts, it can be inferred that the conduct of CNO did partly influence the perception of the conflict in the public, but not its overall outcome. It can be assumed that also in the near future CNO are very likely to be used merely in support of a conventional military operation, mainly military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, or in order to influence the perception of a particular political conflict in the online media.\n## 2. Identification of the Origin and Attribution of Malicious CNO\nIt will always be difficult to unequivocally identify the computer systems that malicious CNO originated from and to attribute the attack to a certain entity, group or a State.\nA cyber attack is distinguished by its rapidness. As soon as the attack is completed, the tracing of the data stream (so-called back-tracing) and\nnews.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/352059.stm; ‘CIA Ordered to Topple Milosevic’, BBC News online of 6 July 1999, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/387463. stm; and F. Rötzer, ‘CIA im Crackerkrieg gegen Milosevich?’, heise online of 24 May 1999, available at http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/2/2874/1.html.\n Id.\n See Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, Report (September 2009), Vol. II., pp. 217 et seq., available at http://www.ceig.ch/pdf/IIFFMCG_Volume_II.pdf; and J. Markoff, ‘Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks’, The New York Times online of 13 August 2008, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=2&amp;em.\n For more details, see id.\n Id.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nthus the identification of the originating computer system are highly improbable. It is highly unlikely that hackers will leave any tangible evidence, for example in the protocols of the intrusion detection systems of the attacked network, as such evidence in these protocols is easy to delete once the network is penetrated.\nMoreover, and further aggravating the issue, a cyber-attack can be conducted “anonymously”, for example by using one of the (often) free of charge anonymisation services offered on the Internet which would hide the unique characteristics of the hackers’ computer system. These unique characteristics are the so-called IP address as well as other technical data a computer sends while connected to the Internet.\n An IP address (Internet Protocol number) is a twelve digit number, which identifies a computer or another network device during an Internet session. An IP data package is the basic element of data transmission via the Internet. It comprises: a header (containing information on the source, destination, status and fragmentation of the transmitted data) and a payload (containing the transmitted data). At the very beginning of the Internet, the IANA (see supra note 1) assigned static IP addresses, i.e. IP addresses permanently assigned to a particular user, to companies, organizations, universities and also to individuals. The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only. After the particular Internet session the dynamic IP address is assigned to another user and client of the respective Access Provider. At present, the so-called static IP-addresses are only being used for leased Internet-lines of major corporations and other entities.\n These include: Media Access Control address (MAC address) or – for the operating system Apple – the Airport ID of a computer (order of numbers, which clearly identifies a computer hardware); Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, details on the assignment of a MAC address or Airport ID to an IP address); Service Set Identity (SSID, details on the network name); Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol (WEP, coded details about the network); as well as details on the operating system and its adjustments. These details are – if not blocked – automatically transferred during the Internet session to any computer requesting this information by a so-called PING (Packet InterNet Grouper). A PING is computer software sending an ICMP-Echo-Request data package to the destination address of the host which is to be scanned, i.e. to the IP address, to the Domain Name System name (DNS name) or to the Network Basic Input Output System name (NetBIOS name) of the targeted host. The targeted system automatically responds by an ICMP-Echo-Reply, if – according to the usual adjustments of the system – the system supports the ICMP package.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nFurthermore, the Internet offers possibilities for deception in regard to the identity of the hackers' computer systems. It is perfectly possible to feign someone else's IP address and other technical data (so-called malicious misrepresentation or spoofing) and thus to operate in the Internet under someone else's \"cyber-identity\". The connection to the Internet can also be established via a mobile phone or other device with a feigned identity number. Additionally, the data stream can be conducted through the whole globe via a chain of computers of numerous unsuspecting individuals, if so-called zombie software (partly offered free of charge on the Internet) has been secretly installed on the respective computers by using Trojans. One of these computers could subsequently be misused as the sender of the data stream (so-called remote control). Thus, in the case of a cyber attack, even after a back tracing of the malicious data stream, the victim can seldom be sure as of the identification and geographical location of the computer system the attack originated from.\nAbove all, even if a malicious data stream of a cyber attack would indeed be successfully back-traced to the hackers' computer systems, it will – highly probable – remain unproven which individuals of which citizenship and on who's orders were operating the systems identified. Therefore, the attribution of a cyber attack to a certain individual, group, entity or State will most probably be based on unproven suspicions or indications only.\nConsequently, it will be very unlikely to recognize at first sight – and probably even after detailed technical analysis – whether the attack was conducted by a mischievous teenager, by a criminal (including a terrorist), by a group with extremist or terrorist background or by the adversary Party in an armed conflict.\nThese uncertainties will surely add to the complexity of both the legal analysis of a cyber attack and the victim's decision on choosing a subsequent course of action. Considering the difficulty in identifying and locating the hackers' computer systems and – most importantly – attributing the attack, in most cases it will remain in doubt whether national police forces and public prosecutors or, in the framework of international judicial cooperation, the police forces and public prosecutors of a foreign State, or the armed forces (in the case the attack occurs during an already existing armed conflict and is believed to have originated with a party to the armed conflict, or in the case the effects of the cyber-attack are comparable to a conventional armed\n\nattack and trigger the right to self-defence) retain main responsibility to deal with the case.\n## 3. CNO in Modern Warfare\nThe significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations is manifold.\nWhilst most armed conflicts in this day and age are occurring in regions that are technologically less sophisticated (e.g. Afghanistan, Sudan or Chad), this does not result in the irrelevance of the Internet and of CNO. It must be taken into consideration that, in regard to communication abilities and collection of open source information, the parties to armed conflicts in less well developed regions are also essentially dependent on – aside from radio traffic – wireless Internet connectivity, as other communication and information systems (e.g. telecommunication media, print media, telephone lines) are often non-existent.\nIt is especially evident in the context of so-called asymmetric warfare and in the hands of non-state actors, for instance terrorists, that CNO can be a powerful weapon, primarily against post-industrial States and their potent armed forces. More than ever, post-industrial States have technologically highly developed armed forces at their disposal, which correspondingly react most sensitively to technical disorder. It is the dependence on the technology which makes them extremely vulnerable to a cyber attack.\nAs CNO can be conducted from any place in the world by as little as a few experts and, in addition, are extraordinarily inexpensive when compared with conventional military operations, they offer a particularly practical and extremely powerful \"weapon\". Therefore, all aspects of CNO (see supra II.1) show an increasing significance in the context of national as well as of international security.\nAs the Head of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Co-ordination Centre stated already in 2008: \"Cyber war can become a very effective global problem because it is low-risk, low-cost, highly effective and easily globally deployable. It is almost an ideal weapon that nobody can ignore\".60\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## III. Legal Analysis of CNO\nAlthough some scholars plead for a general prohibition of CNO, currently such a ban does not exist. However, many international and domestic legal restrictions do apply to CNO – a fact which makes a legal analysis a complex undertaking.\nApart from the fundamental principle of public international law, namely the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations, a number of specific areas of public international law may apply to CNO. As data packages pass through the territory of several States when sent via the Internet, the provisions of territorial sovereignty must be considered. Also, data manipulations might – under certain circumstances – be judged as intervention in domestic affairs of a State, which would be considered illegal under public international law. Further, because satellite technology is involved, space law and especially treaties relating to satellites must be considered. As CNO can interfere with telecommunication systems and always result in data amendments in the working storage of the attacked computer system, both international telecommunications law and international copyright law (in regard to software) require a thorough analysis. In case human rights treaty law is generally applicable, their respective provisions must be considered, especially in regard to secrecy of correspondence, telecommunications and data protection, as well as to the right to receive and impart information and ideas. Restraints for CNO can further result from the provisions of diplomatic and consular law, whenever diplomatic or consular computer systems are involved. Furthermore, it has been asserted that international environmental law principles of good neighbourhood and of the prevention of significant trans-boundary harm would be applicable to CNO in analogy. In addition, the provisions of\n A. D’Amato pleads for a general prohibition of CNO, emphasizing that the stability of the international community depends on the free flow of information (p. 68) and that every nation has a vital interest in the operationability of the Internet (p. 69), see A. D’Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’, in M.N. Schmitt &amp; B.T. O’Donnell (eds.), *Computer Network Attack and International Law* (Newport / Rhode Island, US Naval War College, 2002), pp. 59–71, pp. 67–69. See also: T. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position. Viewing Information Warfare as Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’, Vol. 30 *Case Western Reserve* J.I.L. 1998, p. 600.\n Such assertion is made – emphasizing that the Internet is a global resource comparable to the natural environment – by T. Stein &amp; T. Marauhn, ‘Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen’, Vol. 60 *Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht* 2000, p. 21. A similar approach\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nrespective national law systems, especially constitutional and criminal law, must always be taken into consideration.\nGiven the variety of areas of law involved and the limited scope of this survey, the following remarks will be restricted to the analysis of LOAC, focusing on the provisions of the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Annex to the Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (HR), the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GC) $^{63}$ and their Additional Protocols I $^{64}$ (AP I) and II $^{65}$ (AP II) (2). However, first of all, it must be examined under which conditions LOAC applies to CNO (1).\n## 1. The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict\nAccording to common Article 2 of the GCs, LOAC applies to\nall cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.\nIn practice, armed conflicts surely can be considered as the main case of application of LOAC. Pursuant to the prevailing opinion an\nis taken by the (non-binding) OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems of 1992, which call for cooperation of States (Principle 6) in the area of comprehensive protection of information systems (Principle 4), and which stipulate an imperative of deliberation in the use of information systems (Principle 3), see OECD Doc. OCDE/GD(92)190. However, an analogous application of international environmental law provisions is not convincing because of the lack of an “unintended omission” or of the absence of regulation. International telecommunication law, in particular the provisions of the (almost universally ratified) Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) of 22 December 1992, binds ITU Member States to far-reaching obligations in regard to the protection of communication and information systems (see in particular Articles 6, 33, 38, 45 and 47 of the ITU Constitution).\n$^{63}$ These are: Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949; Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949; Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\n$^{64}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\n$^{65}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\ninternational armed conflict occurs when one or more States have recourse to “armed force” against another State, regardless of the legality, reasons or the intensity of this confrontation. This opinion is confirmed by the Commentary on the GC which states that “any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2”. Art. 1(4) AP I extends the definition of international armed conflict to include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination. A non-international armed conflict within the meaning of the common Article 3 GCs occurs when one or more non-governmental organized armed groups are involved and the situation reaches a certain threshold of confrontation, distinguishing it from internal disturbances, riots or acts of banditry (see also Art. 1 AP II). Thus, a situation of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and consequently the application of LOAC is given, when States or – under certain circumstances – organized armed groups use “armed force” against the other Party.\nUnsurprisingly, LOAC is applicable to all CNO conducted either in support of conventional military operations carried out in the event of an already ongoing armed conflict or conducted as the first step preparing the immediate start of conventional military operations altogether comprising an armed conflict.\nWhether “cyber war”, i.e. military operations conducted exclusively by the means of the Internet or other computer networks without the employment of other weaponry (in the following referred to as: “isolated” CNO), will ever per se be classified as “use of armed force” and thus comprise an armed conflict, depends on future State practice. As there is an absence of detailed academic work on this particular\n See D. Fleck (ed.), *The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law* (Oxford / New York, Oxford University Press, 2008, 2nd ed.), §§ 202 and 210; see also a compendium of scholar opinions in: International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), *How is the Term “Armed Conflict” Defined in International Humanitarian Law?*, Opinion Paper (March 2008), p. 1 et seq., available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf.\n J.

J.P. Terry describes cyberwar as a “lesser form of international conflict”, see J.P. Terry, ‘Responding to Attacks on Critical Computer Infrastructure. What\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nquestion, the following remarks will show criteria useful for the assessment whether particular types of “isolated” CNO constitute an armed conflict (A.). Furthermore, it will be analysed how the ius in bello terms “attack”, “act of violence” and “hostilities” apply to CNO (B.).\n## A. “Isolated” CNO as Armed Conflict\nAs stated above, an (international or non-international) armed conflict occurs when States or – under certain circumstances – (a State and/or) organized armed group(s) use “armed force” against each other.\nOf course, the notion of “use of armed force” – indicating that differences and confrontations did indeed reach the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and thus trigger the applicability of the ius in bello – is to be distinguished from the term “use of (armed)” force pursuant to Article 2(4) UN Charter, although the two terms are closely related. Whenever a State conducts actions considered as a “use of armed force” in the meaning of ius ad bellum against another State, this indicates the outbreak of hostilities reaching the level of “use of force” in the meaning of ius in bello and thus the threshold of an armed conflict triggering the applicability of LOAC – with the possible exception of quick, discrete and “surgical” use of force in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter without further retort by the victim (as e.g. the bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osirak/Iraq by Israeli Air Force in 1981).\nIn the following, criteria for the assessment whether a particular type of “isolated” CNO constitutes an armed conflict will be developed. The question whether a certain type of CNO can be deemed as “use of armed\nTargets? What Rules of Engagement?”, in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 434; see also the remarks by L. Doswald-Beck, 'Some Thoughts on Computer Network Attack and the International Law of Armed Conflict', in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 165.\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nforce” (in the *ius in bello* meaning) will be examined (while – apart from the above stated exception – exactly the same criteria can indicate whether “use of force” in the meaning of the *ius ad bellum* is given). However, most academic writings on CNO do refer to “use of armed force” in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter. References to such writings will be made when useful and appropriate in the discussion of the term “use of armed force” in the *ius in bello* meaning.\nAccording to the traditional understanding, the assumption is that the “use of armed force” requires the employment of kinetic weaponry; that is the employment of a tool designed to cause kinetic effects of physical nature on a body or on an object. CNO are usually neither designed nor intended to directly cause kinetic effects. The transfer of data and its delay or interruption, as well as the manipulation, suppression or deletion of data cannot be deemed to cause kinetic effects in the common meaning of the term. Therefore, a significant qualitative difference between CNO and conventional weapons can be identified. In contrast, some similarities between CNO and biological or chemical weapons (hereinafter referred to as BC weapons) can be conceived. The use of BC weapons does not cause destruction in conventional sense, because these weapons do not set free any kinetic energy.72 The employment of BC weapons is considered as a form of “use of armed force” because, although not resulting in physical destruction of material, these weapons are employed in order to cause death or injury to living things.73 Thus, in the case of BC weapons, the term “weapon” is defined with reference to their effects rather than their method, which perfectly corresponds with the effects-based approach inherent to public international law. Consequently, the majority of scholars rightly insist on an effects-based interpretation of the term of “use of armed force” in the context of CNO.74\nTherefore, in the following, different categories of potential effects which can be caused by CNO will be illustrated in order to determine when CNO must be deemed as “use of armed force”.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\ni. Death, Physical Injury and/or Destruction of Property\nAccording to the nearly uniform opinion among scholars (to which the author of the present survey subscribes), a CNO – similarly to the effects caused by BC weapons – should be considered as “use of armed force” if it results in death, physical injury or the destruction of property.75 As illustrated above (II.1.C), CNO can indirectly76 cause such effects.\nAccording to a minority view amongst scholars, a CNO, even if it indirectly causes death, physical injury or the destruction of property, qualifies as “use of armed force” only if at the same time it amounts to a “use of structural force”.77 “Structural force” is described in the public international law literature as a physical incursion into a State’s\n\nM.N. Schmitt proposes a catalogue of criteria indicating that CNO constitute “use of force”:\n- severity of the effects, i.e. threat of physical injury or destruction of property,\n- immediacy of the occurrence of the negative consequences,\n- direct nexus between the CNO and the negative consequences caused,\n- invasiveness of the consequences on foreign territory,\n- measurability of the consequences,\n- pre-assumption of illegitimacy of the CNO according to national rules and to the International Public Law, based on the prima facie illegitimacy of the use of force in international relations (the author of the present survey only guesses that the term “illegitimacy” indeed stands for “illegality”).\nSee Schmitt, supra note 28, pp. 65 et seq. This approach is not convincing because of the circular reasoning it contains. It cannot be decided whether a particular act is indeed illegal, by the simultaneous assertion of the illegality of the same act.\n\nterritory without the employment of conventional or mass destruction weapons, leaving the attacked State the “use of armed force” as the only option open for effective self-defence (e.g. in the case of intentional spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing widespread flooding).78 Thus, “structural force” is deemed as “use of armed force” in the sense of Article 2 (4) UN Charter if it has the same effect as an “armed attack” triggering the right to self-defence pursuant to Article 51 UN Charter.79 However, it must be considered that there is a significant qualitative difference between “use of armed force” and an “armed attack”. According to the prevailing opinion among public international law scholars and the settled jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, an “armed attack” only occurs when the “use of armed force” reaches a certain level of intensity in regard to its effects and scale.80 When this threshold of intensity is not reached, the respective actions in question can still be considered as “use of armed force”, although they do not constitute an “armed attack”.81 Therefore, the above presented view asserting that CNO can only be deemed as “use of force” when it comprises “structural force”, and thus setting the terms of “use of armed force” and “armed attack” equal, is highly questionable.\nFurthermore, some scholars demand additional criteria to be met in order to classify CNO as “use of armed force”. This is the direct nexus between the CNO and physical damage, the immediacy of the occurrence of the physical damage (in the sense that the occurrence of the damage does not depend on any additional factors) as well as whether the damage can be foreseen at all.82 However, these criteria determine the conditions of attribution of the damage to a certain action, and are therefore not relevant for the specification of the term “use of armed force”.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n## ii. Destruction of Data\nSome academic writings assert that the destruction of data of substantial importance and/or of significant economical value should be considered as “use of armed force”.83 But, in consequence, it would need to have been ascertained in every particular case whether indeed data of some economic value has been destroyed or whether the CNO is to be considered as trivial because the compromised or deleted data is of little or no value. In addition, it must be considered that in the case of a so-called DoS attack84 data will not be destroyed but rather its use and information value will be diminished by delay of its transmission or by temporary denial of access to the data. Furthermore, the effect of CNO directed against data only is not comparable to the effects of conventional weapons, for example a bombardment, or of BC weapons. Therefore, the above presented view is not convincing, as it is of little practical value and could lead to unbearable results.\nOther scholars assert that at least the destruction of data symbolizing an asset (e.g. data of an electronically operated banking account) should be considered as “use of armed force”.85 They suggest that this assessment would reflect the obligation to protect civilian objects from dangers arising from military operations.86 However, electronic assets, accounts, demands or claims cannot be equated with objects or physical property and their destruction cannot be compared with the destructive effects on physical property caused by conventional (or BC) weapons. Therefore, the opinion presented above does not capture accurately the translation of the traditional understanding of the term “use of armed force” into the “cyberspace”.\nIf, however, a CNO was to be directed against the whole economic or banking system as one of the critical infrastructures of a State, the situation must be judged differently (see III.1.A.v. on critical infrastructure systems).\n## iii. “Theft” of Data\nMoreover, it is asserted that the “theft” of particular data should be considered as “use of armed force”, if information of vital interest to\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\na State, for instance classified information, is compromised. Also the “theft” of all data of military nature (regardless of the classification) should be considered as “use of armed force”. However, the “theft” of data (CNE) merely represents a kind of modern espionage which is not generally forbidden under public international law. All in all, “theft” of data – even classified data of importance to the military – cannot be deemed as having similar effects as conventional or BC weapons and therefore cannot be judged as “use of armed force”. Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict.\niv. Massive Disruption of Military C3-Systems\nAdditionally, some scholars assert that the destruction or medium to long-term disruption of military command, control and communication systems (C3-systems) is to be deemed as “use of armed force”. Indeed, the intended outcome, namely the disruption of military communications and the consequent restraining ability on military command and control, can be achieved both through the physical destruction of respective systems by conventional weapons and through the massive disruption of the systems by malicious CNO. As such, the effect of a corresponding CNO is quite comparable to the effects of the employment of conventional weapons. This view is supported by Article VI of the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities concluded between the USA and the Soviet Union on 12 June 1989. According to this provision, the disruption of command and control systems (C2), resulting even in a mere restraint of those systems, would be regarded as a dangerous military activity. Given the political context of the agreement the provision indicates that a – massive – disruption of\n Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846, 855; contra: Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 10.\n Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846 and 856.\n D’Amato, supra note 61, p. 67; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 32 with further references. In regard to CNO as a modern form of espionage see: von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 134. Apart from the penalisation of espionage resulting from respective national law systems, spying is restrained by certain provisions of public international law, e.g. the taboos stated by the diplomatic and consular law protecting diplomatic and consular archives and correspondence, i.e. respective electronic databases and communication via the Internet.\n See M. Bothe, ‘Völkerrechtliche Verhinderung von Gewalt (ius contra bellum)’, in W. Graf Vitzthum, Völkerrecht (Berlin, De Gruyter, 2001), Section 8, § 10.\n Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8. See also Sharp, supra note 75, p. 129, who recognizes the right to self-defence against an attack on computer networks of “vital interest” to a State.\n Vol. 28 I.L.M. 1989, pp. 877 et seq.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nmilitary C3-systems could indeed be seen by States as “use of force”.\n## v. Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems\nThere is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]” This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.\nHowever, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment. This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems. It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing\n See supra section II.1.C.\n Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599. See also Sharp, supra note 75, pp. 129 et seq. Contra: Dinstein, supra note 75, p. 105; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8, who demand the occurrence of physical damage outside the targeted computer networks in order to qualify CNO as use of force.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nsimilar effects on critical infrastructure systems would be considered as “use of armed force”.\nvi. Intermediate Result\nAll in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities”\nAs far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\n2. Restraints for Malicious CNO Resulting from LOAC Provisions\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of\n\nwhich is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).\n## A. Prohibited Methods and Means of Warfare\n### i. Perfidy\nArticle 23(f) HR in conjunction with Articles 38 and 39 AP I as well as Article 12 AP II prohibit the misuse of distinctive emblems, signs, signals or flags of protected entities, including those of the Red Cross and its associated entities and of the United Nations. Furthermore, the provisions ban the misuse of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Party to the particular armed conflict as well as of the adversary Party (though, in regard to the latter only while engaging in attack or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations). Moreover, Article 44(3) AP I states the obligation for all members of the armed forces to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.\nAlthough the above-mentioned provisions refer to physically visible symbols carried by individuals or objects, the rules can also be observed in the \"cyberspace\". The spirit and purpose of these provisions is to preserve the neutrality of certain entities and to protect certain groups against dangers arising from military operations. Therefore, Parties to an armed conflict must not misuse the identity of these entities or groups. Consequently, the \"cyber identity\" (i.e. website, e-mail address, email header, IP address and other technical data sent while connected to the Internet) of one of the protected organisations or groups must not be used at any time during the conduct of CNO. A simple example of the ban would be that the header of an e-mail sent to adversary armed forces, containing a virus, indirectly causing physical damage outside the targeted network, must not show, for instance, the Red Cross as the\n Also see the Annex I to the AP I.\n Exceptions to those rules are stated in Article 39(3) AP I in regard to espionage and to the conduct of armed conflict at sea.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nsender. Also, while hacking adversary computer networks, the CNO forces must not feign technical data, which would lead to presumption of the “cyber identity” of a civilian if the concrete CNO conducted is to be considered as an “attack” or an “act preparatory to an attack” in the meaning of Article 44(3) AP I. Moreover, any respective manipulation of websites belonging to the protected entities would be illegal.\nIn addition, the prohibition of Article 23(b) HR in conjunction with Article 37(1) AP I, to kill, injure or capture an adversary under recourse to perfidy, applies to CNO. In general terms, perfidy describes an act which leads the adversary to erroneously believe that he or she is entitled to, or is obliged to accord protection under LOAC (see the definition of perfidy in Article 37(1) AP I). The ban covers, inter alia, intentional dissemination of misinformation to the adversary Party about the intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender, or about an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, as well as feigning civilian, non-combatant or protected status (e.g. of a United Nations employee or of a member of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, by using respective emblems, signs, signals or uniforms, see Art. 23(f) HR and Art. 37(1) AP I). The aforementioned misinformation can generally be transmitted by the means of the Internet, for example by e-mail or as a statement on a website. As already stated (e.g. supra II.2.), the “cyber-identity” of the aforementioned protected persons can easily be feigned in the “cyberspace”. However, the above described dissemination of misinformation or feigning of the (cyber) identity of a protected person is prohibited only if it directly results in the death, injury or capture of the adversary.\nConversely, legal ruses of war in the sense of Article 24 HR and Article 37(2) AP I, which are merely aimed to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly, offer a broad field of application to CNO. Thus, it is imaginable that a Party to an armed conflict establishes a so-called honey net around its own computer network, i.e. an outside-network building a buffer around its own computer network, which is only minimally protected against hacking and, technically speaking,\n The specific nexus between the dissemination of misinformation or feigning of a protected status on the one hand and the death, injury or capture of the adversary on the other hand is required in order to establish accountability of armed forces, as – in the traditional understanding of warfare – all military actions always pursue death, injury or capture of the adversary, see M. Bothe, K.J. Partsch &amp; W.A. Solf, *New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts. Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949* (The Hague / Boston / London, Martinus Nijhoff, 1982), Art. 37 (1) AP I, no. 2.4, p. 204.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nappears perfectly realistic, but contains false information, for example on planned military operations or on the status of own forces and their location. Such a honey net could be established specifically in the hope that the adversary Party would compromise it and – in this way – obtain false information.\n## ii. Methods or Means of Warfare Prohibited Because of the Nature of Their Effects\nSome methods or means of warfare are prohibited because of the nature of their effects.\nAccording to Article 51(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. This ban refers to the dissemination of certain information to the civilian population. As this information could be easily transmitted by means of computer-based information systems, for example via e-mail or as information on a website, this prohibition must be considered during the planning and the conduct of CNO.\nFurthermore, Article 23(e) HR, Article 35(2) AP I, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980 and its Protocols as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 prohibit the employment of methods or means of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Equally, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57(2)(a)(iii) AP I stipulate that an attack which may be expected to cause loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. As it is perfectly possible that a cyber attack could indirectly cause physical damage (see supra II.1.C), it must be examined beforehand whether the anticipated (indirect) effect would be excessive in the sense of the above-mentioned provisions. In this regard, as the expected effects of concrete CNO\n Those are: Protocol on Non-Detectable Fragments (Protocol I) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III) of 1980, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV) of 1995, and Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V) of 2003.\n See E.T. Jensen, ‘Unexpected Consequences from Knock-Out Effects: A Different\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nare to be assessed, the practical criteria for the examination resemble to ones for the analysis of the effects caused by other (e.g. conventional) weapons.\nMoreover, according to Article 51(4) AP I indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Attacks are deemed to be indiscriminate, when they are not or cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or when their effects cannot be limited (see Art. 51(4)(a)-(c) AP I). It is perfectly possible that CNO equated to an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello) or an “act of violence” (see III.1.B.) could have indiscriminate effects, in the case of global, uncontrolled spreading of viruses, bugs and – in future – micro-mechanical organisms via the Internet. However, damaging software could be programmed in such a way so as to only target computer systems with specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. An uncontrolled spread of malware, as well as any cascade effects, could be easily prevented by appropriate programming.\nHowever, the vast majority of malicious CNO will not achieve the quality of a “method or means of combat, the effects of which are indiscriminate”. The inductive conclusion drawn from the examples given by Articles 51(4)(a) and (b) AP I shows that the provisions refer to methods or means of combat which result in physically “devastating” physical effects.\nFinally, Article 35(3) in connection with Article 55(1) AP I prohibits the employment of methods or means of warfare which may be expected to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. This provision covers only especially extensive, intensive and long-lasting environmental damage, which exceeds the scale of both the quality and quantity of “ordinary” environmental damage which is expected to occur in the course of combat.[108] Severe damage of the natural environment can always be caused when dangerous forces are set free, such as by radiation escaping from a nuclear power plant, the explosion of a chemical or pharmacy installation, or the breaking of a dam or dyke. As such effects could be caused indirectly by CNO\nStandard for Computer Network Operations?', Vol. 18 American University LL.Rev. 2003, pp. 1178 et seq.; and Schmitt, supra note 28, p. 82.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(see supra II.1.C), the prohibition of Article 35(3) AP I must be also considered for operations primarily conducted within “cyberspace”.\n## B. Prohibited Targets\nFurthermore, LOAC provisions granting protection for non-combatants and for civilian objects are of significance for CNO.\n### i. Civilians Population and Individual Civilians\nThe civilian population as a whole, as well as individual civilians (see Art. 50 AP I), are protected against “attacks”, “acts of violence” and “effects of hostilities”. Accordingly, CNO which are not deemed as being “use of force”, and thus not comprising an “attack” (in the meaning of *ius in bello*), “act of violence” or “effect of hostilities” (see supra III.1.B) would not be contrary to LOAC and – from the perspective of international humanitarian law – could legally be directed against civilians.\nConversely, CNO considered as being a “use of force” could only be directed against civilians launching malicious CNO against the armed forces constituting “direct participation in hostilities” within the meaning of Article 51(3) AP I and Article 13(3) AP II. In order to distinguish between private hacking as “direct participation in hostilities” and hacking as a mere criminal act, all circumstances of a specific case must be taken into consideration (see also supra II.2).\nFurthermore, according to Article 48 AP I, the Parties to an armed conflict must, at all times, distinguish between the civilian population\n See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52(1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Art. 13(2) AP II.\n See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n Concurring: Schmitt, supra note 106, p. 378.\n The examination of the different approaches to the question of the direct participation of civilians in hostilities, and especially of the temporal scope of the loss of protection otherwise granted by international humanitarian law, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further examination, the following literature may be recommended selectively: N. Melzer, *Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities* (Geneva, ICRC, May 2009), available at www.icrc.org; Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 51 AP I, no. 2.4.2.2., p. 303; M.N. Schmitt, ‘Direct Participation in Hostilities and 21st Century Armed Conflict’, in H. Fischer, U. Froissart, W.H. von Heinegg &amp; C. Raap (Hrsg.), *Krisensicherung und humanitärer Schutz – Crisis Management and Humanitarian Protection. Festschrift für Dieter Fleck* (Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), pp. 505–529.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nand combatants. Admittedly, the conventional (visual) criteria for the identification of a combatant as set out in Articles 43 and 44 AP I are not helpful for CNO, during which the acting individuals are not physically visible. However, the obligation to distinguish can also be met within “cyberspace”. In the “virtual world”, a computer of a combatant can be distinguished from the computer of a non-combatant according to its IP address and other technical data automatically sent during an Internet session. It can easily be verified by everybody in one of the official WhoIs? Internet databases to which person or entity a specific IP address or an IP address range is assigned. In addition, the “owner” and the responsible administrators of websites can be found in the WhoIs? databases. Thus, in principle it can be confirmed whether a particular actor in the “virtual world” should be considered as a member of the armed forces or as a civilian.\nNevertheless, some challenges as to the identification of a person acting in the “cyberspace” as a combatant will remain. For example, a member of regular armed forces and thus a combatant will not be recognizable as such when using his private computer at home, the latter sending during an Internet session information identifying the user as a civilian. This resembles the “real world” situation, when a soldier is not wearing the uniform when being at home and thus cannot visually be identified as a combatant as well. Thus, the remaining challenges are not new and will mostly resemble similar “real world” cases.\n## ii. Civilian Objects\nAccording to Article 48 AP I, civilian objects must be distinguished from military objectives. Civilian objects must not be the objects of attack or reprisals (Articles 48, 52(1)-(2) and 57 AP I, see also Art. 23(g) HR and further specific regulations in Articles 53–56 AP I and Articles 14–16 AP II). Generally, this principle of distinction, as well as the above-mentioned prohibitions, can also be observed within the “virtual world”.\n See the profound examination by S. Watts, ‘Combatant Status and Computer Network Attack’, Vol. 50 No. 2 Virginia J.I.L. 2010, pp. 391–447.\n The WhoIs? databases of the RIRs (see supra note 58) provide information on which IP address is assigned to which end customer (in the case of dynamic IP-addresses: to which Internet Service Provider). Thus, the database DENIC (available at http://www.denic.de) provides respective information on “.de” domains, and the database RIPE (available at http://www.ripe.net) on the other domains in Europe, InterNIC (available at http://www.internic.net/whois.html) on the domains “com”, “edu”, “int”, “net” or “org”. The database Network Information Center (available at http://www.nic.com) leads to official and regional WhoIs? databases as well as to respective private databases available online.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nViruses, bugs and – in the future – micro-mechanical organisms can be programmed in such a way that they only affect military computer networks, namely those with corresponding IP addresses or IP address ranges. The identification of a computer or computer system as military or civilian can be made by a search request of a specific IP address in one of the Whols? databases (see supra III.2.B.i).\nMalicious CNO against a purely military computer network, such as the Intranet or other communication systems of armed forces supported by the Intranet, would be perfectly legal in regard to LOAC. CNO launched against civilian computer networks – in case they are not to be considered as military objectives pursuant to Article 52(2) AP I – would only be allowed when they are not to be considered as an “attack” in the sense of Article 49(1) AP I, i.e. would not cause any physical damage (see supra III.1.B). A mere suppression or denial of access of the civilian population to a computer network or to specific data as well as the mere manipulation or the deletion of particular data would not fall under the prohibition of attack, as long as physical damage in- or outside the directly affected networks is not caused. For example, the deletion of a particular electronically operated bank account of a civilian would not be forbidden as a matter of LOAC.\nDistinction between civilian objects and military objectives becomes difficult when a computer network is used by both combatants and non-combatants (so-called dual use objects). This applies especially to the global Internet where, apart from the civilian population, there is a high probability that it will also be used by Parties to an armed conflict for the purposes of communication and information gathering. According to some scholars, the Internet is to be deemed as a military objective as soon as it is also used for military purposes.[116] Considering that nowadays the Internet is as an equally important means of communication as telephone and telegraph connections were in the past, the aforementioned opinion is supported by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had already in 1956 classified the latter as military objectives.[117]\n[116] This assertion is made in general terms, referring to communication networks used for both military and civilian purposes by Jensen, supra note 105, pp. 1160 et seq.; J.P. Terry, ‘The Lawfulness of Attacking Computer Networks in Armed Conflict and in Self-Defense in Period Short of Armed Conflict: What are the Targeting Constrains?’, Vol. 169 Mil. L. Rev. 2001, p. 85; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 35. Similarly: Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, no. 2.4.2., p. 324.\n[117] Annex Military Targets to the Draft Rules for the Limitation of Dangers Incurred\n\nHowever, some scholars refuse to classify civilian means of communication merely co-used for military purposes as a military objective. Indeed, in order to avoid any “automatism”, a thorough examination of the definition of a military objective provided by Article 52(2) AP I will be necessary. The definition clearly refers to objects only. Thus, at first sight, it seems doubtful whether the “virtual world” of the Internet can be deemed to be an object. However, the computer system Internet is not a purely intellectual construction. It comprises a multitude of objects, including technical equipment as servers, cables, cross points and access points; thus, the provision is in general applicable to the Internet. According to this definition, the computer system Internet or any other (dual use) computer network is to be considered as a military objective, if\n- the computer network makes an effective contribution to military action by its use, and\n- the total or partial destruction or neutralization of the computer network offered a definite (i.e. concrete and perceptible) military advantage (in regard to the overall military operation).\nWhether the Internet meets these conditions depends on the degree to which the other Party to the armed conflict uses the Internet, and whether this Party can easily revert to alternative communication means. Therefore, the characterisation of the Internet, or other dual use computer networks, as a military objective depends on the circumstances of the specific situation, especially on the degree of the dependence of the adversary Party on those networks, *ergo* on the level of the technologisation of the adversary armed forces.\nEven if the Internet was to be considered to be a military objective in the context of a particular armed conflict, it must be considered that it would be allowed to be attacked only as far as its physical elements\nby the Civilian Population in Time of War, see Fleck, supra note 66, § 443. von Heinegg, supra note 77, pp. 150 seq.\n The examination, whether the “contribution” shall have a particular significance for or shall merely support a certain military operation, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further details see Fleck, supra note 66, § 442; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.3., p. 324.\n See R. Wedgwood, ‘Proportionality, Cyberwar and the Law of War’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 225; and von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 150.\n Wedgwood, supra note 120, p. 225; Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 149; Fleck, supra note 66, § 444; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.4. See also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) of the ICC Statute.\n\n(e.g. server, cross points and WLAN access points) are located on the territory of one of the Parties to the particular armed conflict. But, even if such an attack was conducted successfully, a connection to the Internet could still be made from the same geographical area, for example via a mobile phone or other device enabled with respective software permitting Internet connectivity. Thus, an attack against the Internet intending the *quasi* disabling of a network within the area of conflict is unlikely to succeed.\n### iii. Objects under Special Protection\nAdditionally, LOAC provides special protection against attacks and reprisals for specific civilian objects. Corresponding prohibitions can be found in Article 27 HR, Articles 19-21 GC I., Articles 22 and 24 GC II., Articles 18 *et seq.* GC IV, Article 4 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954 and in its Protocol I of 1954 and Protocol II of 1999, Articles 12, 21, 24 *et seq.*, 54(2) and (4) and 56 AP I as well as in Articles 11 and 14–16 AP II. Pursuant to these provisions, special protection is provided for dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (*inter alia* drinking water installations and water irrigation works), medical units and transportation, historic monuments, works of art or places of worship etc. As far as incorporating computer-based elements, the above-mentioned objects could be disrupted or even destroyed by the means of a cyber attack. Therefore, the computer-based cooling system of a nuclear power plant, for example, must not be disabled by remote control, a drinking water installation must not be destroyed by a computer controlled opening and closing of its valves, a medical aircraft must not be caused to crash by manipulation of data of an air traffic control system, or a museum protected by *ius in bello* must not be flooded by the remote activation of a water sprinkler system.\n In general terms, a *Wireless Local Area Network* (WLAN) describes a local wireless and direct connection between two or more mobile end devices (*clients*), which are equipped with a wireless access device. Usually, *clients* access the Internet via a central bridge (so-called *access point*). The bridge has a *router*, which – based on a *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol* (DHPC server) – assigns a dynamic IP address to each *host* (see also *supra* note 58) seeking connectivity to the Internet.\n In order to disable the Internet, all its thirteen *root servers* (i.e. the main *domain name servers* or the main server layer of the internet) would have to be disconnected or destroyed. For security reasons, those servers are located in different, secret sites which are geographically distant. It is asserted that disabling up to ten of the *root servers* would probably merely delay the data transfer via the Internet.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nGenerally speaking, the aforementioned provisions, which provide special protection for specific civilian objects, can cease in the event that the objects are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy or for regular, significant and direct support for military operations of the enemy. In general terms, an active counter-CNO (back-hacking) could be legally launched once a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit to stop the forbidden activities, and after such warning has remained unheeded. For example, in the case of the computer network of a medical unit, if it had been identified as the location of origin of malicious CNO, as an exception, an active counter-CNO could be launched if a warning about the forthcoming back-hacking had been given in advance, for instance in the form of a pop-up window which would appear on the computer screen of the cyber attacker.\nIt should also be considered that as far as an attack against an object is forbidden, the enemy must not be led to attack such objects. Therefore, CNO which would correspondingly manipulate a targeting database of the adversary Party to the armed conflict in order to assign the data of the geographical coordinates of a civilian object under special protection to the data of a military objective of the adversary Party would be forbidden. As an example, when manipulating the adversary's targeting database, a munitions factory must not be assigned the geographical coordinates of a hospital.\n## 3. The Law of Neutrality and the Cyberspace\nFirst of all, neutrality in the sense of *ius in bellum* has to be distinguished from permanent neutrality (e.g. the cases of Austria, the Holy See, and Switzerland), i.e. the legal obligation undertaken in peacetime to remain neutral in cases of armed conflict or war between other States, and from the mere neutrality policy (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Ireland), which, nonetheless, can have some legally binding effects due to the situation of confidence created in which other States may rely on the (political) declarations to remain neutral (principle of estoppel).\n## A. The Applicability of the Law of Neutrality\nNeutrality is a particular status of a State not Party to an armed conflict of significant scope or – according to a traditional view – to a “war\n Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1105.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin the legal sense” between other States. Although it is not crucial for the purposes of the present survey to decide which view is to be followed, it may be mentioned that the International Court of Justice stated in its Advisory Opinion on the *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* of 8 July 1996 that “[...] the principle of neutrality [...] is applicable [...], to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used”. However, it must always be taken into consideration that in particular cases the rules governing neutrality may be modified by collective self-defence provisions such as Article 51 UN Charter and Article 5 North Atlantic Treaty (depriving a State of the possibility to legally join an armed conflict or a war on the side of the aggressor) and by (binding) decisions taken by the UN Security Council (see Articles 2(5) and 25 and Chapter VII UN Charter; the obligation to assist any action taken by the UN in accordance with the Charter would forestall a State to appeal to its neutrality).\nIn the following it will be shown that the rules on neutrality – which are over 100 years old – apply to military operations conducted in cyberspace (during an armed conflict of significant scope or a “war in the legal sense”). When examining the law of neutrality, no difference will be made between the specific rules applying to land, air or sea warfare, as the distinction between these areas is not relevant to CNO.\n## B. Prohibition of CNO Causing Physical Damage\nFirst and foremost, the rules of neutrality protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the neutral State, see Article 1 Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907 (HC V) and Art. 1 Hague Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 1907 (HC XIII).\nThus, the principle of neutrality prohibits causing physical damage on the sovereign territory of a neutral State. Consequently, a malicious\n The discussion of the question, whether rules on neutrality apply in situations of war (in legal sense) only or also in situations of an armed conflict of significant scope, would exceed the scope of the present survey. Interested readers may be referred to the assessment in Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1106.\n ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90 (emphasis by the author).\n See further details at Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1103; and G. Walker, ‘Information Warfare and Neutrality’, Vol. 33 *Vanderbilt J. Transnational L.* 2000, pp. 1079 et seq.\n ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90. Regarding the necessary criteria of a “physical encroachment”\n\nCNO would only breach the principle of the territorial inviolability of a neutral State if it – indirectly – caused physical damage (deaths, injuries or destruction of property) on the territory of a neutral State or medium to long-term disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a neutral State (see supra III.1.A.vi). In this regard, the physical damage could refer to physical components (technical equipment) of the Internet and/or other computer systems as well as to objects/living beings outside the affected computer systems.\nIn regard to critical infrastructure systems, it must always be considered that they can be shared by several States (e.g. an electricity distribution system is shared between Laos and Thailand, between Venezuela and Brazil, between Canada and the United States and between Indonesia and Singapore; one telecommunication system is shared by several States in East and South-East Asia).[129] Thus, before targeting a critical infrastructure system of the adversary it must always be examined (in addition to other LOAC provisions relevant to targeting) whether the estimated damage could also automatically affect another State neutral to the particular armed conflict or war.\n# C. The Use of Telecommunication Means Belonging to a Neutral State\nAccording to Article 8 HC V, a neutral State can allow the belligerents to use \"telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals\". The neutral State also has the right to restrict or prohibit the use of such communication means, if applied (by the State, companies or individuals) impartially to all belligerents (see Article 9 HC V and 9(1) HC XIII).\nIn regard to the Internet, such a restriction or prohibition could be enforced by a neutral State by applying certain software to all Internet cross points located on its territory. The software would scan the Internet traffic for data packages sent by the belligerents and delete them. Of course, a neutral State could also disable all technical components supporting the worldwide network Internet and located on its territory. This way, the belligerents would not use the Internet components located on the territory of the neutral State, although the Internet system as such would continue to function and could be further used by the Parties to the armed conflict or war.\nsee Greenberg, Goodman &amp; Soo Hoo, supra note 75, p. 10.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nIn the case one Party of the armed conflict or war used the computer network located on the territory of a neutral State to send malicious CNO to the computer systems of the other belligerent – either by launching malicious CNO from neutral State’s territory or by using Internet cross points or other technical equipment located on its territory –, the neutral State would have the right to “protect” its neutral status by taking appropriate actions (e.g. back-hacking). If it failed to do so, the neutral State would have – pursuant to the principle of non-discrimination of belligerents – the obligation to allow the affected belligerent to take action against the malicious CNO.^[130]^\n## D. Data Streams Passing the Territory of a Neutral State\nHowever, it is perfectly possible, even likely, that in the course of the conduct of CNO the data stream carrying malicious components (e.g. viruses or worms) to the adversary’s computer systems passes Internet crossing points and servers located on the territory of a neutral State. However, this would not result in violation of neutrality law.\nFirst of all, a Party to a conflict cannot influence whether a data stream crosses the technical components of the Internet situated on the territory of a neutral State or not. Every data stream sent via the Internet is divided in data packages, each one of which takes – out of millions possible routs – a certain route from cross point to cross point around the globe. The respective choices are done automatically by the Internet system (depending on the traffic load on the routes) and cannot be foreseen or influenced.^[131]^\nFurthermore, according to Article 3(a) HC V and Article 5 HC XIII, a Party to an armed conflict or war is only forbidden to “[e]rect on the territory [including territorial waters] of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea”, and pursuant to Article 3(b) HC V to “[u]se any installation of this kind established by them [i.e. belligerents] before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages”. This means that belligerents are allowed to use all non-purely military means of communication erected or established on the territory of a neutral State – by whomever – before the armed conflict or war. This would apply to all technical installations on the territory of\n^[130]^ Jensen, *supra* note 105, pp. 238 et seq.\n^[131]^ Walker, *supra* note 127, pp. 1079 et seq.\n\nthe neutral State being part of the worldwide, already existing computer network Internet, as it is – also historically – a communication means used by civilians also. It is asserted within academic writings that the establishment of a connection to the Internet as such should be deemed as similar to the forbidden “erecting” of a “communication apparatus”. However, it is more convincing to compare the establishment of a connection to the Internet to connecting to the worldwide telephone system by dialling a phone number – which would surely not be considered as forbidden “erecting” a “communication apparatus” by a belligerent.\nFinally, it must be endorsed that, because the law of neutrality does provide special provisions referring to communication systems on land or in territorial waters (Art. 3 HC V and Art. 5 HC XIII), there is no need or space for an (analogous) application of rules relating to the innocent passage through territorial waters, as asserted in some scholar writings.\n## IV. Concluding Remarks\nGiven the developments in technology and reliance on computer systems, in the future, CNO are likely to be of considerable significance for the planning and conduct of military operations. One of the reasons is that both the equipment and the conduct of CNO are extremely inexpensive when compared to conventional military operations. In addition, CNO can be conducted by only a few experts and from any location distant from the (traditional) area of combat, which safeguards the physical protection of the members of armed forces involved. Furthermore, as mentioned above, within the context of so-called asymmetric warfare, CNO can be a powerful weapon in the hands of non-state actors against the technologically highly developed armed forces of post-industrial States sensitive to malfunctions of their computer networks.\nOwing to the potential physical effects of CNO, the Parties to any future armed conflict in which CNO will be carried out, either in support of conventional military abilities or as the only method of war fighting conducted, will have to observe relevant LOAC provisions. The spirit and purpose of these protection granting rules, as well as the values they reflect, are timeless. They offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n *Id.*\n Such an assertion is made by Walker, *supra* note 127.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nNeither a lack of regulation nor a need for amendment of “aged” norms can be identified, when a teleological interpretation of the provisions is applied.\nThe future practice of the armed forces will show whether adjustments in the interpretation of relevant LOAC provisions will have to be made. The practice of the international community will decide, whether in the future it will be considered necessary to increase the level of the humanitarian protection during armed conflicts, and thus to include protection e.g. of data contained in computers or computer networks of non-combatants. Unquestionably, lawyers advising armed forces will have ever more to deal with corresponding questions of law and to understand the technical details of CNO as an emerging weapon, means or method of war.\n\n## Summary – Résumé – Samenvatting – Zusammenfassung – Riassunto – Resumen\n## Summary – Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nThe Internet has become the most essential means of communication and information. This results in a high dependency upon reliable operations of Internet based communication systems, especially those supporting critical infrastructure systems. Given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to security, the vulnerability of computer systems has become a significant matter of (national or collective) security to many States as well as to NATO. The potential conduct of “Computer Network Operations” (CNO), i.e. military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks, presents some legal challenges. This survey first examines the nature of CNO and discusses the difficulties of identification of the origin and of attribution of a malicious action carried out via or in the cyberspace to a certain actor. After the presentation of some criteria for the qualification of CNO as “use of armed force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning), the survey argues that the Laws of Armed Conflict, including the over hundred years old principles and provisions of neutrality, do apply to CNO. At the same time, it demonstrates that the provisions offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n## Résumé – Les Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques et le Droit des Confits Armés\nL’internet est devenu un moyen de communication et d’information indispensable. Il en résulte une grande dépendance envers la fiabilité du fonctionnement des systèmes de communication basé sur l’internet, particulièrement ceux au soutien d’infrastructures critiques. Étant donné les insuffisances de l’internet en matière de sécurité, la vulnérabilité des systèmes d’ordinateurs est devenue un sujet important pour la sécurité (nationale et collective) de plusieurs États ainsi que pour l’OTAN. La conduite éventuelle d’Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques (OCRI), à savoir des actions militaires offensives ou défensives prises grâce aux moyens mêmes de l’internet ou de réseaux d’ordinateurs, présente quelques défis juridiques. Cet article examine d’abord la nature des OCRI et discute des difficultés associées à l’identification de l’origine et de l’attribution à un acteur précis d’une action malicieuse\n\nexécutée à travers ou au sein du cyber espace. Après avoir présenté quelques critères pour qualifier les OCRI comme étant une utilisation de la force armée (au sens *ius in bello*) l'auteur soutient ensuite que le droit des conflits armés ainsi que les principes et dispositions plus que centenaire en matière de neutralité s'appliquent aux OCRI. Par la même occasion, l'article démontre que ces dispositions offrent un niveau de protection humanitaire qui est comparable à celui en vigueur pour l'utilisation des armes classiques.\n## Samenvatting – Computer netwerk operaties en het humanitair oorlogsrecht\nHet Internet is uitgegroeid tot het belangrijkste communicatie- en informatiemiddel. Dit heeft geleid tot een grote afhankelijkheid van op Internet gebaseerde communicatiesystemen, vooral van die systemen die kritische infrastructuur ondersteunen. Door de beperkingen van het Internet op het gebied van beveiliging, is de kwetsbaarheid van computersystemen een zaak van (nationale of collectieve) veiligheid geworden voor veel staten en voor de NAVO. Computer netwerk operaties (CNO), dat wil zeggen defensieve of offensieve militaire handelingen door middel van Internet of andere computernetwerken, roept juridische vragen op. Dit artikel onderzoekt eerst wat CNO is en bespreekt de moeilijkheden rond het identificeren van de bron van en toerekening aan een bepaalde actor van een vijandige handeling die in of via cyberspace wordt uitgevoerd. Nadat een aantal criteria voor de kwalificatie van CNO als geweldgebruik (in de zin van het *ius in bello*) zijn geponeerd, beargumenteert het artikel dat het humanitair oorlogsrecht, waaronder de principes en regels betreffende neutraliteit die meer dan honderd jaar oud zijn, zich lenen voor toepassing op CNO. Aangetoond wordt dat de bepalingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht binnen dit domein een niveau van bescherming bieden dat vergelijkbaar is met het niveau dat van toepassing is op het gebruik van conventionele wapens.\n## Zusammenfassung – Computernetwerkoperationen und das humanitäre Völkerrecht\nDas Internet wurde zu einem essentiellen Kommunikations- und Informationsmittel unserer Zeit.

Esto lleva consigo un alto grado de dependencia con respecto a los sistemas de comunicación centrados en la red, especialmente por lo que se refiere a los sistemas que sirven de apoyo a infraestructuras vitales. Vista la escasa seguridad de las comunicaciones a través de internet, la vulnerabilidad de los sistemas de información se ha convertido en una cuestión prioritaria para la seguridad (nacional y colectiva) de muchos Estados así como para la OTAN. Las conductas potenciales que pueden ser objeto de las operaciones a través de la red informática (Computer Network Operations – CNO), como por ejemplo acciones militares tanto ofensivas como defensivas llevadas a cabo a través de internet o de otras redes de información, presentan aspectos interesantes desde el punto de vista jurídico. El presente artículo examina en primer lugar la naturaleza de las CNO y analiza las dificultades que existen para identificar el sistema en el que tiene su origen un ataque y la posterior atribución de una conducta delictiva llevada a cabo en el espacio cibernético (o a través de este último) a un sujeto determinado. Tras la exposición de algunos criterios que permiten calificar las CNO como “uso de fuerza armada” (en el sentido del *ius in bello*), el artículo demuestra que el Derecho de los Conflictos Armados resulta de aplicación a las CNO, incluidos los principios y preceptos ultra-centenarios relativos a la neutralidad. Al mismo tiempo, pone de manifiesto cómo ese Derecho ofrece un nivel de protección humanitaria comparable con el que es de aplicación en el campo del uso de armas convencionales.",

Forms and Effects of CNO The concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA)."

      "## A. CND CND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) one’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone).¹⁶ The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies,¹⁷ merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA."

CNE According to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”.¹⁸ This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage."

      "## C. CNA CNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”.²⁴ These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware²⁵). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks."

Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict."

      "## v. Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems There is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems⁹³ by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]”⁹⁴ This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41."

Introduction In this day and age, the Internet¹ is one of the most important means of communication and information. During the last 30 years it has gradually become an essential aspect of the economy in a globalized world and plays an indispensable role in, amongst other things, the administrative and judicial systems of technologically developed countries. All in all, critical infrastructure systems in States with high levels of technology dependency are acutely reliant upon reliable and effective operations of Internet based communication systems. Thus, given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to the security, protection and defence of the integrity of computer networks, the vulnerability of these communication systems has become a significant matter of national security to many such States. Accordingly, the current National Security Strategies of the USA², of the United Kingdom³, ¹ The Internet is globally administered by a Californian (US) non-profit, public-benefit corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which, in the framework of a Public Private Partnership, is associated with and reports to the US Department of Commerce (although, according to the information on ICANN’s website, the organisation heavily emphasises its international nature and independence). ICANN bears global responsibility for ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet as well as for coordinating the Internet system of unique identifiers, i.e. for the assignment of IP-address ranges (since 2005 not directly to users but to regional organisations – see infra note 58). It is further responsible for the generic codes and country codes of the Internet top level domain as well as for the management and maintenance of the (secret) Internet root server system (see infra note 122). ICANN is the successor organization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which was executing the above-mentioned tasks directly on behalf of the US Department of Commerce (information available at http://www.icann/org/en/factsheets/factsheet.html; unless indicated otherwise, all URLs cited in the present survey were last visited on 31 November 2010). Originally, it was planned to transform ICANN into an independent organization in October 2006. During the 2nd World Summit on the Information Society, organized by the UN in Tunis in November 2005, it was proposed to submit ICANN (and thus the Internet itself) to management by the UN. The USA rejected this proposal and declared its intent to keep the control over ICANN for the time being (information available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/).\n² The President of the United States of America, National Security Strategy (May 2010), p. 27 et seq., available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf.\n³ Her Majesty’s Government, A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The National Security Strategy (October 2010), pp. 11 and 27, available at http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191639.pdf?CID=PDF&amp;PLA=furl&amp;CRE=nationalsecuritystrategy.\nand Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defence White Paper,⁴ all seek to address the issue of cyber-attacks. According to NATO’s new Strategic Concept of 19 November 2010, cyber threats are one of the major perils for the security of the Alliance in the future decade.⁵ Similar concerns are reflected in resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly over the last ten years, which regularly mention the integrity of information and communication technology in the context of international security and call for the creation of a global “culture of cyber security”.⁶ Additionally, the emerging threat of the use of ⁴ Federal Ministry of Defence, White Paper 2006 on German Security Policy and the Future of the Bundeswehr (2006), p. 17: “Germany’s political and economic structures as well as its critical infrastructure have become more vulnerable as a result, not least where criminal activities, terrorist acts, or military attacks from or on cyberspace are concerned”; available at http://www.bmvg.de/fileserving/PortalFiles/C1256EF40036B05B/W26UWAMT995INFODE/W%202006%20eng%20DS.pdf.\n⁵ NATO, Strategic Concept For the Defence and Security of The Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Adopted by Heads of State and Government in Lisbon (19 November 2010), §§ 12 and 19, available at http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf. See also NATO, Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon, Lisbon Summit Declaration (20 November 2010), § 40: “Cyber threats are rapidly increasing and evolving in sophistication. In order to ensure NATO’s permanent and unfettered access to cyberspace and integrity of its critical systems, we will take into account the cyber dimension of modern conflicts in NATO’s doctrine and improve its capabilities to detect, assess, prevent, defend and recover in case of a cyber attack against systems of critical importance to the Alliance. We will strive in particular to accelerate NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) to Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2012 and the bringing of all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection. We will use NATO’s defence planning processes in order to promote the development of Allies’ cyber defence capabilities, to assist individual Allies upon request, and to optimize information sharing, collaboration and interoperability. To address the security risks emanating from cyberspace, we will work closely with other actors, such as the UN and the EU, as agreed. We have tasked the Council to develop, drawing notably on existing international structures and on the basis of a review of our current policy, a NATO in-depth cyber defence policy by June 2011 and to prepare an action plan for its implementation”; available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_68828.htm.\n⁶ See the resolutions Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, UN Documents A/53/70 of 4 December 1998, A/54/49 of 1 December 1999, A/55/28 of 20 November 2000, A/56/19 of 29 November 2001, A/57/53 of 22 November 2002, A/58/32 of 8 December 2003, A/59/61 of 3 December 2004, A/60/45 of 8 December 2005, A/61/55 of 6 December 2006, and A/62/17 of 5 December 2007.

Additionally, the Internet offers the possibility for offensive and/or defensive military actions by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. The military term “Computer Network Operations” (CNO) refers, generally speaking, to computer hacking and back-hacking in the context of a military operation.\nWorldwide, military forces are preparing for the fight in cyberspace. It has been alleged that Israeli armed forces have engaged in CNO activities since the early 1990s.8 The USA established a US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in Fort Meade, Maryland on 23 June 2009 (operational as of October 2010) which unified the already existing cyber capabilities of the US National Security Agency and several US military services (Army Forces Cyber Command, 24th US Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command).9 According to media reports, Belgium10, Germany11, South Korea12 (allegedly in reaction to respective North Korean endeavours), and the UN Documents A/55/63 of 4 December 2000, A/56/121 of 19 December 2001, A/57/239 of 20 December 2002, and A/58/199 of 23 December 2003.\nUnited Kingdom (Government Communications Headquarters)¹³ have established similar commands in 2009, while China¹⁴ did so in 2010.¹⁵ Undeniably, CNO have become an important weapon, means or method of warfare extending the – traditionally clearly defined – battlefield to the global cyberspace. Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n¹³ See C.

The Nature and Significance of CNO In the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).",
    "## 1. Forms and Effects of CNO The concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA).": "The above-mentioned components of CNO are strongly interrelated. An adversary’s CNA can help one’s own CND when analysed appropriately. A CNE cannot be conducted without CNA, as the information to be gathered by CNE will mostly be protected by firewalls, passwords and other barriers that are erected to prevent an adversarial CNA. Finally, CNA cannot be conducted without CNE, as without information gathering on the targeted network’s architecture and systems the CNA would effectively be conducted blindly.\nWhile the practical value of the taxonomy of CND/CNE/CNA therefore is questionable, it will be presented in more detail below as most academic writings and media reports refer to this classification.",
    "## A. CND CND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) one’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone).¹⁶ The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies,¹⁷ merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA.": "",
    "## B. CNE According to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”.¹⁸ This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage.": "According to open source reports, the vast majority of CNO activities conducted during peacetime consist of CNE. For example, already in 2007, the British intelligence service MI5 warned all financial service providers and companies in Great Britain against concerted cyber espionage endeavours by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.¹⁹ In summer 2007, the computer systems of Germany’s Federal Chancellery as well as those of some federal ministries were infected with spyware (i.e. espionage software) reported to have originated from China.²⁰ According to the Annual Report 2009 of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, computer systems of Germany’s federal and state governments and of private businesses were targeted by hundreds of (successful and/or unsuccessful) CNE. Foreign intelligence MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) services were likely to be the organizers of, or are involved in, most of these.²¹ In the USA, over 100 foreign intelligence services currently endeavour to intrude computer systems located in the country, as the US Deputy Secretary of Defence stated in September 2010.²² NATO’s computer networks are also subject to constant – and partly successful – CNE.²³ There is no open source information as to the employment of CNE during an armed conflict. However, it can be assumed that CNE is very likely to be used in support of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance.",
    "## C. CNA CNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”.²⁴ These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware²⁵). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks.": "Relatively harmless, data modification in the course of a CNA can modify and deface a website (defacement). This is often conducted by hackers who wish to express their political view (hacktivism). Another widely spread form of CNA is the Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) (DDoS-attack),²⁶ which can cause delays in the data transfer process, the denial of access to computer systems or servers (e.g. the targeted websites or a email service) or result in the (only temporary) disabling of the targeted systems. The particular DDoS-techniques are as diverse as the – partly very effective – countermeasures²⁷ developed since 2000.\nHowever, the deletion or modification of data in a successfully intruded computer network can be more hazardous. Hackers can generate wrong information, for instance in the military environment the content of electronically transmitted orders, plans and maps or the localization data of military targets contained in a targeting-database.\nMoreover, it is possible that a CNA could – indirectly – cause death, physical injury or physical destruction of property. As far as chemical plants, nuclear power stations, oil refinery installations, gas store installations or electrical power distribution installations have or rely on computer-based control systems, these systems could be penetrated and manipulated. Thus, a CNA could cause the explosion of a nuclear power plant if the cooling systems were disabled via remote control. The same applies to computer-based control systems of transportation systems. By manipulation of the rail points, train derailments or collisions could be caused; penetration and minimal amendments to the programming of an air traffic control system could result in aircraft incidents. Therefore, the classification of CNO as a non-lethal weapon, as asserted by some scholars,²⁸ has to be challenged in this regard. Also, the general assertion made that CNO, in its current form would generally not violate LOAC, is questionable.²⁹ Above all, CNA can affect the functioning of a State, when manipulating or deleting data in computer systems of critical infrastructure systems. The list of critical infrastructure systems will slightly differ from State to State. By way of example, the following areas identified by the German Federal Office of Security of Information Technology (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) can be considered as critical infrastructure systems:³⁰ transportation and traffic (postal services, local traffic, roads, rail system, aviation, sea and inland navigation); energy (nuclear plants, distribution and transfer systems of electricity, oil, gas); hazardous substances (chemical and biological agents, nuclear reactors); information and telecommunication technology; finance, currency and insurance (banks, insurance companies, financial service providers, stock markets); public utilities (health, emergency and rescue sector, disaster control, food and water supply, waste management); government, administration, justice, police, customs and armed forces.\nMany of these critical infrastructure systems are based on computer-based control systems, such as the generation and distribution of electricity or telecommunications. Some function entirely on the basis of an Internet connection, including the banking and stock exchange systems. Other areas are increasingly reliant on the Internet, for example the so-called e-justice and e-government. In any technologically highly developed, post-industrial State most of the critical infrastructure systems can be deemed to depend on the operability and efficiency of electronic data transfer. The devastating effects and the subsequent disruption of the ordre public caused by a CNA are limited only by the imagination of the reader. Therefore, cyber security plays a paramount role for the national security of many States and was noted as one of the major perils for the Alliance's security in NATO's Strategic Concept of 2010 (see supra I).\nThere is open source information available in the media on CNA being conducted during peacetime.\nThe only publicly known case, in which the attribution of a CNA to a particular State can be asserted, was the penetration and temporary disabling of Syrian air defence networks, especially the radar systems, by Israel on 6 September 2007, immediately followed by an airstrike by Israel's Air Force destroying Syria's Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Deir-Az-Zur.³¹ ³⁰ See the list of critical infrastructure systems, available at https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/Publikationen/Faltblaetter/F17KritischeInfrastruktur.html.\n³¹ Ben-David, supra note 8.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) A more prominent case of a successful CNA against a State are the DDoS-attacks launched against several critical infrastructure systems in Estonia during the 27 April – 18 May 2007 timeframe. The “attacks”³² targeted websites and communication channels of the government and commercial services.³³ For example, the web-services of the major banks Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank were (at one-time) interrupted for 1,5 hours;³⁴ the website of a governing coalition party was defaced;³⁵ emergency phone numbers were disengaged for a short time;³⁶ and three major Estonian Internet Service Providers and some online news providers were disconnected (although it is unclear for how long).³⁷ The estimated physical (because of the disengagement of emergency phone numbers) and economic damage caused by the DDoS-attacks remains unclear. The attacks most probably originated from the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the relatively simple DDoS-methods and the political context of the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, it is asserted that the “attackers” were politically motivated private persons (hacktivism).³⁸ Another example of successful CNA during peacetime are the defacement and DDoS-attacks launched against Lithuania between 28 June and 1 July 2008. The CNA may have been connected either to the amendment of Lithuania’s laws to prohibit the display of symbols of the Soviet Union or the singing of its anthem in public³⁹ or to the unilateral veto⁴⁰ against discussions on an EU energy partnership deal with Russian Federation. Over 300 Lithuanian websites were defaced, including those of the Government.⁴¹ Given the pro-Russian contents of the defacement, as well as the subject of the (unsolicited) spam emails “Hackers United against external threats to Russia”, the CNA is assumed to have originated with nationalistic, private hacker groups (hacktivism).42 On the contrary, the “Conficker” worm, reported to have been created by Russian criminals, was not aimed at State structures, as it spread worldwide, affecting both private and official networks. It did gain national interest of the victim States, when it began to affect governmental and military computer systems, including those of the British Parliament,43 and the French and British air forces and navies.44 The worm “Stuxnet”, which affected over 100.000 computer systems worldwide between June and September 2010, targeted industrial control systems of gas pipelines and power plants based on Siemens software, aiming to establish remote control of the systems and to hide any changes in the computer systems from the operators of the equipment.45 As the vast majority of the infections affected Iran’s critical infrastructure systems, in particular of the nuclear power plant near Bushehr, and the worm’s reach and complexity obviously required enormous personnel and budgetary investments as well as a considerable amount of time to write the code (in secrecy), the involvement of a foreign organization or State is suspected.46 Although there is no respective open source information, it must be assumed that, in the past, CNA were also successfully launched against NATO’s computer systems. The *Analysis and Recommendations of the Group of Experts on a New Strategic Concept for NATO* presented on 17 May 2010 noted: “Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern”.⁴⁷ Furthermore, CNA were conducted during times of armed conflict, as for example during *Operation Allied Force*⁴⁸ (24 March – 10 June 1999) launched by 10 NATO Member States⁴⁹ against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the beginning of the operation, websites and the mailing system of NATO were blocked and infected by a virus (Melissa), apparently originating in Serbia.⁵⁰ Furthermore, some defacement attacks were launched by politically motivated individuals (hacktivism) from Serbia and Russia (*Black Hand, From Russia with Love, Russian Hacker Union*, etc.) against websites of NATO and NATO Member States.⁵¹ Equally, some hackers groups (politically) supporting the NATO operation (e.g. *Dutchthreat* or *Kosovo Hackers Group*) tried to infiltrate the governmental websites of Yugoslavia.⁵² Moreover, it is suspected that the President of the USA, *Bill Clinton*, did authorize the *Central Intelligence Agency* (CIA) to penetrate the computer systems of banks in Greece, Lebanon, Russia and Cyprus in order to clear the banking accounts of the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia *Slobodan Milošević*.⁵³ As the respective plans are said to have been ‘Foreign-made’ ‘Stuxnet’ Computer Virus’, *The Washington Post* online of 27 September 2010, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092706229.html.\n⁴⁷ NATO, *NATO 2020: Assured Security, Dynamic Engagement.

It can be assumed that also in the near future CNO are very likely to be used merely in support of a conventional military operation, mainly military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, or in order to influence the perception of a particular political conflict in the online media.",
    "## 2. Identification of the Origin and Attribution of Malicious CNO It will always be difficult to unequivocally identify the computer systems that malicious CNO originated from and to attribute the attack to a certain entity, group or a State.": "A cyber attack is distinguished by its rapidness. As soon as the attack is completed, the tracing of the data stream (so-called back-tracing) and news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/352059.stm; ‘CIA Ordered to Topple Milosevic’, BBC News online of 6 July 1999, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/387463. stm; and F. Rötzer, ‘CIA im Crackerkrieg gegen Milosevich?’, heise online of 24 May 1999, available at http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/2/2874/1.html.\n⁵⁴ Id.\n⁵⁵ See Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, Report (September 2009), Vol. II., pp. 217 et seq., available at http://www.ceig.ch/pdf/IIFFMCG_Volume_II.pdf; and J. Markoff, ‘Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks’, The New York Times online of 13 August 2008, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=2&amp;em.\n⁵⁶ For more details, see id.\n⁵⁷ Id.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) thus the identification of the originating computer system are highly improbable. It is highly unlikely that hackers will leave any tangible evidence, for example in the protocols of the intrusion detection systems of the attacked network, as such evidence in these protocols is easy to delete once the network is penetrated.\nMoreover, and further aggravating the issue, a cyber-attack can be conducted “anonymously”, for example by using one of the (often) free of charge anonymisation services offered on the Internet which would hide the unique characteristics of the hackers’ computer system. These unique characteristics are the so-called IP address⁵⁸ as well as other technical data⁵⁹ a computer sends while connected to the Internet.\n⁵⁸ An IP address (Internet Protocol number) is a twelve digit number, which identifies a computer or another network device during an Internet session. An IP data package is the basic element of data transmission via the Internet. It comprises: a header (containing information on the source, destination, status and fragmentation of the transmitted data) and a payload (containing the transmitted data). At the very beginning of the Internet, the IANA (see supra note 1) assigned static IP addresses, i.e. IP addresses permanently assigned to a particular user, to companies, organizations, universities and also to individuals. The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only. After the particular Internet session the dynamic IP address is assigned to another user and client of the respective Access Provider. At present, the so-called static IP-addresses are only being used for leased Internet-lines of major corporations and other entities.\n⁵⁹ These include: Media Access Control address (MAC address) or – for the operating system Apple – the Airport ID of a computer (order of numbers, which clearly identifies a computer hardware); Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, details on the assignment of a MAC address or Airport ID to an IP address); Service Set Identity (SSID, details on the network name); Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol (WEP, coded details about the network); as well as details on the operating system and its adjustments. These details are – if not blocked – automatically transferred during the Internet session to any computer requesting this information by a so-called PING (Packet InterNet Grouper). A PING is computer software sending an ICMP-Echo-Request data package to the destination address of the host which is to be scanned, i.e. to the IP address, to the Domain Name System name (DNS name) or to the Network Basic Input Output System name (NetBIOS name) of the targeted host. The targeted system automatically responds by an ICMP-Echo-Reply, if – according to the usual adjustments of the system – the system supports the ICMP package.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) Furthermore, the Internet offers possibilities for deception in regard to the identity of the hackers' computer systems. It is perfectly possible to feign someone else's IP address and other technical data (so-called malicious misrepresentation or spoofing) and thus to operate in the Internet under someone else's\"cyber-identity\". The connection to the Internet can also be established via a mobile phone or other device with a feigned identity number. Additionally, the data stream can be conducted through the whole globe via a chain of computers of numerous unsuspecting individuals, if so-called zombie software (partly offered free of charge on the Internet) has been secretly installed on the respective computers by using Trojans. One of these computers could subsequently be misused as the sender of the data stream (so-called remote control). Thus, in the case of a cyber attack, even after a back tracing of the malicious data stream, the victim can seldom be sure as of the identification and geographical location of the computer system the attack originated from.\nAbove all, even if a malicious data stream of a cyber attack would indeed be successfully back-traced to the hackers' computer systems, it will – highly probable – remain unproven which individuals of which citizenship and on who's orders were operating the systems identified. Therefore, the attribution of a cyber attack to a certain individual, group, entity or State will most probably be based on unproven suspicions or indications only.\nConsequently, it will be very unlikely to recognize at first sight – and probably even after detailed technical analysis – whether the attack was conducted by a mischievous teenager, by a criminal (including a terrorist), by a group with extremist or terrorist background or by the adversary Party in an armed conflict.\nThese uncertainties will surely add to the complexity of both the legal analysis of a cyber attack and the victim's decision on choosing a subsequent course of action. Considering the difficulty in identifying and locating the hackers' computer systems and – most importantly – attributing the attack, in most cases it will remain in doubt whether national police forces and public prosecutors or, in the framework of international judicial cooperation, the police forces and public prosecutors of a foreign State, or the armed forces (in the case the attack occurs during an already existing armed conflict and is believed to have originated with a party to the armed conflict, or in the case the effects of the cyber-attack are comparable to a conventional armed attack and trigger the right to self-defence) retain main responsibility to deal with the case.",
    "## 3. CNO in Modern Warfare The significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations is manifold.": "Whilst most armed conflicts in this day and age are occurring in regions that are technologically less sophisticated (e.g. Afghanistan, Sudan or Chad), this does not result in the irrelevance of the Internet and of CNO. It must be taken into consideration that, in regard to communication abilities and collection of open source information, the parties to armed conflicts in less well developed regions are also essentially dependent on – aside from radio traffic – wireless Internet connectivity, as other communication and information systems (e.g. telecommunication media, print media, telephone lines) are often non-existent.\nIt is especially evident in the context of so-called asymmetric warfare and in the hands of non-state actors, for instance terrorists, that CNO can be a powerful weapon, primarily against post-industrial States and their potent armed forces. More than ever, post-industrial States have technologically highly developed armed forces at their disposal, which correspondingly react most sensitively to technical disorder. It is the dependence on the technology which makes them extremely vulnerable to a cyber attack.\nAs CNO can be conducted from any place in the world by as little as a few experts and, in addition, are extraordinarily inexpensive when compared with conventional military operations, they offer a particularly practical and extremely powerful\"weapon\". Therefore, all aspects of CNO (see supra II.1) show an increasing significance in the context of national as well as of international security.\nAs the Head of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Co-ordination Centre stated already in 2008:\"Cyber war can become a very effective global problem because it is low-risk, low-cost, highly effective and easily globally deployable. It is almost an ideal weapon that nobody can ignore\".60 MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) ## III. Legal Analysis of CNO Although some scholars plead for a general prohibition of CNO, currently such a ban does not exist.⁶¹ However, many international and domestic legal restrictions do apply to CNO – a fact which makes a legal analysis a complex undertaking.\nApart from the fundamental principle of public international law, namely the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations, a number of specific areas of public international law may apply to CNO. As data packages pass through the territory of several States when sent via the Internet, the provisions of territorial sovereignty must be considered. Also, data manipulations might – under certain circumstances – be judged as intervention in domestic affairs of a State, which would be considered illegal under public international law. Further, because satellite technology is involved, space law and especially treaties relating to satellites must be considered. As CNO can interfere with telecommunication systems and always result in data amendments in the working storage of the attacked computer system, both international telecommunications law and international copyright law (in regard to software) require a thorough analysis. In case human rights treaty law is generally applicable, their respective provisions must be considered, especially in regard to secrecy of correspondence, telecommunications and data protection, as well as to the right to receive and impart information and ideas. Restraints for CNO can further result from the provisions of diplomatic and consular law, whenever diplomatic or consular computer systems are involved. Furthermore, it has been asserted that international environmental law principles of good neighbourhood and of the prevention of significant trans-boundary harm would be applicable to CNO in analogy.⁶² In addition, the provisions of ⁶¹ A. D’Amato pleads for a general prohibition of CNO, emphasizing that the stability of the international community depends on the free flow of information (p. 68) and that every nation has a vital interest in the operationability of the Internet (p. 69), see A. D’Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’, in M.N. Schmitt &amp; B.T. O’Donnell (eds.), *Computer Network Attack and International Law* (Newport / Rhode Island, US Naval War College, 2002), pp. 59–71, pp. 67–69. See also: T. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position. Viewing Information Warfare as Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’, Vol. 30 *Case Western Reserve* J.I.L. 1998, p. 600.\n⁶² Such assertion is made – emphasizing that the Internet is a global resource comparable to the natural environment – by T. Stein &amp; T. Marauhn, ‘Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen’, Vol. 60 *Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht* 2000, p. 21. A similar approach REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) respective national law systems, especially constitutional and criminal law, must always be taken into consideration.\nGiven the variety of areas of law involved and the limited scope of this survey, the following remarks will be restricted to the analysis of LOAC, focusing on the provisions of the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Annex to the Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (HR), the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GC) and their Additional Protocols I (AP I) and II (AP II) (2). However, first of all, it must be examined under which conditions LOAC applies to CNO (1).",
    "## 1. The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict According to common Article 2 of the GCs, LOAC applies to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.": "In practice, armed conflicts surely can be considered as the main case of application of LOAC. Pursuant to the prevailing opinion an is taken by the (non-binding) OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems of 1992, which call for cooperation of States (Principle 6) in the area of comprehensive protection of information systems (Principle 4), and which stipulate an imperative of deliberation in the use of information systems (Principle 3), see OECD Doc. OCDE/GD(92)190. However, an analogous application of international environmental law provisions is not convincing because of the lack of an “unintended omission” or of the absence of regulation. International telecommunication law, in particular the provisions of the (almost universally ratified) Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) of 22 December 1992, binds ITU Member States to far-reaching obligations in regard to the protection of communication and information systems (see in particular Articles 6, 33, 38, 45 and 47 of the ITU Constitution).\n These are: Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949; Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949; Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) international armed conflict occurs when one or more States have recourse to “armed force” against another State, regardless of the legality, reasons or the intensity of this confrontation.⁶⁶ This opinion is confirmed by the Commentary on the GC which states that “any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2”.⁶⁷ Art. 1(4) AP I extends the definition of international armed conflict to include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination.⁶⁸ A non-international armed conflict within the meaning of the common Article 3 GCs occurs when one or more non-governmental organized armed groups are involved and the situation reaches a certain threshold of confrontation, distinguishing it from internal disturbances, riots or acts of banditry (see also Art. 1 AP II).⁶⁹ Thus, a situation of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and consequently the application of LOAC is given, when States or – under certain circumstances – organized armed groups use “armed force” against the other Party.\nUnsurprisingly, LOAC is applicable to all CNO conducted either in support of conventional military operations carried out in the event of an already ongoing armed conflict or conducted as the first step preparing the immediate start of conventional military operations altogether comprising an armed conflict.\nWhether “cyber war”, i.e. military operations conducted exclusively by the means of the Internet or other computer networks without the employment of other weaponry (in the following referred to as: “isolated” CNO), will ever per se be classified as “use of armed force” and thus comprise an armed conflict, depends on future State practice. As there is an absence of detailed academic work⁷⁰ on this particular ⁶⁶ See D. Fleck (ed.), *The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law* (Oxford / New York, Oxford University Press, 2008, 2nd ed.), §§ 202 and 210; see also a compendium of scholar opinions in: International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), *How is the Term “Armed Conflict” Defined in International Humanitarian Law?*, Opinion Paper (March 2008), p. 1 et seq., available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf.\n⁶⁷ J.

J.P. Terry describes cyberwar as a “lesser form of international conflict”, see J.P. Terry, ‘Responding to Attacks on Critical Computer Infrastructure. What REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) question, the following remarks will show criteria useful for the assessment whether particular types of “isolated” CNO constitute an armed conflict (A.). Furthermore, it will be analysed how the ius in bello terms “attack”, “act of violence” and “hostilities” apply to CNO (B.).",
    "## A. “Isolated” CNO as Armed Conflict As stated above, an (international or non-international) armed conflict occurs when States or – under certain circumstances – (a State and/or) organized armed group(s) use “armed force” against each other.": "Of course, the notion of “use of armed force” – indicating that differences and confrontations did indeed reach the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and thus trigger the applicability of the ius in bello – is to be distinguished from the term “use of (armed)” force pursuant to Article 2(4) UN Charter, although the two terms are closely related. Whenever a State conducts actions considered as a “use of armed force” in the meaning of ius ad bellum against another State, this indicates the outbreak of hostilities reaching the level of “use of force” in the meaning of ius in bello and thus the threshold of an armed conflict triggering the applicability of LOAC – with the possible exception of quick, discrete and “surgical” use of force in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter without further retort by the victim (as e.g. the bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osirak/Iraq by Israeli Air Force in 1981).\nIn the following, criteria for the assessment whether a particular type of “isolated” CNO constitutes an armed conflict will be developed. The question whether a certain type of CNO can be deemed as “use of armed Targets? What Rules of Engagement?”, in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 434; see also the remarks by L. Doswald-Beck, 'Some Thoughts on Computer Network Attack and the International Law of Armed Conflict', in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 165.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning) will be examined (while – apart from the above stated exception – exactly the same criteria can indicate whether “use of force” in the meaning of the *ius ad bellum* is given). However, most academic writings on CNO do refer to “use of armed force” in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter. References to such writings will be made when useful and appropriate in the discussion of the term “use of armed force” in the *ius in bello* meaning.\nAccording to the traditional understanding, the assumption is that the “use of armed force” requires the employment of kinetic weaponry; that is the employment of a tool designed to cause kinetic effects of physical nature on a body or on an object. CNO are usually neither designed nor intended to directly cause kinetic effects. The transfer of data and its delay or interruption, as well as the manipulation, suppression or deletion of data cannot be deemed to cause kinetic effects in the common meaning of the term. Therefore, a significant qualitative difference between CNO and conventional weapons can be identified. In contrast, some similarities between CNO and biological or chemical weapons (hereinafter referred to as BC weapons) can be conceived. The use of BC weapons does not cause destruction in conventional sense, because these weapons do not set free any kinetic energy.72 The employment of BC weapons is considered as a form of “use of armed force” because, although not resulting in physical destruction of material, these weapons are employed in order to cause death or injury to living things.73 Thus, in the case of BC weapons, the term “weapon” is defined with reference to their effects rather than their method, which perfectly corresponds with the effects-based approach inherent to public international law. Consequently, the majority of scholars rightly insist on an effects-based interpretation of the term of “use of armed force” in the context of CNO.74 Therefore, in the following, different categories of potential effects which can be caused by CNO will be illustrated in order to determine when CNO must be deemed as “use of armed force”.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) i. Death, Physical Injury and/or Destruction of Property According to the nearly uniform opinion among scholars (to which the author of the present survey subscribes), a CNO – similarly to the effects caused by BC weapons – should be considered as “use of armed force” if it results in death, physical injury or the destruction of property.75 As illustrated above (II.1.C), CNO can indirectly76 cause such effects.\nAccording to a minority view amongst scholars, a CNO, even if it indirectly causes death, physical injury or the destruction of property, qualifies as “use of armed force” only if at the same time it amounts to a “use of structural force”.77 “Structural force” is described in the public international law literature as a physical incursion into a State’s M.N. Schmitt proposes a catalogue of criteria indicating that CNO constitute “use of force”: - severity of the effects, i.e. threat of physical injury or destruction of property, - immediacy of the occurrence of the negative consequences, - direct nexus between the CNO and the negative consequences caused, - invasiveness of the consequences on foreign territory, - measurability of the consequences, - pre-assumption of illegitimacy of the CNO according to national rules and to the International Public Law, based on the prima facie illegitimacy of the use of force in international relations (the author of the present survey only guesses that the term “illegitimacy” indeed stands for “illegality”).\nSee Schmitt, supra note 28, pp. 65 et seq. This approach is not convincing because of the circular reasoning it contains. It cannot be decided whether a particular act is indeed illegal, by the simultaneous assertion of the illegality of the same act.\nterritory without the employment of conventional or mass destruction weapons, leaving the attacked State the “use of armed force” as the only option open for effective self-defence (e.g. in the case of intentional spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing widespread flooding).78 Thus, “structural force” is deemed as “use of armed force” in the sense of Article 2 (4) UN Charter if it has the same effect as an “armed attack” triggering the right to self-defence pursuant to Article 51 UN Charter.79 However, it must be considered that there is a significant qualitative difference between “use of armed force” and an “armed attack”. According to the prevailing opinion among public international law scholars and the settled jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, an “armed attack” only occurs when the “use of armed force” reaches a certain level of intensity in regard to its effects and scale.80 When this threshold of intensity is not reached, the respective actions in question can still be considered as “use of armed force”, although they do not constitute an “armed attack”.81 Therefore, the above presented view asserting that CNO can only be deemed as “use of force” when it comprises “structural force”, and thus setting the terms of “use of armed force” and “armed attack” equal, is highly questionable.\nFurthermore, some scholars demand additional criteria to be met in order to classify CNO as “use of armed force”. This is the direct nexus between the CNO and physical damage, the immediacy of the occurrence of the physical damage (in the sense that the occurrence of the damage does not depend on any additional factors) as well as whether the damage can be foreseen at all.82 However, these criteria determine the conditions of attribution of the damage to a certain action, and are therefore not relevant for the specification of the term “use of armed force”.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) ## ii. Destruction of Data Some academic writings assert that the destruction of data of substantial importance and/or of significant economical value should be considered as “use of armed force”.83 But, in consequence, it would need to have been ascertained in every particular case whether indeed data of some economic value has been destroyed or whether the CNO is to be considered as trivial because the compromised or deleted data is of little or no value. In addition, it must be considered that in the case of a so-called DoS attack84 data will not be destroyed but rather its use and information value will be diminished by delay of its transmission or by temporary denial of access to the data. Furthermore, the effect of CNO directed against data only is not comparable to the effects of conventional weapons, for example a bombardment, or of BC weapons. Therefore, the above presented view is not convincing, as it is of little practical value and could lead to unbearable results.\nOther scholars assert that at least the destruction of data symbolizing an asset (e.g. data of an electronically operated banking account) should be considered as “use of armed force”.85 They suggest that this assessment would reflect the obligation to protect civilian objects from dangers arising from military operations.86 However, electronic assets, accounts, demands or claims cannot be equated with objects or physical property and their destruction cannot be compared with the destructive effects on physical property caused by conventional (or BC) weapons. Therefore, the opinion presented above does not capture accurately the translation of the traditional understanding of the term “use of armed force” into the “cyberspace”.\nIf, however, a CNO was to be directed against the whole economic or banking system as one of the critical infrastructures of a State, the situation must be judged differently (see III.1.A.v. on critical infrastructure systems).",
    "## iii. “Theft” of Data Moreover, it is asserted that the “theft” of particular data should be considered as “use of armed force”, if information of vital interest to MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) a State, for instance classified information, is compromised.⁸⁷ Also the “theft” of all data of military nature (regardless of the classification) should be considered as “use of armed force”.⁸⁸ However, the “theft” of data (CNE) merely represents a kind of modern espionage which is not generally forbidden under public international law.⁸⁹ All in all, “theft” of data – even classified data of importance to the military – cannot be deemed as having similar effects as conventional or BC weapons and therefore cannot be judged as “use of armed force”. Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict.": "iv. Massive Disruption of Military C3-Systems Additionally, some scholars assert that the destruction⁹⁰ or medium to long-term disruption⁹¹ of military command, control and communication systems (C3-systems) is to be deemed as “use of armed force”. Indeed, the intended outcome, namely the disruption of military communications and the consequent restraining ability on military command and control, can be achieved both through the physical destruction of respective systems by conventional weapons and through the massive disruption of the systems by malicious CNO. As such, the effect of a corresponding CNO is quite comparable to the effects of the employment of conventional weapons. This view is supported by Article VI of the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities concluded between the USA and the Soviet Union on 12 June 1989.⁹² According to this provision, the disruption of command and control systems (C2), resulting even in a mere restraint of those systems, would be regarded as a dangerous military activity. Given the political context of the agreement the provision indicates that a – massive – disruption of ⁸⁷ Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846, 855; contra: Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 10.\n⁸⁸ Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846 and 856.\n⁸⁹ D’Amato, supra note 61, p. 67; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 32 with further references. In regard to CNO as a modern form of espionage see: von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 134. Apart from the penalisation of espionage resulting from respective national law systems, spying is restrained by certain provisions of public international law, e.g. the taboos stated by the diplomatic and consular law protecting diplomatic and consular archives and correspondence, i.e. respective electronic databases and communication via the Internet.\n⁹⁰ See M. Bothe, ‘Völkerrechtliche Verhinderung von Gewalt (ius contra bellum)’, in W. Graf Vitzthum, Völkerrecht (Berlin, De Gruyter, 2001), Section 8, § 10.\n⁹¹ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8. See also Sharp, supra note 75, p. 129, who recognizes the right to self-defence against an attack on computer networks of “vital interest” to a State.\n⁹² Vol. 28 I.L.M. 1989, pp. 877 et seq.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) military C3-systems could indeed be seen by States as “use of force”.",
    "## v. Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems There is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems⁹³ by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]”⁹⁴ This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.": "However, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment.⁹⁵ This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems.⁹⁶ It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing ⁹³ See supra section II.1.C.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n⁹⁵ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n⁹⁶ Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599. See also Sharp, supra note 75, pp. 129 et seq. Contra: Dinstein, supra note 75, p. 105; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8, who demand the occurrence of physical damage outside the targeted computer networks in order to qualify CNO as use of force.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) similar effects on critical infrastructure systems would be considered as “use of armed force”.\nvi. Intermediate Result All in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities” As far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).",
    "## A. Prohibited Methods and Means of Warfare ### i. Perfidy Article 23(f) HR in conjunction with Articles 38 and 39 AP I as well as Article 12 AP II prohibit the misuse of distinctive emblems, signs, signals or flags of protected entities¹⁰¹, including those of the Red Cross and its associated entities and of the United Nations. Furthermore, the provisions ban the misuse of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Party to the particular armed conflict as well as of the adversary Party (though, in regard to the latter only while engaging in attack or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations).¹⁰² Moreover, Article 44(3) AP I states the obligation for all members of the armed forces to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.": "Although the above-mentioned provisions refer to physically visible symbols carried by individuals or objects, the rules can also be observed in the\"cyberspace\". The spirit and purpose of these provisions is to preserve the neutrality of certain entities and to protect certain groups against dangers arising from military operations. Therefore, Parties to an armed conflict must not misuse the identity of these entities or groups. Consequently, the\"cyber identity\"(i.e. website, e-mail address, email header, IP address and other technical data sent while connected to the Internet) of one of the protected organisations or groups must not be used at any time during the conduct of CNO. A simple example of the ban would be that the header of an e-mail sent to adversary armed forces, containing a virus, indirectly causing physical damage outside the targeted network, must not show, for instance, the Red Cross as the ¹⁰¹ Also see the Annex I to the AP I.\n¹⁰² Exceptions to those rules are stated in Article 39(3) AP I in regard to espionage and to the conduct of armed conflict at sea.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) sender. Also, while hacking adversary computer networks, the CNO forces must not feign technical data, which would lead to presumption of the “cyber identity” of a civilian if the concrete CNO conducted is to be considered as an “attack” or an “act preparatory to an attack” in the meaning of Article 44(3) AP I. Moreover, any respective manipulation of websites belonging to the protected entities would be illegal.\nIn addition, the prohibition of Article 23(b) HR in conjunction with Article 37(1) AP I, to kill, injure or capture an adversary under recourse to perfidy, applies to CNO. In general terms, perfidy describes an act which leads the adversary to erroneously believe that he or she is entitled to, or is obliged to accord protection under LOAC (see the definition of perfidy in Article 37(1) AP I). The ban covers, inter alia, intentional dissemination of misinformation to the adversary Party about the intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender, or about an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, as well as feigning civilian, non-combatant or protected status (e.g. of a United Nations employee or of a member of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, by using respective emblems, signs, signals or uniforms, see Art. 23(f) HR and Art. 37(1) AP I). The aforementioned misinformation can generally be transmitted by the means of the Internet, for example by e-mail or as a statement on a website. As already stated (e.g. supra II.2.), the “cyber-identity” of the aforementioned protected persons can easily be feigned in the “cyberspace”. However, the above described dissemination of misinformation or feigning of the (cyber) identity of a protected person is prohibited only if it directly¹⁰³ results in the death, injury or capture of the adversary.\nConversely, legal ruses of war in the sense of Article 24 HR and Article 37(2) AP I, which are merely aimed to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly, offer a broad field of application to CNO. Thus, it is imaginable that a Party to an armed conflict establishes a so-called honey net around its own computer network, i.e. an outside-network building a buffer around its own computer network, which is only minimally protected against hacking and, technically speaking, ¹⁰³ The specific nexus between the dissemination of misinformation or feigning of a protected status on the one hand and the death, injury or capture of the adversary on the other hand is required in order to establish accountability of armed forces, as – in the traditional understanding of warfare – all military actions always pursue death, injury or capture of the adversary, see M. Bothe, K.J. Partsch &amp; W.A. Solf, *New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts. Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949* (The Hague / Boston / London, Martinus Nijhoff, 1982), Art. 37 (1) AP I, no. 2.4, p. 204.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) appears perfectly realistic, but contains false information, for example on planned military operations or on the status of own forces and their location. Such a honey net could be established specifically in the hope that the adversary Party would compromise it and – in this way – obtain false information.",
    "## ii. Methods or Means of Warfare Prohibited Because of the Nature of Their Effects Some methods or means of warfare are prohibited because of the nature of their effects.": "According to Article 51(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. This ban refers to the dissemination of certain information to the civilian population. As this information could be easily transmitted by means of computer-based information systems, for example via e-mail or as information on a website, this prohibition must be considered during the planning and the conduct of CNO.\nFurthermore, Article 23(e) HR, Article 35(2) AP I, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980 and its Protocols¹⁰⁴ as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 prohibit the employment of methods or means of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Equally, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57(2)(a)(iii) AP I stipulate that an attack which may be expected to cause loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. As it is perfectly possible that a cyber attack could indirectly cause physical damage (see supra II.1.C), it must be examined beforehand whether the anticipated (indirect) effect would be excessive in the sense of the above-mentioned provisions.¹⁰⁵ In this regard, as the expected effects of concrete CNO ¹⁰⁴ Those are: Protocol on Non-Detectable Fragments (Protocol I) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III) of 1980, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV) of 1995, and Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V) of 2003.\n¹⁰⁵ See E.T. Jensen, ‘Unexpected Consequences from Knock-Out Effects: A Different MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) are to be assessed, the practical criteria for the examination resemble to ones for the analysis of the effects caused by other (e.g. conventional) weapons.\nMoreover, according to Article 51(4) AP I indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Attacks are deemed to be indiscriminate, when they are not or cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or when their effects cannot be limited (see Art. 51(4)(a)-(c) AP I). It is perfectly possible that CNO equated to an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello) or an “act of violence” (see III.1.B.) could have indiscriminate effects, in the case of global, uncontrolled spreading of viruses, bugs and – in future – micro-mechanical organisms via the Internet. However, damaging software could be programmed in such a way so as to only target computer systems with specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. An uncontrolled spread of malware, as well as any cascade effects, could be easily prevented by appropriate programming.\nHowever, the vast majority of malicious CNO will not achieve the quality of a “method or means of combat, the effects of which are indiscriminate”. The inductive conclusion drawn from the examples given by Articles 51(4)(a) and (b) AP I shows that the provisions refer to methods or means of combat which result in physically “devastating” physical effects.\nFinally, Article 35(3) in connection with Article 55(1) AP I prohibits the employment of methods or means of warfare which may be expected to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. This provision covers only especially extensive, intensive and long-lasting environmental damage, which exceeds the scale of both the quality and quantity of “ordinary” environmental damage which is expected to occur in the course of combat.[108] Severe damage of the natural environment can always be caused when dangerous forces are set free, such as by radiation escaping from a nuclear power plant, the explosion of a chemical or pharmacy installation, or the breaking of a dam or dyke. As such effects could be caused indirectly by CNO Standard for Computer Network Operations?', Vol. 18 American University LL.Rev. 2003, pp. 1178 et seq.; and Schmitt, supra note 28, p. 82.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) (see supra II.1.C), the prohibition of Article 35(3) AP I must be also considered for operations primarily conducted within “cyberspace”.",
    "## B. Prohibited Targets Furthermore, LOAC provisions granting protection for non-combatants and for civilian objects are of significance for CNO.": "### i. Civilians Population and Individual Civilians The civilian population as a whole, as well as individual civilians (see Art. 50 AP I), are protected against “attacks”¹⁰⁹, “acts of violence”¹¹⁰ and “effects of hostilities”¹¹¹. Accordingly, CNO which are not deemed as being “use of force”, and thus not comprising an “attack” (in the meaning of *ius in bello*), “act of violence” or “effect of hostilities” (see supra III.1.B) would not be contrary to LOAC and – from the perspective of international humanitarian law – could legally be directed against civilians¹¹².\nConversely, CNO considered as being a “use of force” could only be directed against civilians launching malicious CNO against the armed forces constituting “direct participation in hostilities” within the meaning of Article 51(3) AP I and Article 13(3) AP II¹¹³. In order to distinguish between private hacking as “direct participation in hostilities” and hacking as a mere criminal act, all circumstances of a specific case must be taken into consideration (see also supra II.2).\nFurthermore, according to Article 48 AP I, the Parties to an armed conflict must, at all times, distinguish between the civilian population ¹⁰⁹ See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52(1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n¹¹⁰ See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Art. 13(2) AP II.\n¹¹¹ See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n¹¹² Concurring: Schmitt, supra note 106, p. 378.\n¹¹³ The examination of the different approaches to the question of the direct participation of civilians in hostilities, and especially of the temporal scope of the loss of protection otherwise granted by international humanitarian law, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further examination, the following literature may be recommended selectively: N. Melzer, *Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities* (Geneva, ICRC, May 2009), available at www.icrc.org; Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 51 AP I, no. 2.4.2.2., p. 303; M.N. Schmitt, ‘Direct Participation in Hostilities and 21st Century Armed Conflict’, in H. Fischer, U. Froissart, W.H. von Heinegg &amp; C. Raap (Hrsg.), *Krisensicherung und humanitärer Schutz – Crisis Management and Humanitarian Protection. Festschrift für Dieter Fleck* (Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), pp. 505–529.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) and combatants. Admittedly, the conventional (visual) criteria for the identification of a combatant as set out in Articles 43 and 44 AP I are not helpful for CNO, during which the acting individuals are not physically visible.¹¹⁴ However, the obligation to distinguish can also be met within “cyberspace”. In the “virtual world”, a computer of a combatant can be distinguished from the computer of a non-combatant according to its IP address and other technical data automatically sent during an Internet session. It can easily be verified by everybody in one of the official WhoIs?¹¹⁵ Internet databases to which person or entity a specific IP address or an IP address range is assigned. In addition, the “owner” and the responsible administrators of websites can be found in the WhoIs? databases. Thus, in principle it can be confirmed whether a particular actor in the “virtual world” should be considered as a member of the armed forces or as a civilian.\nNevertheless, some challenges as to the identification of a person acting in the “cyberspace” as a combatant will remain. For example, a member of regular armed forces and thus a combatant will not be recognizable as such when using his private computer at home, the latter sending during an Internet session information identifying the user as a civilian. This resembles the “real world” situation, when a soldier is not wearing the uniform when being at home and thus cannot visually be identified as a combatant as well. Thus, the remaining challenges are not new and will mostly resemble similar “real world” cases.",
    "## ii. Civilian Objects According to Article 48 AP I, civilian objects must be distinguished from military objectives. Civilian objects must not be the objects of attack or reprisals (Articles 48, 52(1)-(2) and 57 AP I, see also Art. 23(g) HR and further specific regulations in Articles 53–56 AP I and Articles 14–16 AP II). Generally, this principle of distinction, as well as the above-mentioned prohibitions, can also be observed within the “virtual world”.": "¹¹⁴ See the profound examination by S. Watts, ‘Combatant Status and Computer Network Attack’, Vol. 50 No. 2 Virginia J.I.L. 2010, pp. 391–447.\n¹¹⁵ The WhoIs? databases of the RIRs (see supra note 58) provide information on which IP address is assigned to which end customer (in the case of dynamic IP-addresses: to which Internet Service Provider). Thus, the database DENIC (available at http://www.denic.de) provides respective information on “.de” domains, and the database RIPE (available at http://www.ripe.net) on the other domains in Europe, InterNIC (available at http://www.internic.net/whois.html) on the domains “com”, “edu”, “int”, “net” or “org”. The database Network Information Center (available at http://www.nic.com) leads to official and regional WhoIs? databases as well as to respective private databases available online.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) Viruses, bugs and – in the future – micro-mechanical organisms can be programmed in such a way that they only affect military computer networks, namely those with corresponding IP addresses or IP address ranges. The identification of a computer or computer system as military or civilian can be made by a search request of a specific IP address in one of the Whols? databases (see supra III.2.B.i).\nMalicious CNO against a purely military computer network, such as the Intranet or other communication systems of armed forces supported by the Intranet, would be perfectly legal in regard to LOAC. CNO launched against civilian computer networks – in case they are not to be considered as military objectives pursuant to Article 52(2) AP I – would only be allowed when they are not to be considered as an “attack” in the sense of Article 49(1) AP I, i.e. would not cause any physical damage (see supra III.1.B). A mere suppression or denial of access of the civilian population to a computer network or to specific data as well as the mere manipulation or the deletion of particular data would not fall under the prohibition of attack, as long as physical damage in- or outside the directly affected networks is not caused. For example, the deletion of a particular electronically operated bank account of a civilian would not be forbidden as a matter of LOAC.\nDistinction between civilian objects and military objectives becomes difficult when a computer network is used by both combatants and non-combatants (so-called dual use objects). This applies especially to the global Internet where, apart from the civilian population, there is a high probability that it will also be used by Parties to an armed conflict for the purposes of communication and information gathering. According to some scholars, the Internet is to be deemed as a military objective as soon as it is also used for military purposes.[116] Considering that nowadays the Internet is as an equally important means of communication as telephone and telegraph connections were in the past, the aforementioned opinion is supported by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had already in 1956 classified the latter as military objectives.[117] [116] This assertion is made in general terms, referring to communication networks used for both military and civilian purposes by Jensen, supra note 105, pp. 1160 et seq.; J.P. Terry, ‘The Lawfulness of Attacking Computer Networks in Armed Conflict and in Self-Defense in Period Short of Armed Conflict: What are the Targeting Constrains?’, Vol. 169 Mil. L. Rev. 2001, p. 85; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 35. Similarly: Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, no. 2.4.2., p. 324.\n[117] Annex Military Targets to the Draft Rules for the Limitation of Dangers Incurred However, some scholars refuse to classify civilian means of communication merely co-used for military purposes as a military objective.¹¹⁸ Indeed, in order to avoid any “automatism”, a thorough examination of the definition of a military objective provided by Article 52(2) AP I will be necessary. The definition clearly refers to objects only. Thus, at first sight, it seems doubtful whether the “virtual world” of the Internet can be deemed to be an object. However, the computer system Internet is not a purely intellectual construction. It comprises a multitude of objects, including technical equipment as servers, cables, cross points and access points; thus, the provision is in general applicable to the Internet. According to this definition, the computer system Internet or any other (dual use) computer network is to be considered as a military objective, if - the computer network makes an effective contribution¹¹⁹ to military action by its use, and - the total or partial destruction or neutralization of the computer network offered a definite (i.e. concrete and perceptible)¹²⁰ military advantage (in regard to the overall military operation).¹²¹ Whether the Internet meets these conditions depends on the degree to which the other Party to the armed conflict uses the Internet, and whether this Party can easily revert to alternative communication means. Therefore, the characterisation of the Internet, or other dual use computer networks, as a military objective depends on the circumstances of the specific situation, especially on the degree of the dependence of the adversary Party on those networks, *ergo* on the level of the technologisation of the adversary armed forces.\nEven if the Internet was to be considered to be a military objective in the context of a particular armed conflict, it must be considered that it would be allowed to be attacked only as far as its physical elements by the Civilian Population in Time of War, see Fleck, supra note 66, § 443. von Heinegg, supra note 77, pp. 150 seq.\n¹¹⁸ The examination, whether the “contribution” shall have a particular significance for or shall merely support a certain military operation, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further details see Fleck, supra note 66, § 442; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.3., p. 324.\n¹²⁰ See R. Wedgwood, ‘Proportionality, Cyberwar and the Law of War’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 225; and von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 150.\n¹²¹ Wedgwood, supra note 120, p. 225; Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 149; Fleck, supra note 66, § 444; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.4. See also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) of the ICC Statute.\n(e.g. server, cross points and WLAN¹²² access points) are located on the territory of one of the Parties to the particular armed conflict. But, even if such an attack was conducted successfully, a connection to the Internet could still be made from the same geographical area, for example via a mobile phone or other device enabled with respective software permitting Internet connectivity. Thus, an attack against the Internet intending the *quasi* disabling of a network within the area of conflict is unlikely to succeed.¹²³ ### iii. Objects under Special Protection Additionally, LOAC provides special protection against attacks and reprisals for specific civilian objects. Corresponding prohibitions can be found in Article 27 HR, Articles 19-21 GC I., Articles 22 and 24 GC II., Articles 18 *et seq.* GC IV, Article 4 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954 and in its Protocol I of 1954 and Protocol II of 1999, Articles 12, 21, 24 *et seq.*, 54(2) and (4) and 56 AP I as well as in Articles 11 and 14–16 AP II. Pursuant to these provisions, special protection is provided for dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (*inter alia* drinking water installations and water irrigation works), medical units and transportation, historic monuments, works of art or places of worship etc. As far as incorporating computer-based elements, the above-mentioned objects could be disrupted or even destroyed by the means of a cyber attack. Therefore, the computer-based cooling system of a nuclear power plant, for example, must not be disabled by remote control, a drinking water installation must not be destroyed by a computer controlled opening and closing of its valves, a medical aircraft must not be caused to crash by manipulation of data of an air traffic control system, or a museum protected by *ius in bello* must not be flooded by the remote activation of a water sprinkler system.\n¹²² In general terms, a *Wireless Local Area Network* (WLAN) describes a local wireless and direct connection between two or more mobile end devices (*clients*), which are equipped with a wireless access device. Usually, *clients* access the Internet via a central bridge (so-called *access point*). The bridge has a *router*, which – based on a *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol* (DHPC server) – assigns a dynamic IP address to each *host* (see also *supra* note 58) seeking connectivity to the Internet.\n¹²³ In order to disable the Internet, all its thirteen *root servers* (i.e. the main *domain name servers* or the main server layer of the internet) would have to be disconnected or destroyed. For security reasons, those servers are located in different, secret sites which are geographically distant. It is asserted that disabling up to ten of the *root servers* would probably merely delay the data transfer via the Internet.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) Generally speaking, the aforementioned provisions, which provide special protection for specific civilian objects, can cease in the event that the objects are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy or for regular, significant and direct support for military operations of the enemy. In general terms, an active counter-CNO (back-hacking) could be legally launched once a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit to stop the forbidden activities, and after such warning has remained unheeded. For example, in the case of the computer network of a medical unit, if it had been identified as the location of origin of malicious CNO, as an exception, an active counter-CNO could be launched if a warning about the forthcoming back-hacking had been given in advance, for instance in the form of a pop-up window which would appear on the computer screen of the cyber attacker.\nIt should also be considered that as far as an attack against an object is forbidden, the enemy must not be led to attack such objects. Therefore, CNO which would correspondingly manipulate a targeting database of the adversary Party to the armed conflict in order to assign the data of the geographical coordinates of a civilian object under special protection to the data of a military objective of the adversary Party would be forbidden. As an example, when manipulating the adversary's targeting database, a munitions factory must not be assigned the geographical coordinates of a hospital.",
    "## 3. The Law of Neutrality and the Cyberspace First of all, neutrality in the sense of *ius in bellum* has to be distinguished from permanent neutrality (e.g. the cases of Austria, the Holy See, and Switzerland), i.e. the legal obligation undertaken in peacetime to remain neutral in cases of armed conflict or war between other States, and from the mere neutrality policy (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Ireland), which, nonetheless, can have some legally binding effects due to the situation of confidence created in which other States may rely on the (political) declarations to remain neutral (principle of estoppel).¹²⁴ ## A. The Applicability of the Law of Neutrality Neutrality is a particular status of a State not Party to an armed conflict of significant scope or – according to a traditional view – to a “war ¹²⁴ Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1105.": "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) in the legal sense” between other States.¹²⁵ Although it is not crucial for the purposes of the present survey to decide which view is to be followed, it may be mentioned that the International Court of Justice stated in its Advisory Opinion on the *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* of 8 July 1996 that “[...] the principle of neutrality [...] is applicable [...], to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used”.¹²⁶ However, it must always be taken into consideration that in particular cases the rules governing neutrality may be modified by collective self-defence provisions such as Article 51 UN Charter and Article 5 North Atlantic Treaty (depriving a State of the possibility to legally join an armed conflict or a war on the side of the aggressor) and by (binding) decisions taken by the UN Security Council (see Articles 2(5) and 25 and Chapter VII UN Charter; the obligation to assist any action taken by the UN in accordance with the Charter would forestall a State to appeal to its neutrality).¹²⁷ In the following it will be shown that the rules on neutrality – which are over 100 years old – apply to military operations conducted in cyberspace (during an armed conflict of significant scope or a “war in the legal sense”). When examining the law of neutrality, no difference will be made between the specific rules applying to land, air or sea warfare, as the distinction between these areas is not relevant to CNO.",
    "## B. Prohibition of CNO Causing Physical Damage First and foremost, the rules of neutrality protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the neutral State, see Article 1 Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907 (HC V) and Art. 1 Hague Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 1907 (HC XIII).": "Thus, the principle of neutrality prohibits causing physical damage on the sovereign territory of a neutral State.¹²⁸ Consequently, a malicious ¹²⁵ The discussion of the question, whether rules on neutrality apply in situations of war (in legal sense) only or also in situations of an armed conflict of significant scope, would exceed the scope of the present survey. Interested readers may be referred to the assessment in Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1106.\n¹²⁶ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90 (emphasis by the author).\n¹²⁷ See further details at Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1103; and G. Walker, ‘Information Warfare and Neutrality’, Vol. 33 *Vanderbilt J. Transnational L.* 2000, pp. 1079 et seq.\n¹²⁸ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90. Regarding the necessary criteria of a “physical encroachment” CNO would only breach the principle of the territorial inviolability of a neutral State if it – indirectly – caused physical damage (deaths, injuries or destruction of property) on the territory of a neutral State or medium to long-term disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a neutral State (see supra III.1.A.vi). In this regard, the physical damage could refer to physical components (technical equipment) of the Internet and/or other computer systems as well as to objects/living beings outside the affected computer systems.\nIn regard to critical infrastructure systems, it must always be considered that they can be shared by several States (e.g. an electricity distribution system is shared between Laos and Thailand, between Venezuela and Brazil, between Canada and the United States and between Indonesia and Singapore; one telecommunication system is shared by several States in East and South-East Asia).[129] Thus, before targeting a critical infrastructure system of the adversary it must always be examined (in addition to other LOAC provisions relevant to targeting) whether the estimated damage could also automatically affect another State neutral to the particular armed conflict or war.\n# C. The Use of Telecommunication Means Belonging to a Neutral State According to Article 8 HC V, a neutral State can allow the belligerents to use\"telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals\". The neutral State also has the right to restrict or prohibit the use of such communication means, if applied (by the State, companies or individuals) impartially to all belligerents (see Article 9 HC V and 9(1) HC XIII).\nIn regard to the Internet, such a restriction or prohibition could be enforced by a neutral State by applying certain software to all Internet cross points located on its territory. The software would scan the Internet traffic for data packages sent by the belligerents and delete them. Of course, a neutral State could also disable all technical components supporting the worldwide network Internet and located on its territory. This way, the belligerents would not use the Internet components located on the territory of the neutral State, although the Internet system as such would continue to function and could be further used by the Parties to the armed conflict or war.\nsee Greenberg, Goodman &amp; Soo Hoo, supra note 75, p. 10.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) In the case one Party of the armed conflict or war used the computer network located on the territory of a neutral State to send malicious CNO to the computer systems of the other belligerent – either by launching malicious CNO from neutral State’s territory or by using Internet cross points or other technical equipment located on its territory –, the neutral State would have the right to “protect” its neutral status by taking appropriate actions (e.g. back-hacking). If it failed to do so, the neutral State would have – pursuant to the principle of non-discrimination of belligerents – the obligation to allow the affected belligerent to take action against the malicious CNO.^[130]^ ## D. Data Streams Passing the Territory of a Neutral State However, it is perfectly possible, even likely, that in the course of the conduct of CNO the data stream carrying malicious components (e.g. viruses or worms) to the adversary’s computer systems passes Internet crossing points and servers located on the territory of a neutral State. However, this would not result in violation of neutrality law.\nFirst of all, a Party to a conflict cannot influence whether a data stream crosses the technical components of the Internet situated on the territory of a neutral State or not. Every data stream sent via the Internet is divided in data packages, each one of which takes – out of millions possible routs – a certain route from cross point to cross point around the globe. The respective choices are done automatically by the Internet system (depending on the traffic load on the routes) and cannot be foreseen or influenced.^[131]^ Furthermore, according to Article 3(a) HC V and Article 5 HC XIII, a Party to an armed conflict or war is only forbidden to “[e]rect on the territory [including territorial waters] of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea”, and pursuant to Article 3(b) HC V to “[u]se any installation of this kind established by them [i.e. belligerents] before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages”. This means that belligerents are allowed to use all non-purely military means of communication erected or established on the territory of a neutral State – by whomever – before the armed conflict or war. This would apply to all technical installations on the territory of ^[130]^ Jensen, *supra* note 105, pp. 238 et seq.\n^[131]^ Walker, *supra* note 127, pp. 1079 et seq.\nthe neutral State being part of the worldwide, already existing computer network Internet, as it is – also historically – a communication means used by civilians also. It is asserted within academic writings that the establishment of a connection to the Internet as such should be deemed as similar to the forbidden “erecting” of a “communication apparatus”.¹³² However, it is more convincing to compare the establishment of a connection to the Internet to connecting to the worldwide telephone system by dialling a phone number – which would surely not be considered as forbidden “erecting” a “communication apparatus” by a belligerent.\nFinally, it must be endorsed that, because the law of neutrality does provide special provisions referring to communication systems on land or in territorial waters (Art. 3 HC V and Art. 5 HC XIII), there is no need or space for an (analogous) application of rules relating to the innocent passage through territorial waters, as asserted in some scholar writings.¹³³ ## IV. Concluding Remarks Given the developments in technology and reliance on computer systems, in the future, CNO are likely to be of considerable significance for the planning and conduct of military operations. One of the reasons is that both the equipment and the conduct of CNO are extremely inexpensive when compared to conventional military operations. In addition, CNO can be conducted by only a few experts and from any location distant from the (traditional) area of combat, which safeguards the physical protection of the members of armed forces involved. Furthermore, as mentioned above, within the context of so-called asymmetric warfare, CNO can be a powerful weapon in the hands of non-state actors against the technologically highly developed armed forces of post-industrial States sensitive to malfunctions of their computer networks.\nOwing to the potential physical effects of CNO, the Parties to any future armed conflict in which CNO will be carried out, either in support of conventional military abilities or as the only method of war fighting conducted, will have to observe relevant LOAC provisions. The spirit and purpose of these protection granting rules, as well as the values they reflect, are timeless. They offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n¹³² *Id.* ¹³³ Such an assertion is made by Walker, *supra* note 127.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) Neither a lack of regulation nor a need for amendment of “aged” norms can be identified, when a teleological interpretation of the provisions is applied.\nThe future practice of the armed forces will show whether adjustments in the interpretation of relevant LOAC provisions will have to be made. The practice of the international community will decide, whether in the future it will be considered necessary to increase the level of the humanitarian protection during armed conflicts, and thus to include protection e.g. of data contained in computers or computer networks of non-combatants. Unquestionably, lawyers advising armed forces will have ever more to deal with corresponding questions of law and to understand the technical details of CNO as an emerging weapon, means or method of war.",

    "## Summary – Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict": "The Internet has become the most essential means of communication and information. This results in a high dependency upon reliable operations of Internet based communication systems, especially those supporting critical infrastructure systems. Given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to security, the vulnerability of computer systems has become a significant matter of (national or collective) security to many States as well as to NATO. The potential conduct of “Computer Network Operations” (CNO), i.e. military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks, presents some legal challenges. This survey first examines the nature of CNO and discusses the difficulties of identification of the origin and of attribution of a malicious action carried out via or in the cyberspace to a certain actor. After the presentation of some criteria for the qualification of CNO as “use of armed force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning), the survey argues that the Laws of Armed Conflict, including the over hundred years old principles and provisions of neutrality, do apply to CNO. At the same time, it demonstrates that the provisions offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.",

El presente artículo examina en primer lugar la naturaleza de las CNO y analiza las dificultades que existen para identificar el sistema en el que tiene su origen un ataque y la posterior atribución de una conducta delictiva llevada a cabo en el espacio cibernético (o a través de este último) a un sujeto determinado. Tras la exposición de algunos criterios que permiten calificar las CNO como “uso de fuerza armada” (en el sentido del *ius in bello*), el artículo demuestra que el Derecho de los Conflictos Armados resulta de aplicación a las CNO, incluidos los principios y preceptos ultra-centenarios relativos a la neutralidad. Al mismo tiempo, pone de manifiesto cómo ese Derecho ofrece un nivel de protección humanitaria comparable con el que es de aplicación en el campo del uso de armas convencionales."

Introduction\nIn this day and age, the Internet is one of the most important means of communication and information. During the last 30 years it has gradually become an essential aspect of the economy in a globalized world and plays an indispensable role in, amongst other things, the administrative and judicial systems of technologically developed countries. All in all, critical infrastructure systems in States with high levels of technology dependency are acutely reliant upon reliable and effective operations of Internet based communication systems. Thus, given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to the security, protection and defence of the integrity of computer networks, the vulnerability of these communication systems has become a significant matter of national security to many such States. Accordingly, the current National Security Strategies of the USA, of the United Kingdom,\n The Internet is globally administered by a Californian (US) non-profit, public-benefit corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which, in the framework of a Public Private Partnership, is associated with and reports to the US Department of Commerce (although, according to the information on ICANN’s website, the organisation heavily emphasises its international nature and independence). ICANN bears global responsibility for ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet as well as for coordinating the Internet system of unique identifiers, i.e. for the assignment of IP-address ranges (since 2005 not directly to users but to regional organisations – see infra note 58). It is further responsible for the generic codes and country codes of the Internet top level domain as well as for the management and maintenance of the (secret) Internet root server system (see infra note 122). ICANN is the successor organization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which was executing the above-mentioned tasks directly on behalf of the US Department of Commerce (information available at http://www.icann/org/en/factsheets/factsheet.html; unless indicated otherwise, all URLs cited in the present survey were last visited on 31 November 2010). Originally, it was planned to transform ICANN into an independent organization in October 2006. During the 2nd World Summit on the Information Society, organized by the UN in Tunis in November 2005, it was proposed to submit ICANN (and thus the Internet itself) to management by the UN. The USA rejected this proposal and declared its intent to keep the control over ICANN for the time being (information available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/).\n The President of the United States of America, National Security Strategy (May 2010), p. 27 et seq., available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf.\n Her Majesty’s Government, A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The National Security Strategy (October 2010), pp. 11 and 27, available at http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191639.pdf?CID=PDF&amp;PLA=furl&amp;CRE=nationalsecuritystrategy.\n\nand Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defence White Paper, all seek to address the issue of cyber-attacks. According to NATO’s new Strategic Concept of 19 November 2010, cyber threats are one of the major perils for the security of the Alliance in the future decade. Similar concerns are reflected in resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly over the last ten years, which regularly mention the integrity of information and communication technology in the context of international security and call for the creation of a global “culture of cyber security”. Additionally, the emerging threat of the use of\n Federal Ministry of Defence, White Paper 2006 on German Security Policy and the Future of the Bundeswehr (2006), p. 17: “Germany’s political and economic structures as well as its critical infrastructure have become more vulnerable as a result, not least where criminal activities, terrorist acts, or military attacks from or on cyberspace are concerned”; available at http://www.bmvg.de/fileserving/PortalFiles/C1256EF40036B05B/W26UWAMT995INFODE/W%202006%20eng%20DS.pdf.\n NATO, Strategic Concept For the Defence and Security of The Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Adopted by Heads of State and Government in Lisbon (19 November 2010), §§ 12 and 19, available at http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf. See also NATO, Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon, Lisbon Summit Declaration (20 November 2010), § 40: “Cyber threats are rapidly increasing and evolving in sophistication. In order to ensure NATO’s permanent and unfettered access to cyberspace and integrity of its critical systems, we will take into account the cyber dimension of modern conflicts in NATO’s doctrine and improve its capabilities to detect, assess, prevent, defend and recover in case of a cyber attack against systems of critical importance to the Alliance. We will strive in particular to accelerate NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) to Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2012 and the bringing of all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection. We will use NATO’s defence planning processes in order to promote the development of Allies’ cyber defence capabilities, to assist individual Allies upon request, and to optimize information sharing, collaboration and interoperability. To address the security risks emanating from cyberspace, we will work closely with other actors, such as the UN and the EU, as agreed. We have tasked the Council to develop, drawing notably on existing international structures and on the basis of a review of our current policy, a NATO in-depth cyber defence policy by June 2011 and to prepare an action plan for its implementation”; available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_68828.htm.\n See the resolutions Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, UN Documents A/53/70 of 4 December 1998, A/54/49 of 1 December 1999, A/55/28 of 20 November 2000, A/56/19 of 29 November 2001, A/57/53 of 22 November 2002, A/58/32 of 8 December 2003, A/59/61 of 3 December 2004, A/60/45 of 8 December 2005, A/61/55 of 6 December 2006, and A/62/17 of 5 December 2007. With regard to the creation of a global culture of cyber security, see the resolutions Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information structures,\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nthe Internet for terrorist purposes (cyber terrorism) is currently on the agendas of several international initiatives and programmes.7\nMilitary forces use the Internet for communication purposes and – to a certain extent – as an inherent component of particular weapon systems. Additionally, the Internet offers the possibility for offensive and/or defensive military actions by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. The military term “Computer Network Operations” (CNO) refers, generally speaking, to computer hacking and back-hacking in the context of a military operation.\nWorldwide, military forces are preparing for the fight in cyberspace. It has been alleged that Israeli armed forces have engaged in CNO activities since the early 1990s.8 The USA established a US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in Fort Meade, Maryland on 23 June 2009 (operational as of October 2010) which unified the already existing cyber capabilities of the US National Security Agency and several US military services (Army Forces Cyber Command, 24th US Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command).9 According to media reports, Belgium10, Germany11, South Korea12 (allegedly in reaction to respective North Korean endeavours), and the\nUN Documents A/55/63 of 4 December 2000, A/56/121 of 19 December 2001, A/57/239 of 20 December 2002, and A/58/199 of 23 December 2003.\n\nUnited Kingdom (Government Communications Headquarters) have established similar commands in 2009, while China did so in 2010.\nUndeniably, CNO have become an important weapon, means or method of warfare extending the – traditionally clearly defined – battlefield to the global cyberspace. Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n See C. Clark, ‘StratCom Plows Ahead on Cyber’, Online Defense and Acquisition Journal of 29 June 2009, available at http://www.dodbuzz.com/2009/06/29/stratcom-plows-ahead-on-cyber/.\n T. Branigen, ‘Chinese Army to Target Cyber War Threat’, Guardian online of 22 July 2010, available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/22/chinese-army-cyber-war-department.\n According to some reports, Chinese armed forces built up CNO capabilities already some years ago, see e.g. Northrop Grumman Corporation - Information Systems Sector, Capability of the People’s Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation (Report of 9 October 2009 Prepared for The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), available at http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## II. The Nature and Significance of CNO\nIn the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).\n## 1. Forms and Effects of CNO\nThe concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA).\nThe above-mentioned components of CNO are strongly interrelated. An adversary’s CNA can help one’s own CND when analysed appropriately. A CNE cannot be conducted without CNA, as the information to be gathered by CNE will mostly be protected by firewalls, passwords and other barriers that are erected to prevent an adversarial CNA. Finally, CNA cannot be conducted without CNE, as without information gathering on the targeted network’s architecture and systems the CNA would effectively be conducted blindly.\nWhile the practical value of the taxonomy of CND/CNE/CNA therefore is questionable, it will be presented in more detail below as most academic writings and media reports refer to this classification.\n## A. CND\nCND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\none’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone). The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies, merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA.\n## B. CNE\nAccording to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”. This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage.\nAccording to open source reports, the vast majority of CNO activities conducted during peacetime consist of CNE. For example, already in 2007, the British intelligence service MI5 warned all financial service providers and companies in Great Britain against concerted cyber espionage endeavours by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. In summer 2007, the computer systems of Germany’s Federal Chancellery as well as those of some federal ministries were infected with spyware (i.e. espionage software) reported to have originated from China. According to the Annual Report 2009 of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, computer systems of Germany’s federal and state governments and of private businesses were targeted by hundreds of (successful and/or unsuccessful) CNE. Foreign intelligence\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nservices were likely to be the organizers of, or are involved in, most of these. In the USA, over 100 foreign intelligence services currently endeavour to intrude computer systems located in the country, as the US Deputy Secretary of Defence stated in September 2010. NATO’s computer networks are also subject to constant – and partly successful – CNE.\nThere is no open source information as to the employment of CNE during an armed conflict. However, it can be assumed that CNE is very likely to be used in support of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance.\n## C. CNA\nCNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”. These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks.\nRelatively harmless, data modification in the course of a CNA can modify and deface a website (defacement). This is often conducted by hackers who wish to express their political view (hacktivism). Another widely spread form of CNA is the Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(DDoS-attack), which can cause delays in the data transfer process, the denial of access to computer systems or servers (e.g. the targeted websites or a email service) or result in the (only temporary) disabling of the targeted systems. The particular DDoS-techniques are as diverse as the – partly very effective – countermeasures developed since 2000.\nHowever, the deletion or modification of data in a successfully intruded computer network can be more hazardous. Hackers can generate wrong information, for instance in the military environment the content of electronically transmitted orders, plans and maps or the localization data of military targets contained in a targeting-database.\nMoreover, it is possible that a CNA could – indirectly – cause death, physical injury or physical destruction of property. As far as chemical plants, nuclear power stations, oil refinery installations, gas store installations or electrical power distribution installations have or rely on computer-based control systems, these systems could be penetrated and manipulated. Thus, a CNA could cause the explosion of a nuclear power plant if the cooling systems were disabled via remote control. The same applies to computer-based control systems of transportation systems. By manipulation of the rail points, train derailments or collisions could be caused; penetration and minimal amendments to the programming of an air traffic control system could result in aircraft incidents. Therefore, the classification of CNO as a non-lethal weapon, as asserted by some scholars, has to be challenged in this regard. Also, the general assertion made that CNO, in its current form would generally not violate LOAC, is questionable.\n\nAbove all, CNA can affect the functioning of a State, when manipulating or deleting data in computer systems of critical infrastructure systems. The list of critical infrastructure systems will slightly differ from State to State. By way of example, the following areas identified by the German Federal Office of Security of Information Technology (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) can be considered as critical infrastructure systems: transportation and traffic (postal services, local traffic, roads, rail system, aviation, sea and inland navigation); energy (nuclear plants, distribution and transfer systems of electricity, oil, gas); hazardous substances (chemical and biological agents, nuclear reactors); information and telecommunication technology; finance, currency and insurance (banks, insurance companies, financial service providers, stock markets); public utilities (health, emergency and rescue sector, disaster control, food and water supply, waste management); government, administration, justice, police, customs and armed forces.\nMany of these critical infrastructure systems are based on computer-based control systems, such as the generation and distribution of electricity or telecommunications. Some function entirely on the basis of an Internet connection, including the banking and stock exchange systems. Other areas are increasingly reliant on the Internet, for example the so-called e-justice and e-government. In any technologically highly developed, post-industrial State most of the critical infrastructure systems can be deemed to depend on the operability and efficiency of electronic data transfer. The devastating effects and the subsequent disruption of the ordre public caused by a CNA are limited only by the imagination of the reader. Therefore, cyber security plays a paramount role for the national security of many States and was noted as one of the major perils for the Alliance's security in NATO's Strategic Concept of 2010 (see supra I).\nThere is open source information available in the media on CNA being conducted during peacetime.\nThe only publicly known case, in which the attribution of a CNA to a particular State can be asserted, was the penetration and temporary disabling of Syrian air defence networks, especially the radar systems, by Israel on 6 September 2007, immediately followed by an airstrike by Israel's Air Force destroying Syria's Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Deir-Az-Zur.\n See the list of critical infrastructure systems, available at https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/Publikationen/Faltblaetter/F17KritischeInfrastruktur.html.\n Ben-David, supra note 8.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nA more prominent case of a successful CNA against a State are the DDoS-attacks launched against several critical infrastructure systems in Estonia during the 27 April – 18 May 2007 timeframe. The “attacks” targeted websites and communication channels of the government and commercial services. For example, the web-services of the major banks Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank were (at one-time) interrupted for 1,5 hours; the website of a governing coalition party was defaced; emergency phone numbers were disengaged for a short time; and three major Estonian Internet Service Providers and some online news providers were disconnected (although it is unclear for how long). The estimated physical (because of the disengagement of emergency phone numbers) and economic damage caused by the DDoS-attacks remains unclear. The attacks most probably originated from the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the relatively simple DDoS-methods and the political context of the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, it is asserted that the “attackers” were politically motivated private persons (hacktivism).\nAnother example of successful CNA during peacetime are the defacement and DDoS-attacks launched against Lithuania between 28 June and 1 July 2008. The CNA may have been connected either to the amendment of Lithuania’s laws to prohibit the display of symbols of the Soviet Union or the singing of its anthem in public or to the unilateral veto against discussions on an EU energy partnership deal with Russian Federation. Over 300 Lithuanian websites were defaced, including those of the Government. Given the pro-Russian contents\n\nof the defacement, as well as the subject of the (unsolicited) spam emails “Hackers United against external threats to Russia”, the CNA is assumed to have originated with nationalistic, private hacker groups (hacktivism).42\nOn the contrary, the “Conficker” worm, reported to have been created by Russian criminals, was not aimed at State structures, as it spread worldwide, affecting both private and official networks. It did gain national interest of the victim States, when it began to affect governmental and military computer systems, including those of the British Parliament,43 and the French and British air forces and navies.44\nThe worm “Stuxnet”, which affected over 100.000 computer systems worldwide between June and September 2010, targeted industrial control systems of gas pipelines and power plants based on Siemens software, aiming to establish remote control of the systems and to hide any changes in the computer systems from the operators of the equipment.45 As the vast majority of the infections affected Iran’s critical infrastructure systems, in particular of the nuclear power plant near Bushehr, and the worm’s reach and complexity obviously required enormous personnel and budgetary investments as well as a considerable amount of time to write the code (in secrecy), the involvement of a foreign organization or State is suspected.46\n\nAlthough there is no respective open source information, it must be assumed that, in the past, CNA were also successfully launched against NATO’s computer systems. The *Analysis and Recommendations of the Group of Experts on a New Strategic Concept for NATO* presented on 17 May 2010 noted: “Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern”.\nFurthermore, CNA were conducted during times of armed conflict, as for example during *Operation Allied Force* (24 March – 10 June 1999) launched by 10 NATO Member States against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the beginning of the operation, websites and the mailing system of NATO were blocked and infected by a virus (Melissa), apparently originating in Serbia. Furthermore, some defacement attacks were launched by politically motivated individuals (hacktivism) from Serbia and Russia (*Black Hand, From Russia with Love, Russian Hacker Union*, etc.) against websites of NATO and NATO Member States. Equally, some hackers groups (politically) supporting the NATO operation (e.g. *Dutchthreat* or *Kosovo Hackers Group*) tried to infiltrate the governmental websites of Yugoslavia. Moreover, it is suspected that the President of the USA, *Bill Clinton*, did authorize the *Central Intelligence Agency* (CIA) to penetrate the computer systems of banks in Greece, Lebanon, Russia and Cyprus in order to clear the banking accounts of the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia *Slobodan Milošević*. As the respective plans are said to have been\n‘Foreign-made’ ‘Stuxnet’ Computer Virus’, *The Washington Post* online of 27 September 2010, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092706229.html.\n NATO, *NATO 2020: Assured Security, Dynamic Engagement.

Bendrath, ‘Der Kosovo-Krieg im Cyberspace’, *heise online* of 19 July 1999, available at http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/6/6449/1.html.\n *Id.*\n See ‘Serbs Flee Yugoslavia’, *BBC News* online of 25 May 1999, available at http://\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nobjected within the US-Congress due to possible diplomatic friction and potential loss of trust in regard to the international banking system, it remains unclear whether the CNO was conducted.\nAlso, in the weeks before and during the course of the five-day hostilities between the Russian Federation and Georgia (South Ossetia) which started on 8 August 2008, significant CNO were launched against Georgia. Those were DDoS-attacks and defacements mainly directed against Georgian government websites but also the web portals of Georgia’s National Bank and news agencies, partly resulting in shutting down the website servers for hours or days. Although suspicions of the – officially disclaimed – involvement of the Russian Federation in the cyber incidents remain, these incidences were allegedly attributed to the criminal organization “Russian Business Network” (hosting and renting illegal web services).\nIn regard to the aforementioned armed conflicts, it can be inferred that the conduct of CNO did partly influence the perception of the conflict in the public, but not its overall outcome. It can be assumed that also in the near future CNO are very likely to be used merely in support of a conventional military operation, mainly military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, or in order to influence the perception of a particular political conflict in the online media.\n## 2. Identification of the Origin and Attribution of Malicious CNO\nIt will always be difficult to unequivocally identify the computer systems that malicious CNO originated from and to attribute the attack to a certain entity, group or a State.\nA cyber attack is distinguished by its rapidness. As soon as the attack is completed, the tracing of the data stream (so-called back-tracing) and\nnews.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/352059.stm; ‘CIA Ordered to Topple Milosevic’, BBC News online of 6 July 1999, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/387463. stm; and F.

Markoff, ‘Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks’, The New York Times online of 13 August 2008, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=2&amp;em.\n For more details, see id.\n Id.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nthus the identification of the originating computer system are highly improbable. It is highly unlikely that hackers will leave any tangible evidence, for example in the protocols of the intrusion detection systems of the attacked network, as such evidence in these protocols is easy to delete once the network is penetrated.\nMoreover, and further aggravating the issue, a cyber-attack can be conducted “anonymously”, for example by using one of the (often) free of charge anonymisation services offered on the Internet which would hide the unique characteristics of the hackers’ computer system. These unique characteristics are the so-called IP address as well as other technical data a computer sends while connected to the Internet.\n An IP address (Internet Protocol number) is a twelve digit number, which identifies a computer or another network device during an Internet session. An IP data package is the basic element of data transmission via the Internet. It comprises: a header (containing information on the source, destination, status and fragmentation of the transmitted data) and a payload (containing the transmitted data). At the very beginning of the Internet, the IANA (see supra note 1) assigned static IP addresses, i.e. IP addresses permanently assigned to a particular user, to companies, organizations, universities and also to individuals. The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only. After the particular Internet session the dynamic IP address is assigned to another user and client of the respective Access Provider. At present, the so-called static IP-addresses are only being used for leased Internet-lines of major corporations and other entities.\n These include: Media Access Control address (MAC address) or – for the operating system Apple – the Airport ID of a computer (order of numbers, which clearly identifies a computer hardware); Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, details on the assignment of a MAC address or Airport ID to an IP address); Service Set Identity (SSID, details on the network name); Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol (WEP, coded details about the network); as well as details on the operating system and its adjustments. These details are – if not blocked – automatically transferred during the Internet session to any computer requesting this information by a so-called PING (Packet InterNet Grouper). A PING is computer software sending an ICMP-Echo-Request data package to the destination address of the host which is to be scanned, i.e. to the IP address, to the Domain Name System name (DNS name) or to the Network Basic Input Output System name (NetBIOS name) of the targeted host. The targeted system automatically responds by an ICMP-Echo-Reply, if – according to the usual adjustments of the system – the system supports the ICMP package.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nFurthermore, the Internet offers possibilities for deception in regard to the identity of the hackers' computer systems. It is perfectly possible to feign someone else's IP address and other technical data (so-called malicious misrepresentation or spoofing) and thus to operate in the Internet under someone else's \"cyber-identity\". The connection to the Internet can also be established via a mobile phone or other device with a feigned identity number. Additionally, the data stream can be conducted through the whole globe via a chain of computers of numerous unsuspecting individuals, if so-called zombie software (partly offered free of charge on the Internet) has been secretly installed on the respective computers by using Trojans. One of these computers could subsequently be misused as the sender of the data stream (so-called remote control). Thus, in the case of a cyber attack, even after a back tracing of the malicious data stream, the victim can seldom be sure as of the identification and geographical location of the computer system the attack originated from.\nAbove all, even if a malicious data stream of a cyber attack would indeed be successfully back-traced to the hackers' computer systems, it will – highly probable – remain unproven which individuals of which citizenship and on who's orders were operating the systems identified. Therefore, the attribution of a cyber attack to a certain individual, group, entity or State will most probably be based on unproven suspicions or indications only.\nConsequently, it will be very unlikely to recognize at first sight – and probably even after detailed technical analysis – whether the attack was conducted by a mischievous teenager, by a criminal (including a terrorist), by a group with extremist or terrorist background or by the adversary Party in an armed conflict.\nThese uncertainties will surely add to the complexity of both the legal analysis of a cyber attack and the victim's decision on choosing a subsequent course of action. Considering the difficulty in identifying and locating the hackers' computer systems and – most importantly – attributing the attack, in most cases it will remain in doubt whether national police forces and public prosecutors or, in the framework of international judicial cooperation, the police forces and public prosecutors of a foreign State, or the armed forces (in the case the attack occurs during an already existing armed conflict and is believed to have originated with a party to the armed conflict, or in the case the effects of the cyber-attack are comparable to a conventional armed\n\nattack and trigger the right to self-defence) retain main responsibility to deal with the case.\n## 3. CNO in Modern Warfare\nThe significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations is manifold.\nWhilst most armed conflicts in this day and age are occurring in regions that are technologically less sophisticated (e.g. Afghanistan, Sudan or Chad), this does not result in the irrelevance of the Internet and of CNO. It must be taken into consideration that, in regard to communication abilities and collection of open source information, the parties to armed conflicts in less well developed regions are also essentially dependent on – aside from radio traffic – wireless Internet connectivity, as other communication and information systems (e.g. telecommunication media, print media, telephone lines) are often non-existent.\nIt is especially evident in the context of so-called asymmetric warfare and in the hands of non-state actors, for instance terrorists, that CNO can be a powerful weapon, primarily against post-industrial States and their potent armed forces. More than ever, post-industrial States have technologically highly developed armed forces at their disposal, which correspondingly react most sensitively to technical disorder. It is the dependence on the technology which makes them extremely vulnerable to a cyber attack.\nAs CNO can be conducted from any place in the world by as little as a few experts and, in addition, are extraordinarily inexpensive when compared with conventional military operations, they offer a particularly practical and extremely powerful \"weapon\". Therefore, all aspects of CNO (see supra II.1) show an increasing significance in the context of national as well as of international security.\nAs the Head of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Co-ordination Centre stated already in 2008: \"Cyber war can become a very effective global problem because it is low-risk, low-cost, highly effective and easily globally deployable. It is almost an ideal weapon that nobody can ignore\".60\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## III. Legal Analysis of CNO\nAlthough some scholars plead for a general prohibition of CNO, currently such a ban does not exist. However, many international and domestic legal restrictions do apply to CNO – a fact which makes a legal analysis a complex undertaking.\nApart from the fundamental principle of public international law, namely the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations, a number of specific areas of public international law may apply to CNO. As data packages pass through the territory of several States when sent via the Internet, the provisions of territorial sovereignty must be considered. Also, data manipulations might – under certain circumstances – be judged as intervention in domestic affairs of a State, which would be considered illegal under public international law. Further, because satellite technology is involved, space law and especially treaties relating to satellites must be considered. As CNO can interfere with telecommunication systems and always result in data amendments in the working storage of the attacked computer system, both international telecommunications law and international copyright law (in regard to software) require a thorough analysis. In case human rights treaty law is generally applicable, their respective provisions must be considered, especially in regard to secrecy of correspondence, telecommunications and data protection, as well as to the right to receive and impart information and ideas. Restraints for CNO can further result from the provisions of diplomatic and consular law, whenever diplomatic or consular computer systems are involved. Furthermore, it has been asserted that international environmental law principles of good neighbourhood and of the prevention of significant trans-boundary harm would be applicable to CNO in analogy. In addition, the provisions of\n A. D’Amato pleads for a general prohibition of CNO, emphasizing that the stability of the international community depends on the free flow of information (p. 68) and that every nation has a vital interest in the operationability of the Internet (p. 69), see A. D’Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’, in M.N. Schmitt &amp; B.T. O’Donnell (eds.), *Computer Network Attack and International Law* (Newport / Rhode Island, US Naval War College, 2002), pp. 59–71, pp. 67–69. See also: T. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position. Viewing Information Warfare as Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’, Vol. 30 *Case Western Reserve* J.I.L. 1998, p. 600.\n Such assertion is made – emphasizing that the Internet is a global resource comparable to the natural environment – by T. Stein &amp; T. Marauhn, ‘Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen’, Vol. 60 *Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht* 2000, p. 21. A similar approach\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nrespective national law systems, especially constitutional and criminal law, must always be taken into consideration.\nGiven the variety of areas of law involved and the limited scope of this survey, the following remarks will be restricted to the analysis of LOAC, focusing on the provisions of the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Annex to the Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (HR), the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GC) $^{63}$ and their Additional Protocols I $^{64}$ (AP I) and II $^{65}$ (AP II) (2). However, first of all, it must be examined under which conditions LOAC applies to CNO (1).\n## 1. The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict\nAccording to common Article 2 of the GCs, LOAC applies to\nall cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.\nIn practice, armed conflicts surely can be considered as the main case of application of LOAC. Pursuant to the prevailing opinion an\nis taken by the (non-binding) OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems of 1992, which call for cooperation of States (Principle 6) in the area of comprehensive protection of information systems (Principle 4), and which stipulate an imperative of deliberation in the use of information systems (Principle 3), see OECD Doc. OCDE/GD(92)190. However, an analogous application of international environmental law provisions is not convincing because of the lack of an “unintended omission” or of the absence of regulation. International telecommunication law, in particular the provisions of the (almost universally ratified) Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) of 22 December 1992, binds ITU Member States to far-reaching obligations in regard to the protection of communication and information systems (see in particular Articles 6, 33, 38, 45 and 47 of the ITU Constitution).\n$^{63}$ These are: Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949; Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949; Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\n$^{64}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\n$^{65}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\ninternational armed conflict occurs when one or more States have recourse to “armed force” against another State, regardless of the legality, reasons or the intensity of this confrontation. This opinion is confirmed by the Commentary on the GC which states that “any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2”. Art. 1(4) AP I extends the definition of international armed conflict to include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination. A non-international armed conflict within the meaning of the common Article 3 GCs occurs when one or more non-governmental organized armed groups are involved and the situation reaches a certain threshold of confrontation, distinguishing it from internal disturbances, riots or acts of banditry (see also Art. 1 AP II). Thus, a situation of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and consequently the application of LOAC is given, when States or – under certain circumstances – organized armed groups use “armed force” against the other Party.\nUnsurprisingly, LOAC is applicable to all CNO conducted either in support of conventional military operations carried out in the event of an already ongoing armed conflict or conducted as the first step preparing the immediate start of conventional military operations altogether comprising an armed conflict.\nWhether “cyber war”, i.e. military operations conducted exclusively by the means of the Internet or other computer networks without the employment of other weaponry (in the following referred to as: “isolated” CNO), will ever per se be classified as “use of armed force” and thus comprise an armed conflict, depends on future State practice. As there is an absence of detailed academic work on this particular\n See D. Fleck (ed.), *The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law* (Oxford / New York, Oxford University Press, 2008, 2nd ed.), §§ 202 and 210; see also a compendium of scholar opinions in: International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), *How is the Term “Armed Conflict” Defined in International Humanitarian Law?*, Opinion Paper (March 2008), p. 1 et seq., available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf.\n J.

J.P. Terry describes cyberwar as a “lesser form of international conflict”, see J.P. Terry, ‘Responding to Attacks on Critical Computer Infrastructure. What\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nquestion, the following remarks will show criteria useful for the assessment whether particular types of “isolated” CNO constitute an armed conflict (A.). Furthermore, it will be analysed how the ius in bello terms “attack”, “act of violence” and “hostilities” apply to CNO (B.).\n## A. “Isolated” CNO as Armed Conflict\nAs stated above, an (international or non-international) armed conflict occurs when States or – under certain circumstances – (a State and/or) organized armed group(s) use “armed force” against each other.\nOf course, the notion of “use of armed force” – indicating that differences and confrontations did indeed reach the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and thus trigger the applicability of the ius in bello – is to be distinguished from the term “use of (armed)” force pursuant to Article 2(4) UN Charter, although the two terms are closely related. Whenever a State conducts actions considered as a “use of armed force” in the meaning of ius ad bellum against another State, this indicates the outbreak of hostilities reaching the level of “use of force” in the meaning of ius in bello and thus the threshold of an armed conflict triggering the applicability of LOAC – with the possible exception of quick, discrete and “surgical” use of force in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter without further retort by the victim (as e.g. the bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osirak/Iraq by Israeli Air Force in 1981).\nIn the following, criteria for the assessment whether a particular type of “isolated” CNO constitutes an armed conflict will be developed. The question whether a certain type of CNO can be deemed as “use of armed\nTargets? What Rules of Engagement?”, in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 434; see also the remarks by L. Doswald-Beck, 'Some Thoughts on Computer Network Attack and the International Law of Armed Conflict', in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 165.\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nforce” (in the *ius in bello* meaning) will be examined (while – apart from the above stated exception – exactly the same criteria can indicate whether “use of force” in the meaning of the *ius ad bellum* is given). However, most academic writings on CNO do refer to “use of armed force” in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter. References to such writings will be made when useful and appropriate in the discussion of the term “use of armed force” in the *ius in bello* meaning.\nAccording to the traditional understanding, the assumption is that the “use of armed force” requires the employment of kinetic weaponry; that is the employment of a tool designed to cause kinetic effects of physical nature on a body or on an object. CNO are usually neither designed nor intended to directly cause kinetic effects. The transfer of data and its delay or interruption, as well as the manipulation, suppression or deletion of data cannot be deemed to cause kinetic effects in the common meaning of the term. Therefore, a significant qualitative difference between CNO and conventional weapons can be identified. In contrast, some similarities between CNO and biological or chemical weapons (hereinafter referred to as BC weapons) can be conceived. The use of BC weapons does not cause destruction in conventional sense, because these weapons do not set free any kinetic energy.72 The employment of BC weapons is considered as a form of “use of armed force” because, although not resulting in physical destruction of material, these weapons are employed in order to cause death or injury to living things.73 Thus, in the case of BC weapons, the term “weapon” is defined with reference to their effects rather than their method, which perfectly corresponds with the effects-based approach inherent to public international law. Consequently, the majority of scholars rightly insist on an effects-based interpretation of the term of “use of armed force” in the context of CNO.74\nTherefore, in the following, different categories of potential effects which can be caused by CNO will be illustrated in order to determine when CNO must be deemed as “use of armed force”.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\ni. Death, Physical Injury and/or Destruction of Property\nAccording to the nearly uniform opinion among scholars (to which the author of the present survey subscribes), a CNO – similarly to the effects caused by BC weapons – should be considered as “use of armed force” if it results in death, physical injury or the destruction of property.75 As illustrated above (II.1.C), CNO can indirectly76 cause such effects.\nAccording to a minority view amongst scholars, a CNO, even if it indirectly causes death, physical injury or the destruction of property, qualifies as “use of armed force” only if at the same time it amounts to a “use of structural force”.77 “Structural force” is described in the public international law literature as a physical incursion into a State’s\n\nM.N. Schmitt proposes a catalogue of criteria indicating that CNO constitute “use of force”:\n- severity of the effects, i.e. threat of physical injury or destruction of property,\n- immediacy of the occurrence of the negative consequences,\n- direct nexus between the CNO and the negative consequences caused,\n- invasiveness of the consequences on foreign territory,\n- measurability of the consequences,\n- pre-assumption of illegitimacy of the CNO according to national rules and to the International Public Law, based on the prima facie illegitimacy of the use of force in international relations (the author of the present survey only guesses that the term “illegitimacy” indeed stands for “illegality”).\nSee Schmitt, supra note 28, pp. 65 et seq. This approach is not convincing because of the circular reasoning it contains. It cannot be decided whether a particular act is indeed illegal, by the simultaneous assertion of the illegality of the same act.\n\nterritory without the employment of conventional or mass destruction weapons, leaving the attacked State the “use of armed force” as the only option open for effective self-defence (e.g. in the case of intentional spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing widespread flooding).78 Thus, “structural force” is deemed as “use of armed force” in the sense of Article 2 (4) UN Charter if it has the same effect as an “armed attack” triggering the right to self-defence pursuant to Article 51 UN Charter.79 However, it must be considered that there is a significant qualitative difference between “use of armed force” and an “armed attack”. According to the prevailing opinion among public international law scholars and the settled jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, an “armed attack” only occurs when the “use of armed force” reaches a certain level of intensity in regard to its effects and scale.80 When this threshold of intensity is not reached, the respective actions in question can still be considered as “use of armed force”, although they do not constitute an “armed attack”.81 Therefore, the above presented view asserting that CNO can only be deemed as “use of force” when it comprises “structural force”, and thus setting the terms of “use of armed force” and “armed attack” equal, is highly questionable.\nFurthermore, some scholars demand additional criteria to be met in order to classify CNO as “use of armed force”. This is the direct nexus between the CNO and physical damage, the immediacy of the occurrence of the physical damage (in the sense that the occurrence of the damage does not depend on any additional factors) as well as whether the damage can be foreseen at all.82 However, these criteria determine the conditions of attribution of the damage to a certain action, and are therefore not relevant for the specification of the term “use of armed force”.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n## ii. Destruction of Data\nSome academic writings assert that the destruction of data of substantial importance and/or of significant economical value should be considered as “use of armed force”.83 But, in consequence, it would need to have been ascertained in every particular case whether indeed data of some economic value has been destroyed or whether the CNO is to be considered as trivial because the compromised or deleted data is of little or no value. In addition, it must be considered that in the case of a so-called DoS attack84 data will not be destroyed but rather its use and information value will be diminished by delay of its transmission or by temporary denial of access to the data. Furthermore, the effect of CNO directed against data only is not comparable to the effects of conventional weapons, for example a bombardment, or of BC weapons. Therefore, the above presented view is not convincing, as it is of little practical value and could lead to unbearable results.\nOther scholars assert that at least the destruction of data symbolizing an asset (e.g. data of an electronically operated banking account) should be considered as “use of armed force”.85 They suggest that this assessment would reflect the obligation to protect civilian objects from dangers arising from military operations.86 However, electronic assets, accounts, demands or claims cannot be equated with objects or physical property and their destruction cannot be compared with the destructive effects on physical property caused by conventional (or BC) weapons. Therefore, the opinion presented above does not capture accurately the translation of the traditional understanding of the term “use of armed force” into the “cyberspace”.\nIf, however, a CNO was to be directed against the whole economic or banking system as one of the critical infrastructures of a State, the situation must be judged differently (see III.1.A.v. on critical infrastructure systems).\n## iii. “Theft” of Data\nMoreover, it is asserted that the “theft” of particular data should be considered as “use of armed force”, if information of vital interest to\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\na State, for instance classified information, is compromised. Also the “theft” of all data of military nature (regardless of the classification) should be considered as “use of armed force”. However, the “theft” of data (CNE) merely represents a kind of modern espionage which is not generally forbidden under public international law. All in all, “theft” of data – even classified data of importance to the military – cannot be deemed as having similar effects as conventional or BC weapons and therefore cannot be judged as “use of armed force”. Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict.\niv. Massive Disruption of Military C3-Systems\nAdditionally, some scholars assert that the destruction or medium to long-term disruption of military command, control and communication systems (C3-systems) is to be deemed as “use of armed force”. Indeed, the intended outcome, namely the disruption of military communications and the consequent restraining ability on military command and control, can be achieved both through the physical destruction of respective systems by conventional weapons and through the massive disruption of the systems by malicious CNO. As such, the effect of a corresponding CNO is quite comparable to the effects of the employment of conventional weapons. This view is supported by Article VI of the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities concluded between the USA and the Soviet Union on 12 June 1989. According to this provision, the disruption of command and control systems (C2), resulting even in a mere restraint of those systems, would be regarded as a dangerous military activity. Given the political context of the agreement the provision indicates that a – massive – disruption of\n Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846, 855; contra: Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 10.\n Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846 and 856.\n D’Amato, supra note 61, p. 67; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 32 with further references. In regard to CNO as a modern form of espionage see: von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 134. Apart from the penalisation of espionage resulting from respective national law systems, spying is restrained by certain provisions of public international law, e.g. the taboos stated by the diplomatic and consular law protecting diplomatic and consular archives and correspondence, i.e. respective electronic databases and communication via the Internet.\n See M. Bothe, ‘Völkerrechtliche Verhinderung von Gewalt (ius contra bellum)’, in W. Graf Vitzthum, Völkerrecht (Berlin, De Gruyter, 2001), Section 8, § 10.\n Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8. See also Sharp, supra note 75, p. 129, who recognizes the right to self-defence against an attack on computer networks of “vital interest” to a State.\n Vol. 28 I.L.M. 1989, pp. 877 et seq.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nmilitary C3-systems could indeed be seen by States as “use of force”.\n## v. Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems\nThere is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]” This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.\nHowever, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment. This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems. It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing\n See supra section II.1.C.\n Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599.

Contra: Dinstein, supra note 75, p. 105; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8, who demand the occurrence of physical damage outside the targeted computer networks in order to qualify CNO as use of force.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nsimilar effects on critical infrastructure systems would be considered as “use of armed force”.\nvi. Intermediate Result\nAll in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities”\nAs far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\n2. Restraints for Malicious CNO Resulting from LOAC Provisions\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of\n\nwhich is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).\n## A. Prohibited Methods and Means of Warfare\n### i. Perfidy\nArticle 23(f) HR in conjunction with Articles 38 and 39 AP I as well as Article 12 AP II prohibit the misuse of distinctive emblems, signs, signals or flags of protected entities, including those of the Red Cross and its associated entities and of the United Nations. Furthermore, the provisions ban the misuse of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Party to the particular armed conflict as well as of the adversary Party (though, in regard to the latter only while engaging in attack or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations). Moreover, Article 44(3) AP I states the obligation for all members of the armed forces to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.\nAlthough the above-mentioned provisions refer to physically visible symbols carried by individuals or objects, the rules can also be observed in the \"cyberspace\". The spirit and purpose of these provisions is to preserve the neutrality of certain entities and to protect certain groups against dangers arising from military operations. Therefore, Parties to an armed conflict must not misuse the identity of these entities or groups. Consequently, the \"cyber identity\" (i.e. website, e-mail address, email header, IP address and other technical data sent while connected to the Internet) of one of the protected organisations or groups must not be used at any time during the conduct of CNO. A simple example of the ban would be that the header of an e-mail sent to adversary armed forces, containing a virus, indirectly causing physical damage outside the targeted network, must not show, for instance, the Red Cross as the\n Also see the Annex I to the AP I.\n Exceptions to those rules are stated in Article 39(3) AP I in regard to espionage and to the conduct of armed conflict at sea.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nsender. Also, while hacking adversary computer networks, the CNO forces must not feign technical data, which would lead to presumption of the “cyber identity” of a civilian if the concrete CNO conducted is to be considered as an “attack” or an “act preparatory to an attack” in the meaning of Article 44(3) AP I. Moreover, any respective manipulation of websites belonging to the protected entities would be illegal.\nIn addition, the prohibition of Article 23(b) HR in conjunction with Article 37(1) AP I, to kill, injure or capture an adversary under recourse to perfidy, applies to CNO. In general terms, perfidy describes an act which leads the adversary to erroneously believe that he or she is entitled to, or is obliged to accord protection under LOAC (see the definition of perfidy in Article 37(1) AP I). The ban covers, inter alia, intentional dissemination of misinformation to the adversary Party about the intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender, or about an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, as well as feigning civilian, non-combatant or protected status (e.g. of a United Nations employee or of a member of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, by using respective emblems, signs, signals or uniforms, see Art. 23(f) HR and Art. 37(1) AP I). The aforementioned misinformation can generally be transmitted by the means of the Internet, for example by e-mail or as a statement on a website. As already stated (e.g. supra II.2.), the “cyber-identity” of the aforementioned protected persons can easily be feigned in the “cyberspace”. However, the above described dissemination of misinformation or feigning of the (cyber) identity of a protected person is prohibited only if it directly results in the death, injury or capture of the adversary.\nConversely, legal ruses of war in the sense of Article 24 HR and Article 37(2) AP I, which are merely aimed to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly, offer a broad field of application to CNO. Thus, it is imaginable that a Party to an armed conflict establishes a so-called honey net around its own computer network, i.e. an outside-network building a buffer around its own computer network, which is only minimally protected against hacking and, technically speaking,\n The specific nexus between the dissemination of misinformation or feigning of a protected status on the one hand and the death, injury or capture of the adversary on the other hand is required in order to establish accountability of armed forces, as – in the traditional understanding of warfare – all military actions always pursue death, injury or capture of the adversary, see M. Bothe, K.J. Partsch &amp; W.A. Solf, *New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts. Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949* (The Hague / Boston / London, Martinus Nijhoff, 1982), Art. 37 (1) AP I, no. 2.4, p. 204.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nappears perfectly realistic, but contains false information, for example on planned military operations or on the status of own forces and their location. Such a honey net could be established specifically in the hope that the adversary Party would compromise it and – in this way – obtain false information.\n## ii. Methods or Means of Warfare Prohibited Because of the Nature of Their Effects\nSome methods or means of warfare are prohibited because of the nature of their effects.\nAccording to Article 51(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. This ban refers to the dissemination of certain information to the civilian population. As this information could be easily transmitted by means of computer-based information systems, for example via e-mail or as information on a website, this prohibition must be considered during the planning and the conduct of CNO.\nFurthermore, Article 23(e) HR, Article 35(2) AP I, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980 and its Protocols as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 prohibit the employment of methods or means of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Equally, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57(2)(a)(iii) AP I stipulate that an attack which may be expected to cause loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. As it is perfectly possible that a cyber attack could indirectly cause physical damage (see supra II.1.C), it must be examined beforehand whether the anticipated (indirect) effect would be excessive in the sense of the above-mentioned provisions. In this regard, as the expected effects of concrete CNO\n Those are: Protocol on Non-Detectable Fragments (Protocol I) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III) of 1980, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV) of 1995, and Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V) of 2003.\n See E.T. Jensen, ‘Unexpected Consequences from Knock-Out Effects: A Different\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nare to be assessed, the practical criteria for the examination resemble to ones for the analysis of the effects caused by other (e.g. conventional) weapons.\nMoreover, according to Article 51(4) AP I indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Attacks are deemed to be indiscriminate, when they are not or cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or when their effects cannot be limited (see Art. 51(4)(a)-(c) AP I). It is perfectly possible that CNO equated to an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello) or an “act of violence” (see III.1.B.) could have indiscriminate effects, in the case of global, uncontrolled spreading of viruses, bugs and – in future – micro-mechanical organisms via the Internet. However, damaging software could be programmed in such a way so as to only target computer systems with specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. An uncontrolled spread of malware, as well as any cascade effects, could be easily prevented by appropriate programming.\nHowever, the vast majority of malicious CNO will not achieve the quality of a “method or means of combat, the effects of which are indiscriminate”. The inductive conclusion drawn from the examples given by Articles 51(4)(a) and (b) AP I shows that the provisions refer to methods or means of combat which result in physically “devastating” physical effects.\nFinally, Article 35(3) in connection with Article 55(1) AP I prohibits the employment of methods or means of warfare which may be expected to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. This provision covers only especially extensive, intensive and long-lasting environmental damage, which exceeds the scale of both the quality and quantity of “ordinary” environmental damage which is expected to occur in the course of combat.[108] Severe damage of the natural environment can always be caused when dangerous forces are set free, such as by radiation escaping from a nuclear power plant, the explosion of a chemical or pharmacy installation, or the breaking of a dam or dyke. As such effects could be caused indirectly by CNO\nStandard for Computer Network Operations?', Vol. 18 American University LL.Rev. 2003, pp. 1178 et seq.; and Schmitt, supra note 28, p. 82.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(see supra II.1.C), the prohibition of Article 35(3) AP I must be also considered for operations primarily conducted within “cyberspace”.\n## B. Prohibited Targets\nFurthermore, LOAC provisions granting protection for non-combatants and for civilian objects are of significance for CNO.\n### i. Civilians Population and Individual Civilians\nThe civilian population as a whole, as well as individual civilians (see Art. 50 AP I), are protected against “attacks”, “acts of violence” and “effects of hostilities”. Accordingly, CNO which are not deemed as being “use of force”, and thus not comprising an “attack” (in the meaning of *ius in bello*), “act of violence” or “effect of hostilities” (see supra III.1.B) would not be contrary to LOAC and – from the perspective of international humanitarian law – could legally be directed against civilians.\nConversely, CNO considered as being a “use of force” could only be directed against civilians launching malicious CNO against the armed forces constituting “direct participation in hostilities” within the meaning of Article 51(3) AP I and Article 13(3) AP II. In order to distinguish between private hacking as “direct participation in hostilities” and hacking as a mere criminal act, all circumstances of a specific case must be taken into consideration (see also supra II.2).\nFurthermore, according to Article 48 AP I, the Parties to an armed conflict must, at all times, distinguish between the civilian population\n See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52(1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Art. 13(2) AP II.\n See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n Concurring: Schmitt, supra note 106, p. 378.\n The examination of the different approaches to the question of the direct participation of civilians in hostilities, and especially of the temporal scope of the loss of protection otherwise granted by international humanitarian law, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further examination, the following literature may be recommended selectively: N. Melzer, *Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities* (Geneva, ICRC, May 2009), available at www.icrc.org; Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 51 AP I, no. 2.4.2.2., p. 303; M.N. Schmitt, ‘Direct Participation in Hostilities and 21st Century Armed Conflict’, in H. Fischer, U. Froissart, W.H. von Heinegg &amp; C. Raap (Hrsg.), *Krisensicherung und humanitärer Schutz – Crisis Management and Humanitarian Protection. Festschrift für Dieter Fleck* (Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), pp. 505–529.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nand combatants. Admittedly, the conventional (visual) criteria for the identification of a combatant as set out in Articles 43 and 44 AP I are not helpful for CNO, during which the acting individuals are not physically visible. However, the obligation to distinguish can also be met within “cyberspace”. In the “virtual world”, a computer of a combatant can be distinguished from the computer of a non-combatant according to its IP address and other technical data automatically sent during an Internet session. It can easily be verified by everybody in one of the official WhoIs? Internet databases to which person or entity a specific IP address or an IP address range is assigned. In addition, the “owner” and the responsible administrators of websites can be found in the WhoIs? databases. Thus, in principle it can be confirmed whether a particular actor in the “virtual world” should be considered as a member of the armed forces or as a civilian.\nNevertheless, some challenges as to the identification of a person acting in the “cyberspace” as a combatant will remain. For example, a member of regular armed forces and thus a combatant will not be recognizable as such when using his private computer at home, the latter sending during an Internet session information identifying the user as a civilian. This resembles the “real world” situation, when a soldier is not wearing the uniform when being at home and thus cannot visually be identified as a combatant as well. Thus, the remaining challenges are not new and will mostly resemble similar “real world” cases.\n## ii. Civilian Objects\nAccording to Article 48 AP I, civilian objects must be distinguished from military objectives. Civilian objects must not be the objects of attack or reprisals (Articles 48, 52(1)-(2) and 57 AP I, see also Art. 23(g) HR and further specific regulations in Articles 53–56 AP I and Articles 14–16 AP II). Generally, this principle of distinction, as well as the above-mentioned prohibitions, can also be observed within the “virtual world”.\n See the profound examination by S. Watts, ‘Combatant Status and Computer Network Attack’, Vol. 50 No. 2 Virginia J.I.L. 2010, pp. 391–447.\n The WhoIs? databases of the RIRs (see supra note 58) provide information on which IP address is assigned to which end customer (in the case of dynamic IP-addresses: to which Internet Service Provider). Thus, the database DENIC (available at http://www.denic.de) provides respective information on “.de” domains, and the database RIPE (available at http://www.ripe.net) on the other domains in Europe, InterNIC (available at http://www.internic.net/whois.html) on the domains “com”, “edu”, “int”, “net” or “org”. The database Network Information Center (available at http://www.nic.com) leads to official and regional WhoIs? databases as well as to respective private databases available online.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nViruses, bugs and – in the future – micro-mechanical organisms can be programmed in such a way that they only affect military computer networks, namely those with corresponding IP addresses or IP address ranges. The identification of a computer or computer system as military or civilian can be made by a search request of a specific IP address in one of the Whols? databases (see supra III.2.B.i).\nMalicious CNO against a purely military computer network, such as the Intranet or other communication systems of armed forces supported by the Intranet, would be perfectly legal in regard to LOAC. CNO launched against civilian computer networks – in case they are not to be considered as military objectives pursuant to Article 52(2) AP I – would only be allowed when they are not to be considered as an “attack” in the sense of Article 49(1) AP I, i.e. would not cause any physical damage (see supra III.1.B). A mere suppression or denial of access of the civilian population to a computer network or to specific data as well as the mere manipulation or the deletion of particular data would not fall under the prohibition of attack, as long as physical damage in- or outside the directly affected networks is not caused. For example, the deletion of a particular electronically operated bank account of a civilian would not be forbidden as a matter of LOAC.\nDistinction between civilian objects and military objectives becomes difficult when a computer network is used by both combatants and non-combatants (so-called dual use objects). This applies especially to the global Internet where, apart from the civilian population, there is a high probability that it will also be used by Parties to an armed conflict for the purposes of communication and information gathering. According to some scholars, the Internet is to be deemed as a military objective as soon as it is also used for military purposes.[116] Considering that nowadays the Internet is as an equally important means of communication as telephone and telegraph connections were in the past, the aforementioned opinion is supported by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had already in 1956 classified the latter as military objectives.[117]\n[116] This assertion is made in general terms, referring to communication networks used for both military and civilian purposes by Jensen, supra note 105, pp. 1160 et seq.; J.P. Terry, ‘The Lawfulness of Attacking Computer Networks in Armed Conflict and in Self-Defense in Period Short of Armed Conflict: What are the Targeting Constrains?’, Vol. 169 Mil. L. Rev. 2001, p. 85; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 35. Similarly: Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, no. 2.4.2., p. 324.\n[117] Annex Military Targets to the Draft Rules for the Limitation of Dangers Incurred\n\nHowever, some scholars refuse to classify civilian means of communication merely co-used for military purposes as a military objective. Indeed, in order to avoid any “automatism”, a thorough examination of the definition of a military objective provided by Article 52(2) AP I will be necessary. The definition clearly refers to objects only. Thus, at first sight, it seems doubtful whether the “virtual world” of the Internet can be deemed to be an object. However, the computer system Internet is not a purely intellectual construction. It comprises a multitude of objects, including technical equipment as servers, cables, cross points and access points; thus, the provision is in general applicable to the Internet. According to this definition, the computer system Internet or any other (dual use) computer network is to be considered as a military objective, if\n- the computer network makes an effective contribution to military action by its use, and\n- the total or partial destruction or neutralization of the computer network offered a definite (i.e. concrete and perceptible) military advantage (in regard to the overall military operation).\nWhether the Internet meets these conditions depends on the degree to which the other Party to the armed conflict uses the Internet, and whether this Party can easily revert to alternative communication means. Therefore, the characterisation of the Internet, or other dual use computer networks, as a military objective depends on the circumstances of the specific situation, especially on the degree of the dependence of the adversary Party on those networks, *ergo* on the level of the technologisation of the adversary armed forces.\nEven if the Internet was to be considered to be a military objective in the context of a particular armed conflict, it must be considered that it would be allowed to be attacked only as far as its physical elements\nby the Civilian Population in Time of War, see Fleck, supra note 66, § 443. von Heinegg, supra note 77, pp. 150 seq.\n The examination, whether the “contribution” shall have a particular significance for or shall merely support a certain military operation, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further details see Fleck, supra note 66, § 442; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.3., p. 324.\n See R. Wedgwood, ‘Proportionality, Cyberwar and the Law of War’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 225; and von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 150.\n Wedgwood, supra note 120, p. 225; Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 149; Fleck, supra note 66, § 444; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.4. See also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) of the ICC Statute.\n\n(e.g. server, cross points and WLAN access points) are located on the territory of one of the Parties to the particular armed conflict. But, even if such an attack was conducted successfully, a connection to the Internet could still be made from the same geographical area, for example via a mobile phone or other device enabled with respective software permitting Internet connectivity. Thus, an attack against the Internet intending the *quasi* disabling of a network within the area of conflict is unlikely to succeed.\n### iii. Objects under Special Protection\nAdditionally, LOAC provides special protection against attacks and reprisals for specific civilian objects. Corresponding prohibitions can be found in Article 27 HR, Articles 19-21 GC I., Articles 22 and 24 GC II., Articles 18 *et seq.* GC IV, Article 4 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954 and in its Protocol I of 1954 and Protocol II of 1999, Articles 12, 21, 24 *et seq.*, 54(2) and (4) and 56 AP I as well as in Articles 11 and 14–16 AP II. Pursuant to these provisions, special protection is provided for dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (*inter alia* drinking water installations and water irrigation works), medical units and transportation, historic monuments, works of art or places of worship etc. As far as incorporating computer-based elements, the above-mentioned objects could be disrupted or even destroyed by the means of a cyber attack. Therefore, the computer-based cooling system of a nuclear power plant, for example, must not be disabled by remote control, a drinking water installation must not be destroyed by a computer controlled opening and closing of its valves, a medical aircraft must not be caused to crash by manipulation of data of an air traffic control system, or a museum protected by *ius in bello* must not be flooded by the remote activation of a water sprinkler system.\n In general terms, a *Wireless Local Area Network* (WLAN) describes a local wireless and direct connection between two or more mobile end devices (*clients*), which are equipped with a wireless access device. Usually, *clients* access the Internet via a central bridge (so-called *access point*). The bridge has a *router*, which – based on a *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol* (DHPC server) – assigns a dynamic IP address to each *host* (see also *supra* note 58) seeking connectivity to the Internet.\n In order to disable the Internet, all its thirteen *root servers* (i.e. the main *domain name servers* or the main server layer of the internet) would have to be disconnected or destroyed. For security reasons, those servers are located in different, secret sites which are geographically distant. It is asserted that disabling up to ten of the *root servers* would probably merely delay the data transfer via the Internet.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nGenerally speaking, the aforementioned provisions, which provide special protection for specific civilian objects, can cease in the event that the objects are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy or for regular, significant and direct support for military operations of the enemy. In general terms, an active counter-CNO (back-hacking) could be legally launched once a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit to stop the forbidden activities, and after such warning has remained unheeded. For example, in the case of the computer network of a medical unit, if it had been identified as the location of origin of malicious CNO, as an exception, an active counter-CNO could be launched if a warning about the forthcoming back-hacking had been given in advance, for instance in the form of a pop-up window which would appear on the computer screen of the cyber attacker.\nIt should also be considered that as far as an attack against an object is forbidden, the enemy must not be led to attack such objects. Therefore, CNO which would correspondingly manipulate a targeting database of the adversary Party to the armed conflict in order to assign the data of the geographical coordinates of a civilian object under special protection to the data of a military objective of the adversary Party would be forbidden. As an example, when manipulating the adversary's targeting database, a munitions factory must not be assigned the geographical coordinates of a hospital.\n## 3. The Law of Neutrality and the Cyberspace\nFirst of all, neutrality in the sense of *ius in bellum* has to be distinguished from permanent neutrality (e.g. the cases of Austria, the Holy See, and Switzerland), i.e. the legal obligation undertaken in peacetime to remain neutral in cases of armed conflict or war between other States, and from the mere neutrality policy (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Ireland), which, nonetheless, can have some legally binding effects due to the situation of confidence created in which other States may rely on the (political) declarations to remain neutral (principle of estoppel).\n## A. The Applicability of the Law of Neutrality\nNeutrality is a particular status of a State not Party to an armed conflict of significant scope or – according to a traditional view – to a “war\n Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1105.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin the legal sense” between other States. Although it is not crucial for the purposes of the present survey to decide which view is to be followed, it may be mentioned that the International Court of Justice stated in its Advisory Opinion on the *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* of 8 July 1996 that “[...] the principle of neutrality [...] is applicable [...], to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used”. However, it must always be taken into consideration that in particular cases the rules governing neutrality may be modified by collective self-defence provisions such as Article 51 UN Charter and Article 5 North Atlantic Treaty (depriving a State of the possibility to legally join an armed conflict or a war on the side of the aggressor) and by (binding) decisions taken by the UN Security Council (see Articles 2(5) and 25 and Chapter VII UN Charter; the obligation to assist any action taken by the UN in accordance with the Charter would forestall a State to appeal to its neutrality).\nIn the following it will be shown that the rules on neutrality – which are over 100 years old – apply to military operations conducted in cyberspace (during an armed conflict of significant scope or a “war in the legal sense”). When examining the law of neutrality, no difference will be made between the specific rules applying to land, air or sea warfare, as the distinction between these areas is not relevant to CNO.\n## B. Prohibition of CNO Causing Physical Damage\nFirst and foremost, the rules of neutrality protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the neutral State, see Article 1 Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907 (HC V) and Art. 1 Hague Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 1907 (HC XIII).\nThus, the principle of neutrality prohibits causing physical damage on the sovereign territory of a neutral State. Consequently, a malicious\n The discussion of the question, whether rules on neutrality apply in situations of war (in legal sense) only or also in situations of an armed conflict of significant scope, would exceed the scope of the present survey. Interested readers may be referred to the assessment in Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1106.\n ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90 (emphasis by the author).\n See further details at Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1103; and G. Walker, ‘Information Warfare and Neutrality’, Vol. 33 *Vanderbilt J. Transnational L.* 2000, pp. 1079 et seq.\n ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90. Regarding the necessary criteria of a “physical encroachment”\n\nCNO would only breach the principle of the territorial inviolability of a neutral State if it – indirectly – caused physical damage (deaths, injuries or destruction of property) on the territory of a neutral State or medium to long-term disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a neutral State (see supra III.1.A.vi). In this regard, the physical damage could refer to physical components (technical equipment) of the Internet and/or other computer systems as well as to objects/living beings outside the affected computer systems.\nIn regard to critical infrastructure systems, it must always be considered that they can be shared by several States (e.g. an electricity distribution system is shared between Laos and Thailand, between Venezuela and Brazil, between Canada and the United States and between Indonesia and Singapore; one telecommunication system is shared by several States in East and South-East Asia).[129] Thus, before targeting a critical infrastructure system of the adversary it must always be examined (in addition to other LOAC provisions relevant to targeting) whether the estimated damage could also automatically affect another State neutral to the particular armed conflict or war.\n# C. The Use of Telecommunication Means Belonging to a Neutral State\nAccording to Article 8 HC V, a neutral State can allow the belligerents to use \"telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals\". The neutral State also has the right to restrict or prohibit the use of such communication means, if applied (by the State, companies or individuals) impartially to all belligerents (see Article 9 HC V and 9(1) HC XIII).\nIn regard to the Internet, such a restriction or prohibition could be enforced by a neutral State by applying certain software to all Internet cross points located on its territory. The software would scan the Internet traffic for data packages sent by the belligerents and delete them. Of course, a neutral State could also disable all technical components supporting the worldwide network Internet and located on its territory. This way, the belligerents would not use the Internet components located on the territory of the neutral State, although the Internet system as such would continue to function and could be further used by the Parties to the armed conflict or war.\nsee Greenberg, Goodman &amp; Soo Hoo, supra note 75, p. 10.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nIn the case one Party of the armed conflict or war used the computer network located on the territory of a neutral State to send malicious CNO to the computer systems of the other belligerent – either by launching malicious CNO from neutral State’s territory or by using Internet cross points or other technical equipment located on its territory –, the neutral State would have the right to “protect” its neutral status by taking appropriate actions (e.g. back-hacking). If it failed to do so, the neutral State would have – pursuant to the principle of non-discrimination of belligerents – the obligation to allow the affected belligerent to take action against the malicious CNO.^[130]^\n## D. Data Streams Passing the Territory of a Neutral State\nHowever, it is perfectly possible, even likely, that in the course of the conduct of CNO the data stream carrying malicious components (e.g. viruses or worms) to the adversary’s computer systems passes Internet crossing points and servers located on the territory of a neutral State. However, this would not result in violation of neutrality law.\nFirst of all, a Party to a conflict cannot influence whether a data stream crosses the technical components of the Internet situated on the territory of a neutral State or not. Every data stream sent via the Internet is divided in data packages, each one of which takes – out of millions possible routs – a certain route from cross point to cross point around the globe. The respective choices are done automatically by the Internet system (depending on the traffic load on the routes) and cannot be foreseen or influenced.^[131]^\nFurthermore, according to Article 3(a) HC V and Article 5 HC XIII, a Party to an armed conflict or war is only forbidden to “[e]rect on the territory [including territorial waters] of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea”, and pursuant to Article 3(b) HC V to “[u]se any installation of this kind established by them [i.e. belligerents] before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages”. This means that belligerents are allowed to use all non-purely military means of communication erected or established on the territory of a neutral State – by whomever – before the armed conflict or war. This would apply to all technical installations on the territory of\n^[130]^ Jensen, *supra* note 105, pp. 238 et seq.\n^[131]^ Walker, *supra* note 127, pp. 1079 et seq.\n\nthe neutral State being part of the worldwide, already existing computer network Internet, as it is – also historically – a communication means used by civilians also. It is asserted within academic writings that the establishment of a connection to the Internet as such should be deemed as similar to the forbidden “erecting” of a “communication apparatus”. However, it is more convincing to compare the establishment of a connection to the Internet to connecting to the worldwide telephone system by dialling a phone number – which would surely not be considered as forbidden “erecting” a “communication apparatus” by a belligerent.\nFinally, it must be endorsed that, because the law of neutrality does provide special provisions referring to communication systems on land or in territorial waters (Art. 3 HC V and Art. 5 HC XIII), there is no need or space for an (analogous) application of rules relating to the innocent passage through territorial waters, as asserted in some scholar writings.\n## IV. Concluding Remarks\nGiven the developments in technology and reliance on computer systems, in the future, CNO are likely to be of considerable significance for the planning and conduct of military operations. One of the reasons is that both the equipment and the conduct of CNO are extremely inexpensive when compared to conventional military operations. In addition, CNO can be conducted by only a few experts and from any location distant from the (traditional) area of combat, which safeguards the physical protection of the members of armed forces involved. Furthermore, as mentioned above, within the context of so-called asymmetric warfare, CNO can be a powerful weapon in the hands of non-state actors against the technologically highly developed armed forces of post-industrial States sensitive to malfunctions of their computer networks.\nOwing to the potential physical effects of CNO, the Parties to any future armed conflict in which CNO will be carried out, either in support of conventional military abilities or as the only method of war fighting conducted, will have to observe relevant LOAC provisions. The spirit and purpose of these protection granting rules, as well as the values they reflect, are timeless. They offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n *Id.*\n Such an assertion is made by Walker, *supra* note 127.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nNeither a lack of regulation nor a need for amendment of “aged” norms can be identified, when a teleological interpretation of the provisions is applied.\nThe future practice of the armed forces will show whether adjustments in the interpretation of relevant LOAC provisions will have to be made. The practice of the international community will decide, whether in the future it will be considered necessary to increase the level of the humanitarian protection during armed conflicts, and thus to include protection e.g. of data contained in computers or computer networks of non-combatants. Unquestionably, lawyers advising armed forces will have ever more to deal with corresponding questions of law and to understand the technical details of CNO as an emerging weapon, means or method of war.\n\n## Summary – Résumé – Samenvatting – Zusammenfassung – Riassunto – Resumen\n## Summary – Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nThe Internet has become the most essential means of communication and information. This results in a high dependency upon reliable operations of Internet based communication systems, especially those supporting critical infrastructure systems. Given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to security, the vulnerability of computer systems has become a significant matter of (national or collective) security to many States as well as to NATO. The potential conduct of “Computer Network Operations” (CNO), i.e. military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks, presents some legal challenges. This survey first examines the nature of CNO and discusses the difficulties of identification of the origin and of attribution of a malicious action carried out via or in the cyberspace to a certain actor. After the presentation of some criteria for the qualification of CNO as “use of armed force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning), the survey argues that the Laws of Armed Conflict, including the over hundred years old principles and provisions of neutrality, do apply to CNO. At the same time, it demonstrates that the provisions offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n## Résumé – Les Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques et le Droit des Confits Armés\nL’internet est devenu un moyen de communication et d’information indispensable. Il en résulte une grande dépendance envers la fiabilité du fonctionnement des systèmes de communication basé sur l’internet, particulièrement ceux au soutien d’infrastructures critiques. Étant donné les insuffisances de l’internet en matière de sécurité, la vulnérabilité des systèmes d’ordinateurs est devenue un sujet important pour la sécurité (nationale et collective) de plusieurs États ainsi que pour l’OTAN. La conduite éventuelle d’Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques (OCRI), à savoir des actions militaires offensives ou défensives prises grâce aux moyens mêmes de l’internet ou de réseaux d’ordinateurs, présente quelques défis juridiques. Cet article examine d’abord la nature des OCRI et discute des difficultés associées à l’identification de l’origine et de l’attribution à un acteur précis d’une action malicieuse\n\nexécutée à travers ou au sein du cyber espace. Après avoir présenté quelques critères pour qualifier les OCRI comme étant une utilisation de la force armée (au sens *ius in bello*) l'auteur soutient ensuite que le droit des conflits armés ainsi que les principes et dispositions plus que centenaire en matière de neutralité s'appliquent aux OCRI. Par la même occasion, l'article démontre que ces dispositions offrent un niveau de protection humanitaire qui est comparable à celui en vigueur pour l'utilisation des armes classiques.\n## Samenvatting – Computer netwerk operaties en het humanitair oorlogsrecht\nHet Internet is uitgegroeid tot het belangrijkste communicatie- en informatiemiddel. Dit heeft geleid tot een grote afhankelijkheid van op Internet gebaseerde communicatiesystemen, vooral van die systemen die kritische infrastructuur ondersteunen. Door de beperkingen van het Internet op het gebied van beveiliging, is de kwetsbaarheid van computersystemen een zaak van (nationale of collectieve) veiligheid geworden voor veel staten en voor de NAVO. Computer netwerk operaties (CNO), dat wil zeggen defensieve of offensieve militaire handelingen door middel van Internet of andere computernetwerken, roept juridische vragen op. Dit artikel onderzoekt eerst wat CNO is en bespreekt de moeilijkheden rond het identificeren van de bron van en toerekening aan een bepaalde actor van een vijandige handeling die in of via cyberspace wordt uitgevoerd. Nadat een aantal criteria voor de kwalificatie van CNO als geweldgebruik (in de zin van het *ius in bello*) zijn geponeerd, beargumenteert het artikel dat het humanitair oorlogsrecht, waaronder de principes en regels betreffende neutraliteit die meer dan honderd jaar oud zijn, zich lenen voor toepassing op CNO. Aangetoond wordt dat de bepalingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht binnen dit domein een niveau van bescherming bieden dat vergelijkbaar is met het niveau dat van toepassing is op het gebruik van conventionele wapens.\n## Zusammenfassung – Computernetwerkoperationen und das humanitäre Völkerrecht\nDas Internet wurde zu einem essentiellen Kommunikations- und Informationsmittel unserer Zeit. Dies führte zu einer hochgradigen Abhängigkeit von der Funktionsfähigkeit der auf dem Internet basierenden Kommunikationssysteme. Dies gilt insbesondere für diejenigen Systeme, die kritische Infrastruktursysteme eines Staates\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nunterstützen. Da das Internet in Bezug auf die Sicherheit Mängel aufweist, wurde die Integrität von Computersystemen für manche Staaten so wie auch für die NATO zu einer Frage der (nationalen bzw. kollektiven) Sicherheit. Das potenzielle Durchführen von Computernetzwerkoperationen (CNO), d.h. defensiven oder offensiven Handlungen der Streitkräfte unter Inanspruchnahme des Internet oder anderer Computernetzwerke, bietet einige Herausforderungen rechtlicher Art. In dem vorliegenden Artikel wird zunächst die Natur von CNO dargelegt. Ferner werden die Schwierigkeiten in Bezug auf die Identifizierung des Ursprungs und die Zurechnung einer im virtuellen Raum vorgenommenen schädigenden Handlung zu einem bestimmten Akteur erörtert. Nachdem einige Kriterien für die Einordnung von CNO als „Anwendung bewaffneter Gewalt“ (im Sinne des *ius in bello*) vorgestellt werden, wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht, einschließlich der über hundert Jahre alten Prinzipien und Regelungen des Neutralitätsrechts, auf CNO anwendbar ist. Zugleich wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht hierbei einen humanitären Schutzstandard bietet, der demjenigen gleicht, der bei der Anwendung konventioneller Waffen gilt.\n## Riassunto – Computer Network Operations e il diritto dei conflitti armati\nLa rete internet è divenuta il più importante mezzo di comunicazione ed informazione dell’era contemporanea. Ciò determina una sostanziale dipendenza dal corretto funzionamento dei sistemi di comunicazione basati su tale rete, specialmente per ciò che concerne quelli di sostegno ad infrastrutture critiche. Vista la scarsa sicurezza della comunicazione via internet, la vulnerabilità dei sistemi informatici è diventata una questione di rilievo per la sicurezza (nazionale o collettiva) di molti stati e per la NATO. La potenziale condotta di ‘Operazioni militari su reti informatiche’ (*Computer Network Operations – CNO*), ovvero operazioni militari difensive o offensive scatenate tramite internet o per altra via informatica, presenta tuttavia talune incertezze dal punto di vista giuridico. Dapprima questo articolo esamina la vera natura delle CNO, mettendo in luce le difficoltà di identificazione e attribuzione di un’azione delittuosa portata avanti nello spazio cibernetico (o mediante quest’ultimo), a danno di un determinato soggetto. Successivamente, dopo aver presentato alcuni criteri guida per una corretta qualificazione delle CNO come un vero e proprio “uso della forza armata” (secondo lo *ius in bello*), l’articolo dimostra che il diritto dei conflitti armati, assieme agli ultra-centenari principi e norme sulla neutralità, trova applicazione\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin caso di CNO. Allo stesso modo, lo scritto evidenzia come tali norme offrano un livello di protezione umanitaria comparabile con quello applicabile nel caso di uso di armi convenzionali.\n## Resumen – Operaciones a través de la red informática y Derecho de los Conflictos Armados.\nInternet ha acabado por convertirse en un importante medio de comunicación e información de la era contemporánea. Esto lleva consigo un alto grado de dependencia con respecto a los sistemas de comunicación centrados en la red, especialmente por lo que se refiere a los sistemas que sirven de apoyo a infraestructuras vitales. Vista la escasa seguridad de las comunicaciones a través de internet, la vulnerabilidad de los sistemas de información se ha convertido en una cuestión prioritaria para la seguridad (nacional y colectiva) de muchos Estados así como para la OTAN. Las conductas potenciales que pueden ser objeto de las operaciones a través de la red informática (Computer Network Operations – CNO), como por ejemplo acciones militares tanto ofensivas como defensivas llevadas a cabo a través de internet o de otras redes de información, presentan aspectos interesantes desde el punto de vista jurídico. El presente artículo examina en primer lugar la naturaleza de las CNO y analiza las dificultades que existen para identificar el sistema en el que tiene su origen un ataque y la posterior atribución de una conducta delictiva llevada a cabo en el espacio cibernético (o a través de este último) a un sujeto determinado. Tras la exposición de algunos criterios que permiten calificar las CNO como “uso de fuerza armada” (en el sentido del *ius in bello*), el artículo demuestra que el Derecho de los Conflictos Armados resulta de aplicación a las CNO, incluidos los principios y preceptos ultra-centenarios relativos a la neutralidad. Al mismo tiempo, pone de manifiesto cómo ese Derecho ofrece un nivel de protección humanitaria comparable con el que es de aplicación en el campo del uso de armas convencionales.",

In order to ensure NATO’s permanent and unfettered access to cyberspace and integrity of its critical systems, we will take into account the cyber dimension of modern conflicts in NATO’s doctrine and improve its capabilities to detect, assess, prevent, defend and recover in case of a cyber attack against systems of critical importance to the Alliance. We will strive in particular to accelerate NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) to Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2012 and the bringing of all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection. We will use NATO’s defence planning processes in order to promote the development of Allies’ cyber defence capabilities, to assist individual Allies upon request, and to optimize information sharing, collaboration and interoperability. To address the security risks emanating from cyberspace, we will work closely with other actors, such as the UN and the EU, as agreed. We have tasked the Council to develop, drawing notably on existing international structures and on the basis of a review of our current policy, a NATO in-depth cyber defence policy by June 2011 and to prepare an action plan for its implementation”; available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_68828.htm.",

The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only.

Introduction\nIn this day and age, the Internet is one of the most important means of communication and information. During the last 30 years it has gradually become an essential aspect of the economy in a globalized world and plays an indispensable role in, amongst other things, the administrative and judicial systems of technologically developed countries. All in all, critical infrastructure systems in States with high levels of technology dependency are acutely reliant upon reliable and effective operations of Internet based communication systems. Thus, given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to the security, protection and defence of the integrity of computer networks, the vulnerability of these communication systems has become a significant matter of national security to many such States. Accordingly, the current National Security Strategies of the USA, of the United Kingdom,\n The Internet is globally administered by a Californian (US) non-profit, public-benefit corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which, in the framework of a Public Private Partnership, is associated with and reports to the US Department of Commerce (although, according to the information on ICANN’s website, the organisation heavily emphasises its international nature and independence). ICANN bears global responsibility for ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet as well as for coordinating the Internet system of unique identifiers, i.e. for the assignment of IP-address ranges (since 2005 not directly to users but to regional organisations – see infra note 58). It is further responsible for the generic codes and country codes of the Internet top level domain as well as for the management and maintenance of the (secret) Internet root server system (see infra note 122). ICANN is the successor organization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which was executing the above-mentioned tasks directly on behalf of the US Department of Commerce (information available at http://www.icann/org/en/factsheets/factsheet.html; unless indicated otherwise, all URLs cited in the present survey were last visited on 31 November 2010). Originally, it was planned to transform ICANN into an independent organization in October 2006. During the 2nd World Summit on the Information Society, organized by the UN in Tunis in November 2005, it was proposed to submit ICANN (and thus the Internet itself) to management by the UN. The USA rejected this proposal and declared its intent to keep the control over ICANN for the time being (information available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/).\n The President of the United States of America, National Security Strategy (May 2010), p. 27 et seq., available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf.\n Her Majesty’s Government, A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The National Security Strategy (October 2010), pp. 11 and 27, available at http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191639.pdf?CID=PDF&amp;PLA=furl&amp;CRE=nationalsecuritystrategy.\n\nand Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defence White Paper, all seek to address the issue of cyber-attacks. According to NATO’s new Strategic Concept of 19 November 2010, cyber threats are one of the major perils for the security of the Alliance in the future decade. Similar concerns are reflected in resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly over the last ten years, which regularly mention the integrity of information and communication technology in the context of international security and call for the creation of a global “culture of cyber security”. Additionally, the emerging threat of the use of\n Federal Ministry of Defence, White Paper 2006 on German Security Policy and the Future of the Bundeswehr (2006), p. 17: “Germany’s political and economic structures as well as its critical infrastructure have become more vulnerable as a result, not least where criminal activities, terrorist acts, or military attacks from or on cyberspace are concerned”; available at http://www.bmvg.de/fileserving/PortalFiles/C1256EF40036B05B/W26UWAMT995INFODE/W%202006%20eng%20DS.pdf.\n NATO, Strategic Concept For the Defence and Security of The Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Adopted by Heads of State and Government in Lisbon (19 November 2010), §§ 12 and 19, available at http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf. See also NATO, Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon, Lisbon Summit Declaration (20 November 2010), § 40: “Cyber threats are rapidly increasing and evolving in sophistication. In order to ensure NATO’s permanent and unfettered access to cyberspace and integrity of its critical systems, we will take into account the cyber dimension of modern conflicts in NATO’s doctrine and improve its capabilities to detect, assess, prevent, defend and recover in case of a cyber attack against systems of critical importance to the Alliance. We will strive in particular to accelerate NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) to Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2012 and the bringing of all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection. We will use NATO’s defence planning processes in order to promote the development of Allies’ cyber defence capabilities, to assist individual Allies upon request, and to optimize information sharing, collaboration and interoperability. To address the security risks emanating from cyberspace, we will work closely with other actors, such as the UN and the EU, as agreed. We have tasked the Council to develop, drawing notably on existing international structures and on the basis of a review of our current policy, a NATO in-depth cyber defence policy by June 2011 and to prepare an action plan for its implementation”; available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_68828.htm.\n See the resolutions Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, UN Documents A/53/70 of 4 December 1998, A/54/49 of 1 December 1999, A/55/28 of 20 November 2000, A/56/19 of 29 November 2001, A/57/53 of 22 November 2002, A/58/32 of 8 December 2003, A/59/61 of 3 December 2004, A/60/45 of 8 December 2005, A/61/55 of 6 December 2006, and A/62/17 of 5 December 2007. With regard to the creation of a global culture of cyber security, see the resolutions Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information structures,\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nthe Internet for terrorist purposes (cyber terrorism) is currently on the agendas of several international initiatives and programmes.7\nMilitary forces use the Internet for communication purposes and – to a certain extent – as an inherent component of particular weapon systems. Additionally, the Internet offers the possibility for offensive and/or defensive military actions by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. The military term “Computer Network Operations” (CNO) refers, generally speaking, to computer hacking and back-hacking in the context of a military operation.\nWorldwide, military forces are preparing for the fight in cyberspace. It has been alleged that Israeli armed forces have engaged in CNO activities since the early 1990s.8 The USA established a US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in Fort Meade, Maryland on 23 June 2009 (operational as of October 2010) which unified the already existing cyber capabilities of the US National Security Agency and several US military services (Army Forces Cyber Command, 24th US Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command).9 According to media reports, Belgium10, Germany11, South Korea12 (allegedly in reaction to respective North Korean endeavours), and the\nUN Documents A/55/63 of 4 December 2000, A/56/121 of 19 December 2001, A/57/239 of 20 December 2002, and A/58/199 of 23 December 2003.\n\nUnited Kingdom (Government Communications Headquarters) have established similar commands in 2009, while China did so in 2010.\nUndeniably, CNO have become an important weapon, means or method of warfare extending the – traditionally clearly defined – battlefield to the global cyberspace. Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n See C. Clark, ‘StratCom Plows Ahead on Cyber’, Online Defense and Acquisition Journal of 29 June 2009, available at http://www.dodbuzz.com/2009/06/29/stratcom-plows-ahead-on-cyber/.\n T. Branigen, ‘Chinese Army to Target Cyber War Threat’, Guardian online of 22 July 2010, available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/22/chinese-army-cyber-war-department.\n According to some reports, Chinese armed forces built up CNO capabilities already some years ago, see e.g. Northrop Grumman Corporation - Information Systems Sector, Capability of the People’s Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation (Report of 9 October 2009 Prepared for The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), available at http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## II. The Nature and Significance of CNO\nIn the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).\n## 1. Forms and Effects of CNO\nThe concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA).\nThe above-mentioned components of CNO are strongly interrelated. An adversary’s CNA can help one’s own CND when analysed appropriately. A CNE cannot be conducted without CNA, as the information to be gathered by CNE will mostly be protected by firewalls, passwords and other barriers that are erected to prevent an adversarial CNA. Finally, CNA cannot be conducted without CNE, as without information gathering on the targeted network’s architecture and systems the CNA would effectively be conducted blindly.\nWhile the practical value of the taxonomy of CND/CNE/CNA therefore is questionable, it will be presented in more detail below as most academic writings and media reports refer to this classification.\n## A. CND\nCND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\none’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone). The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies, merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA.\n## B. CNE\nAccording to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”. This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage.\nAccording to open source reports, the vast majority of CNO activities conducted during peacetime consist of CNE. For example, already in 2007, the British intelligence service MI5 warned all financial service providers and companies in Great Britain against concerted cyber espionage endeavours by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. In summer 2007, the computer systems of Germany’s Federal Chancellery as well as those of some federal ministries were infected with spyware (i.e. espionage software) reported to have originated from China. According to the Annual Report 2009 of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, computer systems of Germany’s federal and state governments and of private businesses were targeted by hundreds of (successful and/or unsuccessful) CNE. Foreign intelligence\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nservices were likely to be the organizers of, or are involved in, most of these. In the USA, over 100 foreign intelligence services currently endeavour to intrude computer systems located in the country, as the US Deputy Secretary of Defence stated in September 2010. NATO’s computer networks are also subject to constant – and partly successful – CNE.\nThere is no open source information as to the employment of CNE during an armed conflict. However, it can be assumed that CNE is very likely to be used in support of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance.\n## C. CNA\nCNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”. These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks.\nRelatively harmless, data modification in the course of a CNA can modify and deface a website (defacement). This is often conducted by hackers who wish to express their political view (hacktivism). Another widely spread form of CNA is the Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(DDoS-attack), which can cause delays in the data transfer process, the denial of access to computer systems or servers (e.g. the targeted websites or a email service) or result in the (only temporary) disabling of the targeted systems. The particular DDoS-techniques are as diverse as the – partly very effective – countermeasures developed since 2000.\nHowever, the deletion or modification of data in a successfully intruded computer network can be more hazardous. Hackers can generate wrong information, for instance in the military environment the content of electronically transmitted orders, plans and maps or the localization data of military targets contained in a targeting-database.\nMoreover, it is possible that a CNA could – indirectly – cause death, physical injury or physical destruction of property. As far as chemical plants, nuclear power stations, oil refinery installations, gas store installations or electrical power distribution installations have or rely on computer-based control systems, these systems could be penetrated and manipulated. Thus, a CNA could cause the explosion of a nuclear power plant if the cooling systems were disabled via remote control. The same applies to computer-based control systems of transportation systems. By manipulation of the rail points, train derailments or collisions could be caused; penetration and minimal amendments to the programming of an air traffic control system could result in aircraft incidents. Therefore, the classification of CNO as a non-lethal weapon, as asserted by some scholars, has to be challenged in this regard. Also, the general assertion made that CNO, in its current form would generally not violate LOAC, is questionable.\n\nAbove all, CNA can affect the functioning of a State, when manipulating or deleting data in computer systems of critical infrastructure systems. The list of critical infrastructure systems will slightly differ from State to State. By way of example, the following areas identified by the German Federal Office of Security of Information Technology (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) can be considered as critical infrastructure systems: transportation and traffic (postal services, local traffic, roads, rail system, aviation, sea and inland navigation); energy (nuclear plants, distribution and transfer systems of electricity, oil, gas); hazardous substances (chemical and biological agents, nuclear reactors); information and telecommunication technology; finance, currency and insurance (banks, insurance companies, financial service providers, stock markets); public utilities (health, emergency and rescue sector, disaster control, food and water supply, waste management); government, administration, justice, police, customs and armed forces.\nMany of these critical infrastructure systems are based on computer-based control systems, such as the generation and distribution of electricity or telecommunications. Some function entirely on the basis of an Internet connection, including the banking and stock exchange systems. Other areas are increasingly reliant on the Internet, for example the so-called e-justice and e-government. In any technologically highly developed, post-industrial State most of the critical infrastructure systems can be deemed to depend on the operability and efficiency of electronic data transfer. The devastating effects and the subsequent disruption of the ordre public caused by a CNA are limited only by the imagination of the reader. Therefore, cyber security plays a paramount role for the national security of many States and was noted as one of the major perils for the Alliance's security in NATO's Strategic Concept of 2010 (see supra I).\nThere is open source information available in the media on CNA being conducted during peacetime.\nThe only publicly known case, in which the attribution of a CNA to a particular State can be asserted, was the penetration and temporary disabling of Syrian air defence networks, especially the radar systems, by Israel on 6 September 2007, immediately followed by an airstrike by Israel's Air Force destroying Syria's Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Deir-Az-Zur.\n See the list of critical infrastructure systems, available at https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/Publikationen/Faltblaetter/F17KritischeInfrastruktur.html.\n Ben-David, supra note 8.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nA more prominent case of a successful CNA against a State are the DDoS-attacks launched against several critical infrastructure systems in Estonia during the 27 April – 18 May 2007 timeframe. The “attacks” targeted websites and communication channels of the government and commercial services. For example, the web-services of the major banks Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank were (at one-time) interrupted for 1,5 hours; the website of a governing coalition party was defaced; emergency phone numbers were disengaged for a short time; and three major Estonian Internet Service Providers and some online news providers were disconnected (although it is unclear for how long). The estimated physical (because of the disengagement of emergency phone numbers) and economic damage caused by the DDoS-attacks remains unclear. The attacks most probably originated from the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the relatively simple DDoS-methods and the political context of the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, it is asserted that the “attackers” were politically motivated private persons (hacktivism).\nAnother example of successful CNA during peacetime are the defacement and DDoS-attacks launched against Lithuania between 28 June and 1 July 2008. The CNA may have been connected either to the amendment of Lithuania’s laws to prohibit the display of symbols of the Soviet Union or the singing of its anthem in public or to the unilateral veto against discussions on an EU energy partnership deal with Russian Federation. Over 300 Lithuanian websites were defaced, including those of the Government. Given the pro-Russian contents\n\nof the defacement, as well as the subject of the (unsolicited) spam emails “Hackers United against external threats to Russia”, the CNA is assumed to have originated with nationalistic, private hacker groups (hacktivism).42\nOn the contrary, the “Conficker” worm, reported to have been created by Russian criminals, was not aimed at State structures, as it spread worldwide, affecting both private and official networks. It did gain national interest of the victim States, when it began to affect governmental and military computer systems, including those of the British Parliament,43 and the French and British air forces and navies.44\nThe worm “Stuxnet”, which affected over 100.000 computer systems worldwide between June and September 2010, targeted industrial control systems of gas pipelines and power plants based on Siemens software, aiming to establish remote control of the systems and to hide any changes in the computer systems from the operators of the equipment.45 As the vast majority of the infections affected Iran’s critical infrastructure systems, in particular of the nuclear power plant near Bushehr, and the worm’s reach and complexity obviously required enormous personnel and budgetary investments as well as a considerable amount of time to write the code (in secrecy), the involvement of a foreign organization or State is suspected.46\n\nAlthough there is no respective open source information, it must be assumed that, in the past, CNA were also successfully launched against NATO’s computer systems. The *Analysis and Recommendations of the Group of Experts on a New Strategic Concept for NATO* presented on 17 May 2010 noted: “Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern”.\nFurthermore, CNA were conducted during times of armed conflict, as for example during *Operation Allied Force* (24 March – 10 June 1999) launched by 10 NATO Member States against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the beginning of the operation, websites and the mailing system of NATO were blocked and infected by a virus (Melissa), apparently originating in Serbia. Furthermore, some defacement attacks were launched by politically motivated individuals (hacktivism) from Serbia and Russia (*Black Hand, From Russia with Love, Russian Hacker Union*, etc.) against websites of NATO and NATO Member States. Equally, some hackers groups (politically) supporting the NATO operation (e.g. *Dutchthreat* or *Kosovo Hackers Group*) tried to infiltrate the governmental websites of Yugoslavia. Moreover, it is suspected that the President of the USA, *Bill Clinton*, did authorize the *Central Intelligence Agency* (CIA) to penetrate the computer systems of banks in Greece, Lebanon, Russia and Cyprus in order to clear the banking accounts of the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia *Slobodan Milošević*. As the respective plans are said to have been\n‘Foreign-made’ ‘Stuxnet’ Computer Virus’, *The Washington Post* online of 27 September 2010, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092706229.html.\n NATO, *NATO 2020: Assured Security, Dynamic Engagement.

Those were DDoS-attacks and defacements mainly directed against Georgian government websites but also the web portals of Georgia’s National Bank and news agencies, partly resulting in shutting down the website servers for hours or days. Although suspicions of the – officially disclaimed – involvement of the Russian Federation in the cyber incidents remain, these incidences were allegedly attributed to the criminal organization “Russian Business Network” (hosting and renting illegal web services).\nIn regard to the aforementioned armed conflicts, it can be inferred that the conduct of CNO did partly influence the perception of the conflict in the public, but not its overall outcome. It can be assumed that also in the near future CNO are very likely to be used merely in support of a conventional military operation, mainly military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, or in order to influence the perception of a particular political conflict in the online media.\n## 2. Identification of the Origin and Attribution of Malicious CNO\nIt will always be difficult to unequivocally identify the computer systems that malicious CNO originated from and to attribute the attack to a certain entity, group or a State.\nA cyber attack is distinguished by its rapidness. As soon as the attack is completed, the tracing of the data stream (so-called back-tracing) and\nnews.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/352059.stm; ‘CIA Ordered to Topple Milosevic’, BBC News online of 6 July 1999, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/387463. stm; and F.

Markoff, ‘Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks’, The New York Times online of 13 August 2008, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=2&amp;em.\n For more details, see id.\n Id.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nthus the identification of the originating computer system are highly improbable. It is highly unlikely that hackers will leave any tangible evidence, for example in the protocols of the intrusion detection systems of the attacked network, as such evidence in these protocols is easy to delete once the network is penetrated.\nMoreover, and further aggravating the issue, a cyber-attack can be conducted “anonymously”, for example by using one of the (often) free of charge anonymisation services offered on the Internet which would hide the unique characteristics of the hackers’ computer system. These unique characteristics are the so-called IP address as well as other technical data a computer sends while connected to the Internet.\n An IP address (Internet Protocol number) is a twelve digit number, which identifies a computer or another network device during an Internet session. An IP data package is the basic element of data transmission via the Internet. It comprises: a header (containing information on the source, destination, status and fragmentation of the transmitted data) and a payload (containing the transmitted data). At the very beginning of the Internet, the IANA (see supra note 1) assigned static IP addresses, i.e. IP addresses permanently assigned to a particular user, to companies, organizations, universities and also to individuals. The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only. After the particular Internet session the dynamic IP address is assigned to another user and client of the respective Access Provider. At present, the so-called static IP-addresses are only being used for leased Internet-lines of major corporations and other entities.\n These include: Media Access Control address (MAC address) or – for the operating system Apple – the Airport ID of a computer (order of numbers, which clearly identifies a computer hardware); Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, details on the assignment of a MAC address or Airport ID to an IP address); Service Set Identity (SSID, details on the network name); Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol (WEP, coded details about the network); as well as details on the operating system and its adjustments. These details are – if not blocked – automatically transferred during the Internet session to any computer requesting this information by a so-called PING (Packet InterNet Grouper). A PING is computer software sending an ICMP-Echo-Request data package to the destination address of the host which is to be scanned, i.e. to the IP address, to the Domain Name System name (DNS name) or to the Network Basic Input Output System name (NetBIOS name) of the targeted host. The targeted system automatically responds by an ICMP-Echo-Reply, if – according to the usual adjustments of the system – the system supports the ICMP package.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nFurthermore, the Internet offers possibilities for deception in regard to the identity of the hackers' computer systems. It is perfectly possible to feign someone else's IP address and other technical data (so-called malicious misrepresentation or spoofing) and thus to operate in the Internet under someone else's \"cyber-identity\". The connection to the Internet can also be established via a mobile phone or other device with a feigned identity number. Additionally, the data stream can be conducted through the whole globe via a chain of computers of numerous unsuspecting individuals, if so-called zombie software (partly offered free of charge on the Internet) has been secretly installed on the respective computers by using Trojans. One of these computers could subsequently be misused as the sender of the data stream (so-called remote control). Thus, in the case of a cyber attack, even after a back tracing of the malicious data stream, the victim can seldom be sure as of the identification and geographical location of the computer system the attack originated from.\nAbove all, even if a malicious data stream of a cyber attack would indeed be successfully back-traced to the hackers' computer systems, it will – highly probable – remain unproven which individuals of which citizenship and on who's orders were operating the systems identified. Therefore, the attribution of a cyber attack to a certain individual, group, entity or State will most probably be based on unproven suspicions or indications only.\nConsequently, it will be very unlikely to recognize at first sight – and probably even after detailed technical analysis – whether the attack was conducted by a mischievous teenager, by a criminal (including a terrorist), by a group with extremist or terrorist background or by the adversary Party in an armed conflict.\nThese uncertainties will surely add to the complexity of both the legal analysis of a cyber attack and the victim's decision on choosing a subsequent course of action. Considering the difficulty in identifying and locating the hackers' computer systems and – most importantly – attributing the attack, in most cases it will remain in doubt whether national police forces and public prosecutors or, in the framework of international judicial cooperation, the police forces and public prosecutors of a foreign State, or the armed forces (in the case the attack occurs during an already existing armed conflict and is believed to have originated with a party to the armed conflict, or in the case the effects of the cyber-attack are comparable to a conventional armed\n\nattack and trigger the right to self-defence) retain main responsibility to deal with the case.\n## 3. CNO in Modern Warfare\nThe significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations is manifold.\nWhilst most armed conflicts in this day and age are occurring in regions that are technologically less sophisticated (e.g. Afghanistan, Sudan or Chad), this does not result in the irrelevance of the Internet and of CNO. It must be taken into consideration that, in regard to communication abilities and collection of open source information, the parties to armed conflicts in less well developed regions are also essentially dependent on – aside from radio traffic – wireless Internet connectivity, as other communication and information systems (e.g. telecommunication media, print media, telephone lines) are often non-existent.\nIt is especially evident in the context of so-called asymmetric warfare and in the hands of non-state actors, for instance terrorists, that CNO can be a powerful weapon, primarily against post-industrial States and their potent armed forces. More than ever, post-industrial States have technologically highly developed armed forces at their disposal, which correspondingly react most sensitively to technical disorder. It is the dependence on the technology which makes them extremely vulnerable to a cyber attack.\nAs CNO can be conducted from any place in the world by as little as a few experts and, in addition, are extraordinarily inexpensive when compared with conventional military operations, they offer a particularly practical and extremely powerful \"weapon\". Therefore, all aspects of CNO (see supra II.1) show an increasing significance in the context of national as well as of international security.\nAs the Head of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Co-ordination Centre stated already in 2008: \"Cyber war can become a very effective global problem because it is low-risk, low-cost, highly effective and easily globally deployable. It is almost an ideal weapon that nobody can ignore\".60\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## III. Legal Analysis of CNO\nAlthough some scholars plead for a general prohibition of CNO, currently such a ban does not exist. However, many international and domestic legal restrictions do apply to CNO – a fact which makes a legal analysis a complex undertaking.\nApart from the fundamental principle of public international law, namely the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations, a number of specific areas of public international law may apply to CNO. As data packages pass through the territory of several States when sent via the Internet, the provisions of territorial sovereignty must be considered. Also, data manipulations might – under certain circumstances – be judged as intervention in domestic affairs of a State, which would be considered illegal under public international law. Further, because satellite technology is involved, space law and especially treaties relating to satellites must be considered. As CNO can interfere with telecommunication systems and always result in data amendments in the working storage of the attacked computer system, both international telecommunications law and international copyright law (in regard to software) require a thorough analysis. In case human rights treaty law is generally applicable, their respective provisions must be considered, especially in regard to secrecy of correspondence, telecommunications and data protection, as well as to the right to receive and impart information and ideas. Restraints for CNO can further result from the provisions of diplomatic and consular law, whenever diplomatic or consular computer systems are involved. Furthermore, it has been asserted that international environmental law principles of good neighbourhood and of the prevention of significant trans-boundary harm would be applicable to CNO in analogy. In addition, the provisions of\n A. D’Amato pleads for a general prohibition of CNO, emphasizing that the stability of the international community depends on the free flow of information (p. 68) and that every nation has a vital interest in the operationability of the Internet (p. 69), see A. D’Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’, in M.N. Schmitt &amp; B.T. O’Donnell (eds.), *Computer Network Attack and International Law* (Newport / Rhode Island, US Naval War College, 2002), pp. 59–71, pp. 67–69. See also: T. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position. Viewing Information Warfare as Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’, Vol. 30 *Case Western Reserve* J.I.L. 1998, p. 600.\n Such assertion is made – emphasizing that the Internet is a global resource comparable to the natural environment – by T. Stein &amp; T. Marauhn, ‘Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen’, Vol. 60 *Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht* 2000, p. 21. A similar approach\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nrespective national law systems, especially constitutional and criminal law, must always be taken into consideration.\nGiven the variety of areas of law involved and the limited scope of this survey, the following remarks will be restricted to the analysis of LOAC, focusing on the provisions of the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Annex to the Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (HR), the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GC) $^{63}$ and their Additional Protocols I $^{64}$ (AP I) and II $^{65}$ (AP II) (2). However, first of all, it must be examined under which conditions LOAC applies to CNO (1).\n## 1. The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict\nAccording to common Article 2 of the GCs, LOAC applies to\nall cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.\nIn practice, armed conflicts surely can be considered as the main case of application of LOAC. Pursuant to the prevailing opinion an\nis taken by the (non-binding) OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems of 1992, which call for cooperation of States (Principle 6) in the area of comprehensive protection of information systems (Principle 4), and which stipulate an imperative of deliberation in the use of information systems (Principle 3), see OECD Doc. OCDE/GD(92)190. However, an analogous application of international environmental law provisions is not convincing because of the lack of an “unintended omission” or of the absence of regulation. International telecommunication law, in particular the provisions of the (almost universally ratified) Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) of 22 December 1992, binds ITU Member States to far-reaching obligations in regard to the protection of communication and information systems (see in particular Articles 6, 33, 38, 45 and 47 of the ITU Constitution).\n$^{63}$ These are: Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949; Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949; Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\n$^{64}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\n$^{65}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\ninternational armed conflict occurs when one or more States have recourse to “armed force” against another State, regardless of the legality, reasons or the intensity of this confrontation. This opinion is confirmed by the Commentary on the GC which states that “any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2”. Art. 1(4) AP I extends the definition of international armed conflict to include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination. A non-international armed conflict within the meaning of the common Article 3 GCs occurs when one or more non-governmental organized armed groups are involved and the situation reaches a certain threshold of confrontation, distinguishing it from internal disturbances, riots or acts of banditry (see also Art. 1 AP II). Thus, a situation of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and consequently the application of LOAC is given, when States or – under certain circumstances – organized armed groups use “armed force” against the other Party.\nUnsurprisingly, LOAC is applicable to all CNO conducted either in support of conventional military operations carried out in the event of an already ongoing armed conflict or conducted as the first step preparing the immediate start of conventional military operations altogether comprising an armed conflict.\nWhether “cyber war”, i.e. military operations conducted exclusively by the means of the Internet or other computer networks without the employment of other weaponry (in the following referred to as: “isolated” CNO), will ever per se be classified as “use of armed force” and thus comprise an armed conflict, depends on future State practice. As there is an absence of detailed academic work on this particular\n See D. Fleck (ed.), *The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law* (Oxford / New York, Oxford University Press, 2008, 2nd ed.), §§ 202 and 210; see also a compendium of scholar opinions in: International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), *How is the Term “Armed Conflict” Defined in International Humanitarian Law?*, Opinion Paper (March 2008), p. 1 et seq., available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf.\n J.

What\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nquestion, the following remarks will show criteria useful for the assessment whether particular types of “isolated” CNO constitute an armed conflict (A.). Furthermore, it will be analysed how the ius in bello terms “attack”, “act of violence” and “hostilities” apply to CNO (B.).\n## A. “Isolated” CNO as Armed Conflict\nAs stated above, an (international or non-international) armed conflict occurs when States or – under certain circumstances – (a State and/or) organized armed group(s) use “armed force” against each other.\nOf course, the notion of “use of armed force” – indicating that differences and confrontations did indeed reach the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and thus trigger the applicability of the ius in bello – is to be distinguished from the term “use of (armed)” force pursuant to Article 2(4) UN Charter, although the two terms are closely related. Whenever a State conducts actions considered as a “use of armed force” in the meaning of ius ad bellum against another State, this indicates the outbreak of hostilities reaching the level of “use of force” in the meaning of ius in bello and thus the threshold of an armed conflict triggering the applicability of LOAC – with the possible exception of quick, discrete and “surgical” use of force in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter without further retort by the victim (as e.g. the bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osirak/Iraq by Israeli Air Force in 1981).\nIn the following, criteria for the assessment whether a particular type of “isolated” CNO constitutes an armed conflict will be developed. The question whether a certain type of CNO can be deemed as “use of armed\nTargets? What Rules of Engagement?”, in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 434; see also the remarks by L. Doswald-Beck, 'Some Thoughts on Computer Network Attack and the International Law of Armed Conflict', in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 165.\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nforce” (in the *ius in bello* meaning) will be examined (while – apart from the above stated exception – exactly the same criteria can indicate whether “use of force” in the meaning of the *ius ad bellum* is given). However, most academic writings on CNO do refer to “use of armed force” in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter. References to such writings will be made when useful and appropriate in the discussion of the term “use of armed force” in the *ius in bello* meaning.\nAccording to the traditional understanding, the assumption is that the “use of armed force” requires the employment of kinetic weaponry; that is the employment of a tool designed to cause kinetic effects of physical nature on a body or on an object. CNO are usually neither designed nor intended to directly cause kinetic effects. The transfer of data and its delay or interruption, as well as the manipulation, suppression or deletion of data cannot be deemed to cause kinetic effects in the common meaning of the term. Therefore, a significant qualitative difference between CNO and conventional weapons can be identified. In contrast, some similarities between CNO and biological or chemical weapons (hereinafter referred to as BC weapons) can be conceived. The use of BC weapons does not cause destruction in conventional sense, because these weapons do not set free any kinetic energy.72 The employment of BC weapons is considered as a form of “use of armed force” because, although not resulting in physical destruction of material, these weapons are employed in order to cause death or injury to living things.73 Thus, in the case of BC weapons, the term “weapon” is defined with reference to their effects rather than their method, which perfectly corresponds with the effects-based approach inherent to public international law. Consequently, the majority of scholars rightly insist on an effects-based interpretation of the term of “use of armed force” in the context of CNO.74\nTherefore, in the following, different categories of potential effects which can be caused by CNO will be illustrated in order to determine when CNO must be deemed as “use of armed force”.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\ni. Death, Physical Injury and/or Destruction of Property\nAccording to the nearly uniform opinion among scholars (to which the author of the present survey subscribes), a CNO – similarly to the effects caused by BC weapons – should be considered as “use of armed force” if it results in death, physical injury or the destruction of property.75 As illustrated above (II.1.C), CNO can indirectly76 cause such effects.\nAccording to a minority view amongst scholars, a CNO, even if it indirectly causes death, physical injury or the destruction of property, qualifies as “use of armed force” only if at the same time it amounts to a “use of structural force”.77 “Structural force” is described in the public international law literature as a physical incursion into a State’s\n\nM.N. Schmitt proposes a catalogue of criteria indicating that CNO constitute “use of force”:\n- severity of the effects, i.e. threat of physical injury or destruction of property,\n- immediacy of the occurrence of the negative consequences,\n- direct nexus between the CNO and the negative consequences caused,\n- invasiveness of the consequences on foreign territory,\n- measurability of the consequences,\n- pre-assumption of illegitimacy of the CNO according to national rules and to the International Public Law, based on the prima facie illegitimacy of the use of force in international relations (the author of the present survey only guesses that the term “illegitimacy” indeed stands for “illegality”).\nSee Schmitt, supra note 28, pp. 65 et seq. This approach is not convincing because of the circular reasoning it contains. It cannot be decided whether a particular act is indeed illegal, by the simultaneous assertion of the illegality of the same act.\n\nterritory without the employment of conventional or mass destruction weapons, leaving the attacked State the “use of armed force” as the only option open for effective self-defence (e.g. in the case of intentional spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing widespread flooding).78 Thus, “structural force” is deemed as “use of armed force” in the sense of Article 2 (4) UN Charter if it has the same effect as an “armed attack” triggering the right to self-defence pursuant to Article 51 UN Charter.79 However, it must be considered that there is a significant qualitative difference between “use of armed force” and an “armed attack”. According to the prevailing opinion among public international law scholars and the settled jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, an “armed attack” only occurs when the “use of armed force” reaches a certain level of intensity in regard to its effects and scale.80 When this threshold of intensity is not reached, the respective actions in question can still be considered as “use of armed force”, although they do not constitute an “armed attack”.81 Therefore, the above presented view asserting that CNO can only be deemed as “use of force” when it comprises “structural force”, and thus setting the terms of “use of armed force” and “armed attack” equal, is highly questionable.\nFurthermore, some scholars demand additional criteria to be met in order to classify CNO as “use of armed force”. This is the direct nexus between the CNO and physical damage, the immediacy of the occurrence of the physical damage (in the sense that the occurrence of the damage does not depend on any additional factors) as well as whether the damage can be foreseen at all.82 However, these criteria determine the conditions of attribution of the damage to a certain action, and are therefore not relevant for the specification of the term “use of armed force”.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n## ii. Destruction of Data\nSome academic writings assert that the destruction of data of substantial importance and/or of significant economical value should be considered as “use of armed force”.83 But, in consequence, it would need to have been ascertained in every particular case whether indeed data of some economic value has been destroyed or whether the CNO is to be considered as trivial because the compromised or deleted data is of little or no value. In addition, it must be considered that in the case of a so-called DoS attack84 data will not be destroyed but rather its use and information value will be diminished by delay of its transmission or by temporary denial of access to the data. Furthermore, the effect of CNO directed against data only is not comparable to the effects of conventional weapons, for example a bombardment, or of BC weapons. Therefore, the above presented view is not convincing, as it is of little practical value and could lead to unbearable results.\nOther scholars assert that at least the destruction of data symbolizing an asset (e.g. data of an electronically operated banking account) should be considered as “use of armed force”.85 They suggest that this assessment would reflect the obligation to protect civilian objects from dangers arising from military operations.86 However, electronic assets, accounts, demands or claims cannot be equated with objects or physical property and their destruction cannot be compared with the destructive effects on physical property caused by conventional (or BC) weapons. Therefore, the opinion presented above does not capture accurately the translation of the traditional understanding of the term “use of armed force” into the “cyberspace”.\nIf, however, a CNO was to be directed against the whole economic or banking system as one of the critical infrastructures of a State, the situation must be judged differently (see III.1.A.v. on critical infrastructure systems).\n## iii. “Theft” of Data\nMoreover, it is asserted that the “theft” of particular data should be considered as “use of armed force”, if information of vital interest to\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\na State, for instance classified information, is compromised. Also the “theft” of all data of military nature (regardless of the classification) should be considered as “use of armed force”. However, the “theft” of data (CNE) merely represents a kind of modern espionage which is not generally forbidden under public international law. All in all, “theft” of data – even classified data of importance to the military – cannot be deemed as having similar effects as conventional or BC weapons and therefore cannot be judged as “use of armed force”. Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict.\niv. Massive Disruption of Military C3-Systems\nAdditionally, some scholars assert that the destruction or medium to long-term disruption of military command, control and communication systems (C3-systems) is to be deemed as “use of armed force”. Indeed, the intended outcome, namely the disruption of military communications and the consequent restraining ability on military command and control, can be achieved both through the physical destruction of respective systems by conventional weapons and through the massive disruption of the systems by malicious CNO. As such, the effect of a corresponding CNO is quite comparable to the effects of the employment of conventional weapons. This view is supported by Article VI of the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities concluded between the USA and the Soviet Union on 12 June 1989. According to this provision, the disruption of command and control systems (C2), resulting even in a mere restraint of those systems, would be regarded as a dangerous military activity. Given the political context of the agreement the provision indicates that a – massive – disruption of\n Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846, 855; contra: Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 10.\n Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846 and 856.\n D’Amato, supra note 61, p. 67; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 32 with further references. In regard to CNO as a modern form of espionage see: von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 134. Apart from the penalisation of espionage resulting from respective national law systems, spying is restrained by certain provisions of public international law, e.g. the taboos stated by the diplomatic and consular law protecting diplomatic and consular archives and correspondence, i.e. respective electronic databases and communication via the Internet.\n See M. Bothe, ‘Völkerrechtliche Verhinderung von Gewalt (ius contra bellum)’, in W. Graf Vitzthum, Völkerrecht (Berlin, De Gruyter, 2001), Section 8, § 10.\n Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8. See also Sharp, supra note 75, p. 129, who recognizes the right to self-defence against an attack on computer networks of “vital interest” to a State.\n Vol. 28 I.L.M. 1989, pp. 877 et seq.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nmilitary C3-systems could indeed be seen by States as “use of force”.\n## v. Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems\nThere is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]” This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.\nHowever, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment. This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems. It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing\n See supra section II.1.C.\n Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599.

Contra: Dinstein, supra note 75, p. 105; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8, who demand the occurrence of physical damage outside the targeted computer networks in order to qualify CNO as use of force.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nsimilar effects on critical infrastructure systems would be considered as “use of armed force”.\nvi. Intermediate Result\nAll in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities”\nAs far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\n2. Restraints for Malicious CNO Resulting from LOAC Provisions\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of\n\nwhich is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).\n## A. Prohibited Methods and Means of Warfare\n### i. Perfidy\nArticle 23(f) HR in conjunction with Articles 38 and 39 AP I as well as Article 12 AP II prohibit the misuse of distinctive emblems, signs, signals or flags of protected entities, including those of the Red Cross and its associated entities and of the United Nations. Furthermore, the provisions ban the misuse of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Party to the particular armed conflict as well as of the adversary Party (though, in regard to the latter only while engaging in attack or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations). Moreover, Article 44(3) AP I states the obligation for all members of the armed forces to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.\nAlthough the above-mentioned provisions refer to physically visible symbols carried by individuals or objects, the rules can also be observed in the \"cyberspace\". The spirit and purpose of these provisions is to preserve the neutrality of certain entities and to protect certain groups against dangers arising from military operations. Therefore, Parties to an armed conflict must not misuse the identity of these entities or groups. Consequently, the \"cyber identity\" (i.e. website, e-mail address, email header, IP address and other technical data sent while connected to the Internet) of one of the protected organisations or groups must not be used at any time during the conduct of CNO. A simple example of the ban would be that the header of an e-mail sent to adversary armed forces, containing a virus, indirectly causing physical damage outside the targeted network, must not show, for instance, the Red Cross as the\n Also see the Annex I to the AP I.\n Exceptions to those rules are stated in Article 39(3) AP I in regard to espionage and to the conduct of armed conflict at sea.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nsender. Also, while hacking adversary computer networks, the CNO forces must not feign technical data, which would lead to presumption of the “cyber identity” of a civilian if the concrete CNO conducted is to be considered as an “attack” or an “act preparatory to an attack” in the meaning of Article 44(3) AP I. Moreover, any respective manipulation of websites belonging to the protected entities would be illegal.\nIn addition, the prohibition of Article 23(b) HR in conjunction with Article 37(1) AP I, to kill, injure or capture an adversary under recourse to perfidy, applies to CNO. In general terms, perfidy describes an act which leads the adversary to erroneously believe that he or she is entitled to, or is obliged to accord protection under LOAC (see the definition of perfidy in Article 37(1) AP I). The ban covers, inter alia, intentional dissemination of misinformation to the adversary Party about the intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender, or about an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, as well as feigning civilian, non-combatant or protected status (e.g. of a United Nations employee or of a member of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, by using respective emblems, signs, signals or uniforms, see Art. 23(f) HR and Art. 37(1) AP I). The aforementioned misinformation can generally be transmitted by the means of the Internet, for example by e-mail or as a statement on a website. As already stated (e.g. supra II.2.), the “cyber-identity” of the aforementioned protected persons can easily be feigned in the “cyberspace”. However, the above described dissemination of misinformation or feigning of the (cyber) identity of a protected person is prohibited only if it directly results in the death, injury or capture of the adversary.\nConversely, legal ruses of war in the sense of Article 24 HR and Article 37(2) AP I, which are merely aimed to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly, offer a broad field of application to CNO. Thus, it is imaginable that a Party to an armed conflict establishes a so-called honey net around its own computer network, i.e. an outside-network building a buffer around its own computer network, which is only minimally protected against hacking and, technically speaking,\n The specific nexus between the dissemination of misinformation or feigning of a protected status on the one hand and the death, injury or capture of the adversary on the other hand is required in order to establish accountability of armed forces, as – in the traditional understanding of warfare – all military actions always pursue death, injury or capture of the adversary, see M. Bothe, K.J. Partsch &amp; W.A. Solf, *New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts. Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949* (The Hague / Boston / London, Martinus Nijhoff, 1982), Art. 37 (1) AP I, no. 2.4, p. 204.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nappears perfectly realistic, but contains false information, for example on planned military operations or on the status of own forces and their location. Such a honey net could be established specifically in the hope that the adversary Party would compromise it and – in this way – obtain false information.\n## ii. Methods or Means of Warfare Prohibited Because of the Nature of Their Effects\nSome methods or means of warfare are prohibited because of the nature of their effects.\nAccording to Article 51(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. This ban refers to the dissemination of certain information to the civilian population. As this information could be easily transmitted by means of computer-based information systems, for example via e-mail or as information on a website, this prohibition must be considered during the planning and the conduct of CNO.\nFurthermore, Article 23(e) HR, Article 35(2) AP I, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980 and its Protocols as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 prohibit the employment of methods or means of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Equally, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57(2)(a)(iii) AP I stipulate that an attack which may be expected to cause loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. As it is perfectly possible that a cyber attack could indirectly cause physical damage (see supra II.1.C), it must be examined beforehand whether the anticipated (indirect) effect would be excessive in the sense of the above-mentioned provisions. In this regard, as the expected effects of concrete CNO\n Those are: Protocol on Non-Detectable Fragments (Protocol I) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III) of 1980, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV) of 1995, and Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V) of 2003.\n See E.T. Jensen, ‘Unexpected Consequences from Knock-Out Effects: A Different\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nare to be assessed, the practical criteria for the examination resemble to ones for the analysis of the effects caused by other (e.g. conventional) weapons.\nMoreover, according to Article 51(4) AP I indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Attacks are deemed to be indiscriminate, when they are not or cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or when their effects cannot be limited (see Art. 51(4)(a)-(c) AP I). It is perfectly possible that CNO equated to an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello) or an “act of violence” (see III.1.B.) could have indiscriminate effects, in the case of global, uncontrolled spreading of viruses, bugs and – in future – micro-mechanical organisms via the Internet. However, damaging software could be programmed in such a way so as to only target computer systems with specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. An uncontrolled spread of malware, as well as any cascade effects, could be easily prevented by appropriate programming.\nHowever, the vast majority of malicious CNO will not achieve the quality of a “method or means of combat, the effects of which are indiscriminate”. The inductive conclusion drawn from the examples given by Articles 51(4)(a) and (b) AP I shows that the provisions refer to methods or means of combat which result in physically “devastating” physical effects.\nFinally, Article 35(3) in connection with Article 55(1) AP I prohibits the employment of methods or means of warfare which may be expected to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. This provision covers only especially extensive, intensive and long-lasting environmental damage, which exceeds the scale of both the quality and quantity of “ordinary” environmental damage which is expected to occur in the course of combat.[108] Severe damage of the natural environment can always be caused when dangerous forces are set free, such as by radiation escaping from a nuclear power plant, the explosion of a chemical or pharmacy installation, or the breaking of a dam or dyke. As such effects could be caused indirectly by CNO\nStandard for Computer Network Operations?', Vol. 18 American University LL.Rev. 2003, pp. 1178 et seq.; and Schmitt, supra note 28, p. 82.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(see supra II.1.C), the prohibition of Article 35(3) AP I must be also considered for operations primarily conducted within “cyberspace”.\n## B. Prohibited Targets\nFurthermore, LOAC provisions granting protection for non-combatants and for civilian objects are of significance for CNO.\n### i. Civilians Population and Individual Civilians\nThe civilian population as a whole, as well as individual civilians (see Art. 50 AP I), are protected against “attacks”, “acts of violence” and “effects of hostilities”. Accordingly, CNO which are not deemed as being “use of force”, and thus not comprising an “attack” (in the meaning of *ius in bello*), “act of violence” or “effect of hostilities” (see supra III.1.B) would not be contrary to LOAC and – from the perspective of international humanitarian law – could legally be directed against civilians.\nConversely, CNO considered as being a “use of force” could only be directed against civilians launching malicious CNO against the armed forces constituting “direct participation in hostilities” within the meaning of Article 51(3) AP I and Article 13(3) AP II. In order to distinguish between private hacking as “direct participation in hostilities” and hacking as a mere criminal act, all circumstances of a specific case must be taken into consideration (see also supra II.2).\nFurthermore, according to Article 48 AP I, the Parties to an armed conflict must, at all times, distinguish between the civilian population\n See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52(1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Art. 13(2) AP II.\n See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n Concurring: Schmitt, supra note 106, p. 378.\n The examination of the different approaches to the question of the direct participation of civilians in hostilities, and especially of the temporal scope of the loss of protection otherwise granted by international humanitarian law, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further examination, the following literature may be recommended selectively: N. Melzer, *Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities* (Geneva, ICRC, May 2009), available at www.icrc.org; Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 51 AP I, no. 2.4.2.2., p. 303; M.N. Schmitt, ‘Direct Participation in Hostilities and 21st Century Armed Conflict’, in H. Fischer, U. Froissart, W.H. von Heinegg &amp; C. Raap (Hrsg.), *Krisensicherung und humanitärer Schutz – Crisis Management and Humanitarian Protection. Festschrift für Dieter Fleck* (Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), pp. 505–529.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nand combatants. Admittedly, the conventional (visual) criteria for the identification of a combatant as set out in Articles 43 and 44 AP I are not helpful for CNO, during which the acting individuals are not physically visible. However, the obligation to distinguish can also be met within “cyberspace”. In the “virtual world”, a computer of a combatant can be distinguished from the computer of a non-combatant according to its IP address and other technical data automatically sent during an Internet session. It can easily be verified by everybody in one of the official WhoIs? Internet databases to which person or entity a specific IP address or an IP address range is assigned. In addition, the “owner” and the responsible administrators of websites can be found in the WhoIs? databases. Thus, in principle it can be confirmed whether a particular actor in the “virtual world” should be considered as a member of the armed forces or as a civilian.\nNevertheless, some challenges as to the identification of a person acting in the “cyberspace” as a combatant will remain. For example, a member of regular armed forces and thus a combatant will not be recognizable as such when using his private computer at home, the latter sending during an Internet session information identifying the user as a civilian. This resembles the “real world” situation, when a soldier is not wearing the uniform when being at home and thus cannot visually be identified as a combatant as well. Thus, the remaining challenges are not new and will mostly resemble similar “real world” cases.\n## ii. Civilian Objects\nAccording to Article 48 AP I, civilian objects must be distinguished from military objectives. Civilian objects must not be the objects of attack or reprisals (Articles 48, 52(1)-(2) and 57 AP I, see also Art. 23(g) HR and further specific regulations in Articles 53–56 AP I and Articles 14–16 AP II). Generally, this principle of distinction, as well as the above-mentioned prohibitions, can also be observed within the “virtual world”.\n See the profound examination by S. Watts, ‘Combatant Status and Computer Network Attack’, Vol. 50 No. 2 Virginia J.I.L. 2010, pp. 391–447.\n The WhoIs? databases of the RIRs (see supra note 58) provide information on which IP address is assigned to which end customer (in the case of dynamic IP-addresses: to which Internet Service Provider). Thus, the database DENIC (available at http://www.denic.de) provides respective information on “.de” domains, and the database RIPE (available at http://www.ripe.net) on the other domains in Europe, InterNIC (available at http://www.internic.net/whois.html) on the domains “com”, “edu”, “int”, “net” or “org”. The database Network Information Center (available at http://www.nic.com) leads to official and regional WhoIs? databases as well as to respective private databases available online.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nViruses, bugs and – in the future – micro-mechanical organisms can be programmed in such a way that they only affect military computer networks, namely those with corresponding IP addresses or IP address ranges. The identification of a computer or computer system as military or civilian can be made by a search request of a specific IP address in one of the Whols? databases (see supra III.2.B.i).\nMalicious CNO against a purely military computer network, such as the Intranet or other communication systems of armed forces supported by the Intranet, would be perfectly legal in regard to LOAC. CNO launched against civilian computer networks – in case they are not to be considered as military objectives pursuant to Article 52(2) AP I – would only be allowed when they are not to be considered as an “attack” in the sense of Article 49(1) AP I, i.e. would not cause any physical damage (see supra III.1.B). A mere suppression or denial of access of the civilian population to a computer network or to specific data as well as the mere manipulation or the deletion of particular data would not fall under the prohibition of attack, as long as physical damage in- or outside the directly affected networks is not caused. For example, the deletion of a particular electronically operated bank account of a civilian would not be forbidden as a matter of LOAC.\nDistinction between civilian objects and military objectives becomes difficult when a computer network is used by both combatants and non-combatants (so-called dual use objects). This applies especially to the global Internet where, apart from the civilian population, there is a high probability that it will also be used by Parties to an armed conflict for the purposes of communication and information gathering. According to some scholars, the Internet is to be deemed as a military objective as soon as it is also used for military purposes.[116] Considering that nowadays the Internet is as an equally important means of communication as telephone and telegraph connections were in the past, the aforementioned opinion is supported by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had already in 1956 classified the latter as military objectives.[117]\n[116] This assertion is made in general terms, referring to communication networks used for both military and civilian purposes by Jensen, supra note 105, pp. 1160 et seq.; J.P. Terry, ‘The Lawfulness of Attacking Computer Networks in Armed Conflict and in Self-Defense in Period Short of Armed Conflict: What are the Targeting Constrains?’, Vol. 169 Mil. L. Rev. 2001, p. 85; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 35. Similarly: Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, no. 2.4.2., p. 324.\n[117] Annex Military Targets to the Draft Rules for the Limitation of Dangers Incurred\n\nHowever, some scholars refuse to classify civilian means of communication merely co-used for military purposes as a military objective. Indeed, in order to avoid any “automatism”, a thorough examination of the definition of a military objective provided by Article 52(2) AP I will be necessary. The definition clearly refers to objects only. Thus, at first sight, it seems doubtful whether the “virtual world” of the Internet can be deemed to be an object. However, the computer system Internet is not a purely intellectual construction. It comprises a multitude of objects, including technical equipment as servers, cables, cross points and access points; thus, the provision is in general applicable to the Internet. According to this definition, the computer system Internet or any other (dual use) computer network is to be considered as a military objective, if\n- the computer network makes an effective contribution to military action by its use, and\n- the total or partial destruction or neutralization of the computer network offered a definite (i.e. concrete and perceptible) military advantage (in regard to the overall military operation).\nWhether the Internet meets these conditions depends on the degree to which the other Party to the armed conflict uses the Internet, and whether this Party can easily revert to alternative communication means. Therefore, the characterisation of the Internet, or other dual use computer networks, as a military objective depends on the circumstances of the specific situation, especially on the degree of the dependence of the adversary Party on those networks, *ergo* on the level of the technologisation of the adversary armed forces.\nEven if the Internet was to be considered to be a military objective in the context of a particular armed conflict, it must be considered that it would be allowed to be attacked only as far as its physical elements\nby the Civilian Population in Time of War, see Fleck, supra note 66, § 443. von Heinegg, supra note 77, pp. 150 seq.\n The examination, whether the “contribution” shall have a particular significance for or shall merely support a certain military operation, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further details see Fleck, supra note 66, § 442; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.3., p. 324.\n See R. Wedgwood, ‘Proportionality, Cyberwar and the Law of War’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 225; and von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 150.\n Wedgwood, supra note 120, p. 225; Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 149; Fleck, supra note 66, § 444; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.4. See also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) of the ICC Statute.\n\n(e.g. server, cross points and WLAN access points) are located on the territory of one of the Parties to the particular armed conflict. But, even if such an attack was conducted successfully, a connection to the Internet could still be made from the same geographical area, for example via a mobile phone or other device enabled with respective software permitting Internet connectivity. Thus, an attack against the Internet intending the *quasi* disabling of a network within the area of conflict is unlikely to succeed.\n### iii. Objects under Special Protection\nAdditionally, LOAC provides special protection against attacks and reprisals for specific civilian objects. Corresponding prohibitions can be found in Article 27 HR, Articles 19-21 GC I., Articles 22 and 24 GC II., Articles 18 *et seq.* GC IV, Article 4 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954 and in its Protocol I of 1954 and Protocol II of 1999, Articles 12, 21, 24 *et seq.*, 54(2) and (4) and 56 AP I as well as in Articles 11 and 14–16 AP II. Pursuant to these provisions, special protection is provided for dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (*inter alia* drinking water installations and water irrigation works), medical units and transportation, historic monuments, works of art or places of worship etc. As far as incorporating computer-based elements, the above-mentioned objects could be disrupted or even destroyed by the means of a cyber attack. Therefore, the computer-based cooling system of a nuclear power plant, for example, must not be disabled by remote control, a drinking water installation must not be destroyed by a computer controlled opening and closing of its valves, a medical aircraft must not be caused to crash by manipulation of data of an air traffic control system, or a museum protected by *ius in bello* must not be flooded by the remote activation of a water sprinkler system.\n In general terms, a *Wireless Local Area Network* (WLAN) describes a local wireless and direct connection between two or more mobile end devices (*clients*), which are equipped with a wireless access device. Usually, *clients* access the Internet via a central bridge (so-called *access point*). The bridge has a *router*, which – based on a *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol* (DHPC server) – assigns a dynamic IP address to each *host* (see also *supra* note 58) seeking connectivity to the Internet.\n In order to disable the Internet, all its thirteen *root servers* (i.e. the main *domain name servers* or the main server layer of the internet) would have to be disconnected or destroyed. For security reasons, those servers are located in different, secret sites which are geographically distant. It is asserted that disabling up to ten of the *root servers* would probably merely delay the data transfer via the Internet.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nGenerally speaking, the aforementioned provisions, which provide special protection for specific civilian objects, can cease in the event that the objects are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy or for regular, significant and direct support for military operations of the enemy. In general terms, an active counter-CNO (back-hacking) could be legally launched once a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit to stop the forbidden activities, and after such warning has remained unheeded. For example, in the case of the computer network of a medical unit, if it had been identified as the location of origin of malicious CNO, as an exception, an active counter-CNO could be launched if a warning about the forthcoming back-hacking had been given in advance, for instance in the form of a pop-up window which would appear on the computer screen of the cyber attacker.\nIt should also be considered that as far as an attack against an object is forbidden, the enemy must not be led to attack such objects. Therefore, CNO which would correspondingly manipulate a targeting database of the adversary Party to the armed conflict in order to assign the data of the geographical coordinates of a civilian object under special protection to the data of a military objective of the adversary Party would be forbidden. As an example, when manipulating the adversary's targeting database, a munitions factory must not be assigned the geographical coordinates of a hospital.\n## 3. The Law of Neutrality and the Cyberspace\nFirst of all, neutrality in the sense of *ius in bellum* has to be distinguished from permanent neutrality (e.g. the cases of Austria, the Holy See, and Switzerland), i.e. the legal obligation undertaken in peacetime to remain neutral in cases of armed conflict or war between other States, and from the mere neutrality policy (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Ireland), which, nonetheless, can have some legally binding effects due to the situation of confidence created in which other States may rely on the (political) declarations to remain neutral (principle of estoppel).\n## A. The Applicability of the Law of Neutrality\nNeutrality is a particular status of a State not Party to an armed conflict of significant scope or – according to a traditional view – to a “war\n Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1105.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin the legal sense” between other States. Although it is not crucial for the purposes of the present survey to decide which view is to be followed, it may be mentioned that the International Court of Justice stated in its Advisory Opinion on the *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* of 8 July 1996 that “[...] the principle of neutrality [...] is applicable [...], to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used”. However, it must always be taken into consideration that in particular cases the rules governing neutrality may be modified by collective self-defence provisions such as Article 51 UN Charter and Article 5 North Atlantic Treaty (depriving a State of the possibility to legally join an armed conflict or a war on the side of the aggressor) and by (binding) decisions taken by the UN Security Council (see Articles 2(5) and 25 and Chapter VII UN Charter; the obligation to assist any action taken by the UN in accordance with the Charter would forestall a State to appeal to its neutrality).\nIn the following it will be shown that the rules on neutrality – which are over 100 years old – apply to military operations conducted in cyberspace (during an armed conflict of significant scope or a “war in the legal sense”). When examining the law of neutrality, no difference will be made between the specific rules applying to land, air or sea warfare, as the distinction between these areas is not relevant to CNO.\n## B. Prohibition of CNO Causing Physical Damage\nFirst and foremost, the rules of neutrality protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the neutral State, see Article 1 Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907 (HC V) and Art. 1 Hague Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 1907 (HC XIII).\nThus, the principle of neutrality prohibits causing physical damage on the sovereign territory of a neutral State. Consequently, a malicious\n The discussion of the question, whether rules on neutrality apply in situations of war (in legal sense) only or also in situations of an armed conflict of significant scope, would exceed the scope of the present survey. Interested readers may be referred to the assessment in Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1106.\n ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90 (emphasis by the author).\n See further details at Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1103; and G. Walker, ‘Information Warfare and Neutrality’, Vol. 33 *Vanderbilt J. Transnational L.* 2000, pp. 1079 et seq.\n ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90. Regarding the necessary criteria of a “physical encroachment”\n\nCNO would only breach the principle of the territorial inviolability of a neutral State if it – indirectly – caused physical damage (deaths, injuries or destruction of property) on the territory of a neutral State or medium to long-term disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a neutral State (see supra III.1.A.vi). In this regard, the physical damage could refer to physical components (technical equipment) of the Internet and/or other computer systems as well as to objects/living beings outside the affected computer systems.\nIn regard to critical infrastructure systems, it must always be considered that they can be shared by several States (e.g. an electricity distribution system is shared between Laos and Thailand, between Venezuela and Brazil, between Canada and the United States and between Indonesia and Singapore; one telecommunication system is shared by several States in East and South-East Asia).[129] Thus, before targeting a critical infrastructure system of the adversary it must always be examined (in addition to other LOAC provisions relevant to targeting) whether the estimated damage could also automatically affect another State neutral to the particular armed conflict or war.\n# C. The Use of Telecommunication Means Belonging to a Neutral State\nAccording to Article 8 HC V, a neutral State can allow the belligerents to use \"telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals\". The neutral State also has the right to restrict or prohibit the use of such communication means, if applied (by the State, companies or individuals) impartially to all belligerents (see Article 9 HC V and 9(1) HC XIII).\nIn regard to the Internet, such a restriction or prohibition could be enforced by a neutral State by applying certain software to all Internet cross points located on its territory. The software would scan the Internet traffic for data packages sent by the belligerents and delete them. Of course, a neutral State could also disable all technical components supporting the worldwide network Internet and located on its territory. This way, the belligerents would not use the Internet components located on the territory of the neutral State, although the Internet system as such would continue to function and could be further used by the Parties to the armed conflict or war.\nsee Greenberg, Goodman &amp; Soo Hoo, supra note 75, p. 10.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nIn the case one Party of the armed conflict or war used the computer network located on the territory of a neutral State to send malicious CNO to the computer systems of the other belligerent – either by launching malicious CNO from neutral State’s territory or by using Internet cross points or other technical equipment located on its territory –, the neutral State would have the right to “protect” its neutral status by taking appropriate actions (e.g. back-hacking). If it failed to do so, the neutral State would have – pursuant to the principle of non-discrimination of belligerents – the obligation to allow the affected belligerent to take action against the malicious CNO.^[130]^\n## D. Data Streams Passing the Territory of a Neutral State\nHowever, it is perfectly possible, even likely, that in the course of the conduct of CNO the data stream carrying malicious components (e.g. viruses or worms) to the adversary’s computer systems passes Internet crossing points and servers located on the territory of a neutral State. However, this would not result in violation of neutrality law.\nFirst of all, a Party to a conflict cannot influence whether a data stream crosses the technical components of the Internet situated on the territory of a neutral State or not. Every data stream sent via the Internet is divided in data packages, each one of which takes – out of millions possible routs – a certain route from cross point to cross point around the globe. The respective choices are done automatically by the Internet system (depending on the traffic load on the routes) and cannot be foreseen or influenced.^[131]^\nFurthermore, according to Article 3(a) HC V and Article 5 HC XIII, a Party to an armed conflict or war is only forbidden to “[e]rect on the territory [including territorial waters] of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea”, and pursuant to Article 3(b) HC V to “[u]se any installation of this kind established by them [i.e. belligerents] before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages”. This means that belligerents are allowed to use all non-purely military means of communication erected or established on the territory of a neutral State – by whomever – before the armed conflict or war. This would apply to all technical installations on the territory of\n^[130]^ Jensen, *supra* note 105, pp. 238 et seq.\n^[131]^ Walker, *supra* note 127, pp. 1079 et seq.\n\nthe neutral State being part of the worldwide, already existing computer network Internet, as it is – also historically – a communication means used by civilians also. It is asserted within academic writings that the establishment of a connection to the Internet as such should be deemed as similar to the forbidden “erecting” of a “communication apparatus”. However, it is more convincing to compare the establishment of a connection to the Internet to connecting to the worldwide telephone system by dialling a phone number – which would surely not be considered as forbidden “erecting” a “communication apparatus” by a belligerent.\nFinally, it must be endorsed that, because the law of neutrality does provide special provisions referring to communication systems on land or in territorial waters (Art. 3 HC V and Art. 5 HC XIII), there is no need or space for an (analogous) application of rules relating to the innocent passage through territorial waters, as asserted in some scholar writings.\n## IV. Concluding Remarks\nGiven the developments in technology and reliance on computer systems, in the future, CNO are likely to be of considerable significance for the planning and conduct of military operations. One of the reasons is that both the equipment and the conduct of CNO are extremely inexpensive when compared to conventional military operations. In addition, CNO can be conducted by only a few experts and from any location distant from the (traditional) area of combat, which safeguards the physical protection of the members of armed forces involved. Furthermore, as mentioned above, within the context of so-called asymmetric warfare, CNO can be a powerful weapon in the hands of non-state actors against the technologically highly developed armed forces of post-industrial States sensitive to malfunctions of their computer networks.\nOwing to the potential physical effects of CNO, the Parties to any future armed conflict in which CNO will be carried out, either in support of conventional military abilities or as the only method of war fighting conducted, will have to observe relevant LOAC provisions. The spirit and purpose of these protection granting rules, as well as the values they reflect, are timeless. They offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n *Id.*\n Such an assertion is made by Walker, *supra* note 127.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nNeither a lack of regulation nor a need for amendment of “aged” norms can be identified, when a teleological interpretation of the provisions is applied.\nThe future practice of the armed forces will show whether adjustments in the interpretation of relevant LOAC provisions will have to be made. The practice of the international community will decide, whether in the future it will be considered necessary to increase the level of the humanitarian protection during armed conflicts, and thus to include protection e.g. of data contained in computers or computer networks of non-combatants. Unquestionably, lawyers advising armed forces will have ever more to deal with corresponding questions of law and to understand the technical details of CNO as an emerging weapon, means or method of war.\n\n## Summary – Résumé – Samenvatting – Zusammenfassung – Riassunto – Resumen\n## Summary – Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nThe Internet has become the most essential means of communication and information. This results in a high dependency upon reliable operations of Internet based communication systems, especially those supporting critical infrastructure systems. Given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to security, the vulnerability of computer systems has become a significant matter of (national or collective) security to many States as well as to NATO. The potential conduct of “Computer Network Operations” (CNO), i.e. military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks, presents some legal challenges. This survey first examines the nature of CNO and discusses the difficulties of identification of the origin and of attribution of a malicious action carried out via or in the cyberspace to a certain actor. After the presentation of some criteria for the qualification of CNO as “use of armed force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning), the survey argues that the Laws of Armed Conflict, including the over hundred years old principles and provisions of neutrality, do apply to CNO. At the same time, it demonstrates that the provisions offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n## Résumé – Les Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques et le Droit des Confits Armés\nL’internet est devenu un moyen de communication et d’information indispensable.

Dit heeft geleid tot een grote afhankelijkheid van op Internet gebaseerde communicatiesystemen, vooral van die systemen die kritische infrastructuur ondersteunen. Door de beperkingen van het Internet op het gebied van beveiliging, is de kwetsbaarheid van computersystemen een zaak van (nationale of collectieve) veiligheid geworden voor veel staten en voor de NAVO. Computer netwerk operaties (CNO), dat wil zeggen defensieve of offensieve militaire handelingen door middel van Internet of andere computernetwerken, roept juridische vragen op. Dit artikel onderzoekt eerst wat CNO is en bespreekt de moeilijkheden rond het identificeren van de bron van en toerekening aan een bepaalde actor van een vijandige handeling die in of via cyberspace wordt uitgevoerd. Nadat een aantal criteria voor de kwalificatie van CNO als geweldgebruik (in de zin van het *ius in bello*) zijn geponeerd, beargumenteert het artikel dat het humanitair oorlogsrecht, waaronder de principes en regels betreffende neutraliteit die meer dan honderd jaar oud zijn, zich lenen voor toepassing op CNO. Aangetoond wordt dat de bepalingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht binnen dit domein een niveau van bescherming bieden dat vergelijkbaar is met het niveau dat van toepassing is op het gebruik van conventionele wapens.\n## Zusammenfassung – Computernetwerkoperationen und das humanitäre Völkerrecht\nDas Internet wurde zu einem essentiellen Kommunikations- und Informationsmittel unserer Zeit.

Da das Internet in Bezug auf die Sicherheit Mängel aufweist, wurde die Integrität von Computersystemen für manche Staaten so wie auch für die NATO zu einer Frage der (nationalen bzw. kollektiven) Sicherheit. Das potenzielle Durchführen von Computernetzwerkoperationen (CNO), d.h. defensiven oder offensiven Handlungen der Streitkräfte unter Inanspruchnahme des Internet oder anderer Computernetzwerke, bietet einige Herausforderungen rechtlicher Art. In dem vorliegenden Artikel wird zunächst die Natur von CNO dargelegt. Ferner werden die Schwierigkeiten in Bezug auf die Identifizierung des Ursprungs und die Zurechnung einer im virtuellen Raum vorgenommenen schädigenden Handlung zu einem bestimmten Akteur erörtert. Nachdem einige Kriterien für die Einordnung von CNO als „Anwendung bewaffneter Gewalt“ (im Sinne des *ius in bello*) vorgestellt werden, wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht, einschließlich der über hundert Jahre alten Prinzipien und Regelungen des Neutralitätsrechts, auf CNO anwendbar ist. Zugleich wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht hierbei einen humanitären Schutzstandard bietet, der demjenigen gleicht, der bei der Anwendung konventioneller Waffen gilt.\n## Riassunto – Computer Network Operations e il diritto dei conflitti armati\nLa rete internet è divenuta il più importante mezzo di comunicazione ed informazione dell’era contemporanea. Ciò determina una sostanziale dipendenza dal corretto funzionamento dei sistemi di comunicazione basati su tale rete, specialmente per ciò che concerne quelli di sostegno ad infrastrutture critiche. Vista la scarsa sicurezza della comunicazione via internet, la vulnerabilità dei sistemi informatici è diventata una questione di rilievo per la sicurezza (nazionale o collettiva) di molti stati e per la NATO. La potenziale condotta di ‘Operazioni militari su reti informatiche’ (*Computer Network Operations – CNO*), ovvero operazioni militari difensive o offensive scatenate tramite internet o per altra via informatica, presenta tuttavia talune incertezze dal punto di vista giuridico. Dapprima questo articolo esamina la vera natura delle CNO, mettendo in luce le difficoltà di identificazione e attribuzione di un’azione delittuosa portata avanti nello spazio cibernetico (o mediante quest’ultimo), a danno di un determinato soggetto. Successivamente, dopo aver presentato alcuni criteri guida per una corretta qualificazione delle CNO come un vero e proprio “uso della forza armata” (secondo lo *ius in bello*), l’articolo dimostra che il diritto dei conflitti armati, assieme agli ultra-centenari principi e norme sulla neutralità, trova applicazione\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin caso di CNO. Allo stesso modo, lo scritto evidenzia come tali norme offrano un livello di protezione umanitaria comparabile con quello applicabile nel caso di uso di armi convenzionali.\n## Resumen – Operaciones a través de la red informática y Derecho de los Conflictos Armados.\nInternet ha acabado por convertirse en un importante medio de comunicación e información de la era contemporánea. Esto lleva consigo un alto grado de dependencia con respecto a los sistemas de comunicación centrados en la red, especialmente por lo que se refiere a los sistemas que sirven de apoyo a infraestructuras vitales. Vista la escasa seguridad de las comunicaciones a través de internet, la vulnerabilidad de los sistemas de información se ha convertido en una cuestión prioritaria para la seguridad (nacional y colectiva) de muchos Estados así como para la OTAN. Las conductas potenciales que pueden ser objeto de las operaciones a través de la red informática (Computer Network Operations – CNO), como por ejemplo acciones militares tanto ofensivas como defensivas llevadas a cabo a través de internet o de otras redes de información, presentan aspectos interesantes desde el punto de vista jurídico. El presente artículo examina en primer lugar la naturaleza de las CNO y analiza las dificultades que existen para identificar el sistema en el que tiene su origen un ataque y la posterior atribución de una conducta delictiva llevada a cabo en el espacio cibernético (o a través de este último) a un sujeto determinado. Tras la exposición de algunos criterios que permiten calificar las CNO como “uso de fuerza armada” (en el sentido del *ius in bello*), el artículo demuestra que el Derecho de los Conflictos Armados resulta de aplicación a las CNO, incluidos los principios y preceptos ultra-centenarios relativos a la neutralidad. Al mismo tiempo, pone de manifiesto cómo ese Derecho ofrece un nivel de protección humanitaria comparable con el que es de aplicación en el campo del uso de armas convencionales."

Introduction\nIn this day and age, the Internet¹ is one of the most important means of communication and information. During the last 30 years it has gradually become an essential aspect of the economy in a globalized world and plays an indispensable role in, amongst other things, the administrative and judicial systems of technologically developed countries. All in all, critical infrastructure systems in States with high levels of technology dependency are acutely reliant upon reliable and effective operations of Internet based communication systems. Thus, given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to the security, protection and defence of the integrity of computer networks, the vulnerability of these communication systems has become a significant matter of national security to many such States. Accordingly, the current National Security Strategies of the USA², of the United Kingdom³,\n¹ The Internet is globally administered by a Californian (US) non-profit, public-benefit corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which, in the framework of a Public Private Partnership, is associated with and reports to the US Department of Commerce (although, according to the information on ICANN’s website, the organisation heavily emphasises its international nature and independence). ICANN bears global responsibility for ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet as well as for coordinating the Internet system of unique identifiers, i.e. for the assignment of IP-address ranges (since 2005 not directly to users but to regional organisations – see infra note 58). It is further responsible for the generic codes and country codes of the Internet top level domain as well as for the management and maintenance of the (secret) Internet root server system (see infra note 122). ICANN is the successor organization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which was executing the above-mentioned tasks directly on behalf of the US Department of Commerce (information available at http://www.icann/org/en/factsheets/factsheet.html; unless indicated otherwise, all URLs cited in the present survey were last visited on 31 November 2010). Originally, it was planned to transform ICANN into an independent organization in October 2006. During the 2nd World Summit on the Information Society, organized by the UN in Tunis in November 2005, it was proposed to submit ICANN (and thus the Internet itself) to management by the UN. The USA rejected this proposal and declared its intent to keep the control over ICANN for the time being (information available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/).\n² The President of the United States of America, National Security Strategy (May 2010), p. 27 et seq., available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf.\n³ Her Majesty’s Government, A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The National Security Strategy (October 2010), pp. 11 and 27, available at http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191639.pdf?CID=PDF&amp;PLA=furl&amp;CRE=nationalsecuritystrategy.\n49\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nand Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defence White Paper,⁴ all seek to address the issue of cyber-attacks.

Additionally, the Internet offers the possibility for offensive and/or defensive military actions by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. The military term “Computer Network Operations” (CNO) refers, generally speaking, to computer hacking and back-hacking in the context of a military operation.\nWorldwide, military forces are preparing for the fight in cyberspace. It has been alleged that Israeli armed forces have engaged in CNO activities since the early 1990s.8 The USA established a US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in Fort Meade, Maryland on 23 June 2009 (operational as of October 2010) which unified the already existing cyber capabilities of the US National Security Agency and several US military services (Army Forces Cyber Command, 24th US Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command).9 According to media reports, Belgium10, Germany11, South Korea12 (allegedly in reaction to respective North Korean endeavours), and the\nUN Documents A/55/63 of 4 December 2000, A/56/121 of 19 December 2001, A/57/239 of 20 December 2002, and A/58/199 of 23 December 2003.\n7 This includes: United Nations, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and Organization of American States (OAS).

Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n¹³ See C.

The Nature and Significance of CNO\nIn the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).\n## 1. Forms and Effects of CNO\nThe concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA).\nThe above-mentioned components of CNO are strongly interrelated. An adversary’s CNA can help one’s own CND when analysed appropriately. A CNE cannot be conducted without CNA, as the information to be gathered by CNE will mostly be protected by firewalls, passwords and other barriers that are erected to prevent an adversarial CNA. Finally, CNA cannot be conducted without CNE, as without information gathering on the targeted network’s architecture and systems the CNA would effectively be conducted blindly.\nWhile the practical value of the taxonomy of CND/CNE/CNA therefore is questionable, it will be presented in more detail below as most academic writings and media reports refer to this classification.\n## A. CND\nCND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\none’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone).¹⁶ The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies,¹⁷ merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA.\n## B. CNE\nAccording to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”.¹⁸ This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage.\nAccording to open source reports, the vast majority of CNO activities conducted during peacetime consist of CNE. For example, already in 2007, the British intelligence service MI5 warned all financial service providers and companies in Great Britain against concerted cyber espionage endeavours by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.¹⁹ In summer 2007, the computer systems of Germany’s Federal Chancellery as well as those of some federal ministries were infected with spyware (i.e. espionage software) reported to have originated from China.²⁰ According to the Annual Report 2009 of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, computer systems of Germany’s federal and state governments and of private businesses were targeted by hundreds of (successful and/or unsuccessful) CNE. Foreign intelligence\n16 For more information on CND see: NATO, ‘Defending against Cyber Attacks’, available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49193.htm.\n17 See e.g. US Navy Marine Corps Intranet, ‘Active Computer Network Defense Strategy: Cyber-Centric Maneuver Warfare’, available at http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/PEOEIS/NMCI/Documents/Attachment%2011%20-%20Active%20Computer%20Network%20Defense%20Strategy_nmcia11.pdf.\n18 NATO Standardization Agency (NSA), *NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions* (2010), Doc.

However, it can be assumed that CNE is very likely to be used in support of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance.\n## C. CNA\nCNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”.²⁴ These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware²⁵). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks.\nRelatively harmless, data modification in the course of a CNA can modify and deface a website (defacement). This is often conducted by hackers who wish to express their political view (hacktivism). Another widely spread form of CNA is the Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack\n21 Bundesministerium des Innern, Verfassungsschutzbericht 2009 (2010), p. 308, available at http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/de/publikationen/verfassungsschutzbericht/vsbericht_2009/vsbericht_2009.pdf; summary (in English), pp. 9 et seq., available at http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/SHOW/vsbericht_2009_engl.pdf.\n22 W.J.

The particular DDoS-techniques are as diverse as the – partly very effective – countermeasures²⁷ developed since 2000.\nHowever, the deletion or modification of data in a successfully intruded computer network can be more hazardous. Hackers can generate wrong information, for instance in the military environment the content of electronically transmitted orders, plans and maps or the localization data of military targets contained in a targeting-database.\nMoreover, it is possible that a CNA could – indirectly – cause death, physical injury or physical destruction of property. As far as chemical plants, nuclear power stations, oil refinery installations, gas store installations or electrical power distribution installations have or rely on computer-based control systems, these systems could be penetrated and manipulated. Thus, a CNA could cause the explosion of a nuclear power plant if the cooling systems were disabled via remote control. The same applies to computer-based control systems of transportation systems. By manipulation of the rail points, train derailments or collisions could be caused; penetration and minimal amendments to the programming of an air traffic control system could result in aircraft incidents. Therefore, the classification of CNO as a non-lethal weapon, as asserted by some scholars,²⁸ has to be challenged in this regard. Also, the general assertion made that CNO, in its current form would generally not violate LOAC, is questionable.²⁹\n26 A Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS attack) is a Denial of Service attack (DoS attack) simultaneously conducted from several computers, which are interconnected by a previously (and mostly in secret) established computer network (net boot). During a DoS attack, the targeted server is overloaded by a mass of connectivity requests, which first results in a significant delay of data processing. This subsequently leads to a denial of data processing service and finally results in the disabling of the affected server. This effect can be caused by sending either masses of data packages (e.g. emails to an email server) or masses of connectivity requests (e.g. masses of connectivity requests to a website).\n27 See C.

The list of critical infrastructure systems will slightly differ from State to State. By way of example, the following areas identified by the German Federal Office of Security of Information Technology (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) can be considered as critical infrastructure systems:³⁰ transportation and traffic (postal services, local traffic, roads, rail system, aviation, sea and inland navigation); energy (nuclear plants, distribution and transfer systems of electricity, oil, gas); hazardous substances (chemical and biological agents, nuclear reactors); information and telecommunication technology; finance, currency and insurance (banks, insurance companies, financial service providers, stock markets); public utilities (health, emergency and rescue sector, disaster control, food and water supply, waste management); government, administration, justice, police, customs and armed forces.\nMany of these critical infrastructure systems are based on computer-based control systems, such as the generation and distribution of electricity or telecommunications. Some function entirely on the basis of an Internet connection, including the banking and stock exchange systems. Other areas are increasingly reliant on the Internet, for example the so-called e-justice and e-government. In any technologically highly developed, post-industrial State most of the critical infrastructure systems can be deemed to depend on the operability and efficiency of electronic data transfer. The devastating effects and the subsequent disruption of the ordre public caused by a CNA are limited only by the imagination of the reader. Therefore, cyber security plays a paramount role for the national security of many States and was noted as one of the major perils for the Alliance's security in NATO's Strategic Concept of 2010 (see supra I).\nThere is open source information available in the media on CNA being conducted during peacetime.\nThe only publicly known case, in which the attribution of a CNA to a particular State can be asserted, was the penetration and temporary disabling of Syrian air defence networks, especially the radar systems, by Israel on 6 September 2007, immediately followed by an airstrike by Israel's Air Force destroying Syria's Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Deir-Az-Zur.³¹\n³⁰ See the list of critical infrastructure systems, available at https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/Publikationen/Faltblaetter/F17KritischeInfrastruktur.html.\n³¹ Ben-David, supra note 8.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nA more prominent case of a successful CNA against a State are the DDoS-attacks launched against several critical infrastructure systems in Estonia during the 27 April – 18 May 2007 timeframe. The “attacks”³² targeted websites and communication channels of the government and commercial services.³³ For example, the web-services of the major banks Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank were (at one-time) interrupted for 1,5 hours;³⁴ the website of a governing coalition party was defaced;³⁵ emergency phone numbers were disengaged for a short time;³⁶ and three major Estonian Internet Service Providers and some online news providers were disconnected (although it is unclear for how long).³⁷ The estimated physical (because of the disengagement of emergency phone numbers) and economic damage caused by the DDoS-attacks remains unclear. The attacks most probably originated from the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the relatively simple DDoS-methods and the political context of the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, it is asserted that the “attackers” were politically motivated private persons (hacktivism).³⁸\nAnother example of successful CNA during peacetime are the defacement and DDoS-attacks launched against Lithuania between 28 June and 1 July 2008. The CNA may have been connected either to the amendment of Lithuania’s laws to prohibit the display of symbols of the Soviet Union or the singing of its anthem in public³⁹ or to the unilateral veto⁴⁰ against discussions on an EU energy partnership deal with Russian Federation. Over 300 Lithuanian websites were defaced, including those of the Government.⁴¹ Given the pro-Russian contents\n32 The term “attack” does not indicate the legal assessment of the incidents as an “armed attack” in the meaning of Art. 51 UN Charter or Art. 5 North Atlantic Treaty.\n33 E.

It did gain national interest of the victim States, when it began to affect governmental and military computer systems, including those of the British Parliament,43 and the French and British air forces and navies.44\nThe worm “Stuxnet”, which affected over 100.000 computer systems worldwide between June and September 2010, targeted industrial control systems of gas pipelines and power plants based on Siemens software, aiming to establish remote control of the systems and to hide any changes in the computer systems from the operators of the equipment.45 As the vast majority of the infections affected Iran’s critical infrastructure systems, in particular of the nuclear power plant near Bushehr, and the worm’s reach and complexity obviously required enormous personnel and budgetary investments as well as a considerable amount of time to write the code (in secrecy), the involvement of a foreign organization or State is suspected.46\n42 B.

At the beginning of the operation, websites and the mailing system of NATO were blocked and infected by a virus (Melissa), apparently originating in Serbia.⁵⁰ Furthermore, some defacement attacks were launched by politically motivated individuals (hacktivism) from Serbia and Russia (*Black Hand, From Russia with Love, Russian Hacker Union*, etc.) against websites of NATO and NATO Member States.⁵¹ Equally, some hackers groups (politically) supporting the NATO operation (e.g. *Dutchthreat* or *Kosovo Hackers Group*) tried to infiltrate the governmental websites of Yugoslavia.⁵² Moreover, it is suspected that the President of the USA, *Bill Clinton*, did authorize the *Central Intelligence Agency* (CIA) to penetrate the computer systems of banks in Greece, Lebanon, Russia and Cyprus in order to clear the banking accounts of the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia *Slobodan Milošević*.⁵³ As the respective plans are said to have been\n‘Foreign-made’ ‘Stuxnet’ Computer Virus’, *The Washington Post* online of 27 September 2010, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092706229.html.\n⁴⁷ NATO, *NATO 2020: Assured Security, Dynamic Engagement.

It can be assumed that also in the near future CNO are very likely to be used merely in support of a conventional military operation, mainly military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, or in order to influence the perception of a particular political conflict in the online media.\n## 2. Identification of the Origin and Attribution of Malicious CNO\nIt will always be difficult to unequivocally identify the computer systems that malicious CNO originated from and to attribute the attack to a certain entity, group or a State.\nA cyber attack is distinguished by its rapidness.

It is highly unlikely that hackers will leave any tangible evidence, for example in the protocols of the intrusion detection systems of the attacked network, as such evidence in these protocols is easy to delete once the network is penetrated.\nMoreover, and further aggravating the issue, a cyber-attack can be conducted “anonymously”, for example by using one of the (often) free of charge anonymisation services offered on the Internet which would hide the unique characteristics of the hackers’ computer system. These unique characteristics are the so-called IP address⁵⁸ as well as other technical data⁵⁹ a computer sends while connected to the Internet.\n⁵⁸ An IP address (Internet Protocol number) is a twelve digit number, which identifies a computer or another network device during an Internet session. An IP data package is the basic element of data transmission via the Internet. It comprises: a header (containing information on the source, destination, status and fragmentation of the transmitted data) and a payload (containing the transmitted data). At the very beginning of the Internet, the IANA (see supra note 1) assigned static IP addresses, i.e. IP addresses permanently assigned to a particular user, to companies, organizations, universities and also to individuals. The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only. After the particular Internet session the dynamic IP address is assigned to another user and client of the respective Access Provider. At present, the so-called static IP-addresses are only being used for leased Internet-lines of major corporations and other entities.\n⁵⁹ These include: Media Access Control address (MAC address) or – for the operating system Apple – the Airport ID of a computer (order of numbers, which clearly identifies a computer hardware); Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, details on the assignment of a MAC address or Airport ID to an IP address); Service Set Identity (SSID, details on the network name); Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol (WEP, coded details about the network); as well as details on the operating system and its adjustments. These details are – if not blocked – automatically transferred during the Internet session to any computer requesting this information by a so-called PING (Packet InterNet Grouper). A PING is computer software sending an ICMP-Echo-Request data package to the destination address of the host which is to be scanned, i.e. to the IP address, to the Domain Name System name (DNS name) or to the Network Basic Input Output System name (NetBIOS name) of the targeted host. The targeted system automatically responds by an ICMP-Echo-Reply, if – according to the usual adjustments of the system – the system supports the ICMP package.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nFurthermore, the Internet offers possibilities for deception in regard to the identity of the hackers' computer systems. It is perfectly possible to feign someone else's IP address and other technical data (so-called malicious misrepresentation or spoofing) and thus to operate in the Internet under someone else's \"cyber-identity\". The connection to the Internet can also be established via a mobile phone or other device with a feigned identity number. Additionally, the data stream can be conducted through the whole globe via a chain of computers of numerous unsuspecting individuals, if so-called zombie software (partly offered free of charge on the Internet) has been secretly installed on the respective computers by using Trojans. One of these computers could subsequently be misused as the sender of the data stream (so-called remote control). Thus, in the case of a cyber attack, even after a back tracing of the malicious data stream, the victim can seldom be sure as of the identification and geographical location of the computer system the attack originated from.\nAbove all, even if a malicious data stream of a cyber attack would indeed be successfully back-traced to the hackers' computer systems, it will – highly probable – remain unproven which individuals of which citizenship and on who's orders were operating the systems identified. Therefore, the attribution of a cyber attack to a certain individual, group, entity or State will most probably be based on unproven suspicions or indications only.\nConsequently, it will be very unlikely to recognize at first sight – and probably even after detailed technical analysis – whether the attack was conducted by a mischievous teenager, by a criminal (including a terrorist), by a group with extremist or terrorist background or by the adversary Party in an armed conflict.\nThese uncertainties will surely add to the complexity of both the legal analysis of a cyber attack and the victim's decision on choosing a subsequent course of action. Considering the difficulty in identifying and locating the hackers' computer systems and – most importantly – attributing the attack, in most cases it will remain in doubt whether national police forces and public prosecutors or, in the framework of international judicial cooperation, the police forces and public prosecutors of a foreign State, or the armed forces (in the case the attack occurs during an already existing armed conflict and is believed to have originated with a party to the armed conflict, or in the case the effects of the cyber-attack are comparable to a conventional armed\n63\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nattack and trigger the right to self-defence) retain main responsibility to deal with the case.\n## 3. CNO in Modern Warfare\nThe significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations is manifold.\nWhilst most armed conflicts in this day and age are occurring in regions that are technologically less sophisticated (e.g. Afghanistan, Sudan or Chad), this does not result in the irrelevance of the Internet and of CNO. It must be taken into consideration that, in regard to communication abilities and collection of open source information, the parties to armed conflicts in less well developed regions are also essentially dependent on – aside from radio traffic – wireless Internet connectivity, as other communication and information systems (e.g. telecommunication media, print media, telephone lines) are often non-existent.\nIt is especially evident in the context of so-called asymmetric warfare and in the hands of non-state actors, for instance terrorists, that CNO can be a powerful weapon, primarily against post-industrial States and their potent armed forces. More than ever, post-industrial States have technologically highly developed armed forces at their disposal, which correspondingly react most sensitively to technical disorder. It is the dependence on the technology which makes them extremely vulnerable to a cyber attack.\nAs CNO can be conducted from any place in the world by as little as a few experts and, in addition, are extraordinarily inexpensive when compared with conventional military operations, they offer a particularly practical and extremely powerful \"weapon\". Therefore, all aspects of CNO (see supra II.1) show an increasing significance in the context of national as well as of international security.\nAs the Head of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Co-ordination Centre stated already in 2008: \"Cyber war can become a very effective global problem because it is low-risk, low-cost, highly effective and easily globally deployable. It is almost an ideal weapon that nobody can ignore\".60\n60 N. Heath, ‘NATO: Cyber Terrorism “as Dangerous as Missile Attack”’, silicon.com of 7 March 2008, available at http://www.silicon.com/technology/security/2008/03/07/nato-cyber-terrorism-as-dangerous-as-missile-attack-39170300/.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## III. Legal Analysis of CNO\nAlthough some scholars plead for a general prohibition of CNO, currently such a ban does not exist.⁶¹ However, many international and domestic legal restrictions do apply to CNO – a fact which makes a legal analysis a complex undertaking.\nApart from the fundamental principle of public international law, namely the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations, a number of specific areas of public international law may apply to CNO. As data packages pass through the territory of several States when sent via the Internet, the provisions of territorial sovereignty must be considered. Also, data manipulations might – under certain circumstances – be judged as intervention in domestic affairs of a State, which would be considered illegal under public international law. Further, because satellite technology is involved, space law and especially treaties relating to satellites must be considered. As CNO can interfere with telecommunication systems and always result in data amendments in the working storage of the attacked computer system, both international telecommunications law and international copyright law (in regard to software) require a thorough analysis. In case human rights treaty law is generally applicable, their respective provisions must be considered, especially in regard to secrecy of correspondence, telecommunications and data protection, as well as to the right to receive and impart information and ideas. Restraints for CNO can further result from the provisions of diplomatic and consular law, whenever diplomatic or consular computer systems are involved. Furthermore, it has been asserted that international environmental law principles of good neighbourhood and of the prevention of significant trans-boundary harm would be applicable to CNO in analogy.⁶² In addition, the provisions of\n⁶¹ A. D’Amato pleads for a general prohibition of CNO, emphasizing that the stability of the international community depends on the free flow of information (p. 68) and that every nation has a vital interest in the operationability of the Internet (p. 69), see A. D’Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’, in M.N. Schmitt &amp; B.T. O’Donnell (eds.), *Computer Network Attack and International Law* (Newport / Rhode Island, US Naval War College, 2002), pp. 59–71, pp. 67–69. See also: T. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position. Viewing Information Warfare as Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’, Vol. 30 *Case Western Reserve* J.I.L. 1998, p. 600.\n⁶² Such assertion is made – emphasizing that the Internet is a global resource comparable to the natural environment – by T. Stein &amp; T. Marauhn, ‘Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen’, Vol. 60 *Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht* 2000, p. 21. A similar approach\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nrespective national law systems, especially constitutional and criminal law, must always be taken into consideration.\nGiven the variety of areas of law involved and the limited scope of this survey, the following remarks will be restricted to the analysis of LOAC, focusing on the provisions of the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Annex to the Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (HR), the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GC) $^{63}$ and their Additional Protocols I $^{64}$ (AP I) and II $^{65}$ (AP II) (2). However, first of all, it must be examined under which conditions LOAC applies to CNO (1).\n## 1. The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict\nAccording to common Article 2 of the GCs, LOAC applies to\nall cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.\nIn practice, armed conflicts surely can be considered as the main case of application of LOAC. Pursuant to the prevailing opinion an\nis taken by the (non-binding) OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems of 1992, which call for cooperation of States (Principle 6) in the area of comprehensive protection of information systems (Principle 4), and which stipulate an imperative of deliberation in the use of information systems (Principle 3), see OECD Doc. OCDE/GD(92)190. However, an analogous application of international environmental law provisions is not convincing because of the lack of an “unintended omission” or of the absence of regulation. International telecommunication law, in particular the provisions of the (almost universally ratified) Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) of 22 December 1992, binds ITU Member States to far-reaching obligations in regard to the protection of communication and information systems (see in particular Articles 6, 33, 38, 45 and 47 of the ITU Constitution).\n$^{63}$ These are: Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949; Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949; Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\n$^{64}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\n$^{65}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\ninternational armed conflict occurs when one or more States have recourse to “armed force” against another State, regardless of the legality, reasons or the intensity of this confrontation.⁶⁶ This opinion is confirmed by the Commentary on the GC which states that “any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2”.⁶⁷ Art. 1(4) AP I extends the definition of international armed conflict to include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination.⁶⁸ A non-international armed conflict within the meaning of the common Article 3 GCs occurs when one or more non-governmental organized armed groups are involved and the situation reaches a certain threshold of confrontation, distinguishing it from internal disturbances, riots or acts of banditry (see also Art. 1 AP II).⁶⁹ Thus, a situation of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and consequently the application of LOAC is given, when States or – under certain circumstances – organized armed groups use “armed force” against the other Party.\nUnsurprisingly, LOAC is applicable to all CNO conducted either in support of conventional military operations carried out in the event of an already ongoing armed conflict or conducted as the first step preparing the immediate start of conventional military operations altogether comprising an armed conflict.\nWhether “cyber war”, i.e. military operations conducted exclusively by the means of the Internet or other computer networks without the employment of other weaponry (in the following referred to as: “isolated” CNO), will ever per se be classified as “use of armed force” and thus comprise an armed conflict, depends on future State practice. As there is an absence of detailed academic work⁷⁰ on this particular\n⁶⁶ See D. Fleck (ed.), *The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law* (Oxford / New York, Oxford University Press, 2008, 2nd ed.), §§ 202 and 210; see also a compendium of scholar opinions in: International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), *How is the Term “Armed Conflict” Defined in International Humanitarian Law?*, Opinion Paper (March 2008), p. 1 et seq., available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf.\n⁶⁷ J.

J.P. Terry describes cyberwar as a “lesser form of international conflict”, see J.P. Terry, ‘Responding to Attacks on Critical Computer Infrastructure. What\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nquestion, the following remarks will show criteria useful for the assessment whether particular types of “isolated” CNO constitute an armed conflict (A.). Furthermore, it will be analysed how the ius in bello terms “attack”, “act of violence” and “hostilities” apply to CNO (B.).\n## A. “Isolated” CNO as Armed Conflict\nAs stated above, an (international or non-international) armed conflict occurs when States or – under certain circumstances – (a State and/or) organized armed group(s) use “armed force” against each other.\nOf course, the notion of “use of armed force” – indicating that differences and confrontations did indeed reach the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and thus trigger the applicability of the ius in bello – is to be distinguished from the term “use of (armed)” force pursuant to Article 2(4) UN Charter, although the two terms are closely related. Whenever a State conducts actions considered as a “use of armed force” in the meaning of ius ad bellum against another State, this indicates the outbreak of hostilities reaching the level of “use of force” in the meaning of ius in bello and thus the threshold of an armed conflict triggering the applicability of LOAC – with the possible exception of quick, discrete and “surgical” use of force in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter without further retort by the victim (as e.g. the bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osirak/Iraq by Israeli Air Force in 1981).\nIn the following, criteria for the assessment whether a particular type of “isolated” CNO constitutes an armed conflict will be developed. The question whether a certain type of CNO can be deemed as “use of armed\nTargets? What Rules of Engagement?”, in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 434; see also the remarks by L. Doswald-Beck, 'Some Thoughts on Computer Network Attack and the International Law of Armed Conflict', in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 165.\n71 Illustrating the different lines of argument in regard to further specification of the term “force”, as used by the UN Charter, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. Therefore, without further explanation in the following it will be assumed that “force” under the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is to be understood as “armed force” as well as forcible measures of physical nature short of an armed attack, which can be defeated by the use of armed force only (e.g. deliberate spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing a widespread cross-boundary flood); see especially in regard to the distinction between the term “force” on the one hand and the terms “economic” or “political coercion” on the other hand, representatively: A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations. A Commentary (Oxford / New York, Oxford University Press, 2002, 2nd ed.), § 21.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nforce” (in the *ius in bello* meaning) will be examined (while – apart from the above stated exception – exactly the same criteria can indicate whether “use of force” in the meaning of the *ius ad bellum* is given). However, most academic writings on CNO do refer to “use of armed force” in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter. References to such writings will be made when useful and appropriate in the discussion of the term “use of armed force” in the *ius in bello* meaning.\nAccording to the traditional understanding, the assumption is that the “use of armed force” requires the employment of kinetic weaponry; that is the employment of a tool designed to cause kinetic effects of physical nature on a body or on an object. CNO are usually neither designed nor intended to directly cause kinetic effects. The transfer of data and its delay or interruption, as well as the manipulation, suppression or deletion of data cannot be deemed to cause kinetic effects in the common meaning of the term. Therefore, a significant qualitative difference between CNO and conventional weapons can be identified. In contrast, some similarities between CNO and biological or chemical weapons (hereinafter referred to as BC weapons) can be conceived. The use of BC weapons does not cause destruction in conventional sense, because these weapons do not set free any kinetic energy.72 The employment of BC weapons is considered as a form of “use of armed force” because, although not resulting in physical destruction of material, these weapons are employed in order to cause death or injury to living things.73 Thus, in the case of BC weapons, the term “weapon” is defined with reference to their effects rather than their method, which perfectly corresponds with the effects-based approach inherent to public international law. Consequently, the majority of scholars rightly insist on an effects-based interpretation of the term of “use of armed force” in the context of CNO.74\nTherefore, in the following, different categories of potential effects which can be caused by CNO will be illustrated in order to determine when CNO must be deemed as “use of armed force”.\n72 J.

Death, Physical Injury and/or Destruction of Property\nAccording to the nearly uniform opinion among scholars (to which the author of the present survey subscribes), a CNO – similarly to the effects caused by BC weapons – should be considered as “use of armed force” if it results in death, physical injury or the destruction of property.75 As illustrated above (II.1.C), CNO can indirectly76 cause such effects.\nAccording to a minority view amongst scholars, a CNO, even if it indirectly causes death, physical injury or the destruction of property, qualifies as “use of armed force” only if at the same time it amounts to a “use of structural force”.77 “Structural force” is described in the public international law literature as a physical incursion into a State’s\n75 Y. Dinstein, ‘Computer Network Attack and Self-Defense’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 103; D.B.

Soo Hoo, Information Warfare and International Law (Washington, National Defence University, 1998), pp. 19 and 32.\nM.N. Schmitt proposes a catalogue of criteria indicating that CNO constitute “use of force”:\n- severity of the effects, i.e. threat of physical injury or destruction of property,\n- immediacy of the occurrence of the negative consequences,\n- direct nexus between the CNO and the negative consequences caused,\n- invasiveness of the consequences on foreign territory,\n- measurability of the consequences,\n- pre-assumption of illegitimacy of the CNO according to national rules and to the International Public Law, based on the prima facie illegitimacy of the use of force in international relations (the author of the present survey only guesses that the term “illegitimacy” indeed stands for “illegality”).\nSee Schmitt, supra note 28, pp. 65 et seq. This approach is not convincing because of the circular reasoning it contains. It cannot be decided whether a particular act is indeed illegal, by the simultaneous assertion of the illegality of the same act.\n76 In the present context the term “indirectly” means that CNO cause immediate effects on the targeted computer systems which only in the consequence result in damages outside the directly affected networks.\n77 W.H. von Heinegg, ‘Informationskrieg und Völkerrecht. Angriffe auf Computernetzwerke in der Grauzone zwischen nachweisbarem Recht und rechtspolitischer Forderung’, in V. Epping, H. Fischer &amp; W.H. von Heinegg (Hrsg.), Brücken bauen und begehen.

Beck, 2000), p. 149.\n70\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nterritory without the employment of conventional or mass destruction weapons, leaving the attacked State the “use of armed force” as the only option open for effective self-defence (e.g. in the case of intentional spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing widespread flooding).78 Thus, “structural force” is deemed as “use of armed force” in the sense of Article 2 (4) UN Charter if it has the same effect as an “armed attack” triggering the right to self-defence pursuant to Article 51 UN Charter.79 However, it must be considered that there is a significant qualitative difference between “use of armed force” and an “armed attack”. According to the prevailing opinion among public international law scholars and the settled jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, an “armed attack” only occurs when the “use of armed force” reaches a certain level of intensity in regard to its effects and scale.80 When this threshold of intensity is not reached, the respective actions in question can still be considered as “use of armed force”, although they do not constitute an “armed attack”.81 Therefore, the above presented view asserting that CNO can only be deemed as “use of force” when it comprises “structural force”, and thus setting the terms of “use of armed force” and “armed attack” equal, is highly questionable.\nFurthermore, some scholars demand additional criteria to be met in order to classify CNO as “use of armed force”. This is the direct nexus between the CNO and physical damage, the immediacy of the occurrence of the physical damage (in the sense that the occurrence of the damage does not depend on any additional factors) as well as whether the damage can be foreseen at all.82 However, these criteria determine the conditions of attribution of the damage to a certain action, and are therefore not relevant for the specification of the term “use of armed force”.\n78 Randelzhofer, supra note 71, § 21; Sharp, supra note 75, p. 101; also see Judge Schwebel’s dissenting opinion in ICJ, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Destruction of Data\nSome academic writings assert that the destruction of data of substantial importance and/or of significant economical value should be considered as “use of armed force”.83 But, in consequence, it would need to have been ascertained in every particular case whether indeed data of some economic value has been destroyed or whether the CNO is to be considered as trivial because the compromised or deleted data is of little or no value. In addition, it must be considered that in the case of a so-called DoS attack84 data will not be destroyed but rather its use and information value will be diminished by delay of its transmission or by temporary denial of access to the data. Furthermore, the effect of CNO directed against data only is not comparable to the effects of conventional weapons, for example a bombardment, or of BC weapons. Therefore, the above presented view is not convincing, as it is of little practical value and could lead to unbearable results.\nOther scholars assert that at least the destruction of data symbolizing an asset (e.g. data of an electronically operated banking account) should be considered as “use of armed force”.85 They suggest that this assessment would reflect the obligation to protect civilian objects from dangers arising from military operations.86 However, electronic assets, accounts, demands or claims cannot be equated with objects or physical property and their destruction cannot be compared with the destructive effects on physical property caused by conventional (or BC) weapons. Therefore, the opinion presented above does not capture accurately the translation of the traditional understanding of the term “use of armed force” into the “cyberspace”.\nIf, however, a CNO was to be directed against the whole economic or banking system as one of the critical infrastructures of a State, the situation must be judged differently (see III.1.A.v. on critical infrastructure systems).\n## iii. “Theft” of Data\nMoreover, it is asserted that the “theft” of particular data should be considered as “use of armed force”, if information of vital interest to\n83 See Barkham, supra note 72, p. 88.\n84 See supra note 26.\n85 M.N. Schmitt, D.H.A. Harrison &amp; Th.C.

Id.\n86 Id.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\na State, for instance classified information, is compromised.⁸⁷ Also the “theft” of all data of military nature (regardless of the classification) should be considered as “use of armed force”.⁸⁸ However, the “theft” of data (CNE) merely represents a kind of modern espionage which is not generally forbidden under public international law.⁸⁹ All in all, “theft” of data – even classified data of importance to the military – cannot be deemed as having similar effects as conventional or BC weapons and therefore cannot be judged as “use of armed force”. Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict.\niv. Massive Disruption of Military C3-Systems\nAdditionally, some scholars assert that the destruction⁹⁰ or medium to long-term disruption⁹¹ of military command, control and communication systems (C3-systems) is to be deemed as “use of armed force”. Indeed, the intended outcome, namely the disruption of military communications and the consequent restraining ability on military command and control, can be achieved both through the physical destruction of respective systems by conventional weapons and through the massive disruption of the systems by malicious CNO. As such, the effect of a corresponding CNO is quite comparable to the effects of the employment of conventional weapons. This view is supported by Article VI of the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities concluded between the USA and the Soviet Union on 12 June 1989.⁹² According to this provision, the disruption of command and control systems (C2), resulting even in a mere restraint of those systems, would be regarded as a dangerous military activity. Given the political context of the agreement the provision indicates that a – massive – disruption of\n⁸⁷ Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846, 855; contra: Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 10.\n⁸⁸ Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846 and 856.\n⁸⁹ D’Amato, supra note 61, p. 67; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 32 with further references. In regard to CNO as a modern form of espionage see: von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 134. Apart from the penalisation of espionage resulting from respective national law systems, spying is restrained by certain provisions of public international law, e.g. the taboos stated by the diplomatic and consular law protecting diplomatic and consular archives and correspondence, i.e. respective electronic databases and communication via the Internet.\n⁹⁰ See M. Bothe, ‘Völkerrechtliche Verhinderung von Gewalt (ius contra bellum)’, in W. Graf Vitzthum, Völkerrecht (Berlin, De Gruyter, 2001), Section 8, § 10.\n⁹¹ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8.

Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems\nThere is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems⁹³ by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]”⁹⁴ This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.\nHowever, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment.⁹⁵ This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems.⁹⁶ It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing\n⁹³ See supra section II.1.C.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n⁹⁵ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n⁹⁶ Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599.

Intermediate Result\nAll in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities”\nAs far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\n2. Restraints for Malicious CNO Resulting from LOAC Provisions\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of\n97 See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52 (1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n98 See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II.\n99 See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n100 Presently, 194 States are Parties to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (and thus two more States than Parties to the United Nations Charter, usually referred to as a universal treaty). The present status of ratifications to the Hague Conventions of 1907 and Geneva Conventions of 1949 as well as to their Additional Protocols of 1977 is available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO?OpenView.\n75\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nwhich is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).\n## A. Prohibited Methods and Means of Warfare\n### i. Perfidy\nArticle 23(f) HR in conjunction with Articles 38 and 39 AP I as well as Article 12 AP II prohibit the misuse of distinctive emblems, signs, signals or flags of protected entities¹⁰¹, including those of the Red Cross and its associated entities and of the United Nations. Furthermore, the provisions ban the misuse of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Party to the particular armed conflict as well as of the adversary Party (though, in regard to the latter only while engaging in attack or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations).¹⁰² Moreover, Article 44(3) AP I states the obligation for all members of the armed forces to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.\nAlthough the above-mentioned provisions refer to physically visible symbols carried by individuals or objects, the rules can also be observed in the \"cyberspace\". The spirit and purpose of these provisions is to preserve the neutrality of certain entities and to protect certain groups against dangers arising from military operations. Therefore, Parties to an armed conflict must not misuse the identity of these entities or groups. Consequently, the \"cyber identity\" (i.e. website, e-mail address, email header, IP address and other technical data sent while connected to the Internet) of one of the protected organisations or groups must not be used at any time during the conduct of CNO. A simple example of the ban would be that the header of an e-mail sent to adversary armed forces, containing a virus, indirectly causing physical damage outside the targeted network, must not show, for instance, the Red Cross as the\n¹⁰¹ Also see the Annex I to the AP I.\n¹⁰² Exceptions to those rules are stated in Article 39(3) AP I in regard to espionage and to the conduct of armed conflict at sea.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nsender. Also, while hacking adversary computer networks, the CNO forces must not feign technical data, which would lead to presumption of the “cyber identity” of a civilian if the concrete CNO conducted is to be considered as an “attack” or an “act preparatory to an attack” in the meaning of Article 44(3) AP I. Moreover, any respective manipulation of websites belonging to the protected entities would be illegal.\nIn addition, the prohibition of Article 23(b) HR in conjunction with Article 37(1) AP I, to kill, injure or capture an adversary under recourse to perfidy, applies to CNO. In general terms, perfidy describes an act which leads the adversary to erroneously believe that he or she is entitled to, or is obliged to accord protection under LOAC (see the definition of perfidy in Article 37(1) AP I). The ban covers, inter alia, intentional dissemination of misinformation to the adversary Party about the intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender, or about an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, as well as feigning civilian, non-combatant or protected status (e.g. of a United Nations employee or of a member of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, by using respective emblems, signs, signals or uniforms, see Art. 23(f) HR and Art. 37(1) AP I). The aforementioned misinformation can generally be transmitted by the means of the Internet, for example by e-mail or as a statement on a website. As already stated (e.g. supra II.2.), the “cyber-identity” of the aforementioned protected persons can easily be feigned in the “cyberspace”. However, the above described dissemination of misinformation or feigning of the (cyber) identity of a protected person is prohibited only if it directly¹⁰³ results in the death, injury or capture of the adversary.\nConversely, legal ruses of war in the sense of Article 24 HR and Article 37(2) AP I, which are merely aimed to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly, offer a broad field of application to CNO. Thus, it is imaginable that a Party to an armed conflict establishes a so-called honey net around its own computer network, i.e. an outside-network building a buffer around its own computer network, which is only minimally protected against hacking and, technically speaking,\n¹⁰³ The specific nexus between the dissemination of misinformation or feigning of a protected status on the one hand and the death, injury or capture of the adversary on the other hand is required in order to establish accountability of armed forces, as – in the traditional understanding of warfare – all military actions always pursue death, injury or capture of the adversary, see M. Bothe, K.J. Partsch &amp; W.A. Solf, *New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts. Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949* (The Hague / Boston / London, Martinus Nijhoff, 1982), Art. 37 (1) AP I, no. 2.4, p. 204.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nappears perfectly realistic, but contains false information, for example on planned military operations or on the status of own forces and their location. Such a honey net could be established specifically in the hope that the adversary Party would compromise it and – in this way – obtain false information.\n## ii. Methods or Means of Warfare Prohibited Because of the Nature of Their Effects\nSome methods or means of warfare are prohibited because of the nature of their effects.\nAccording to Article 51(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. This ban refers to the dissemination of certain information to the civilian population. As this information could be easily transmitted by means of computer-based information systems, for example via e-mail or as information on a website, this prohibition must be considered during the planning and the conduct of CNO.\nFurthermore, Article 23(e) HR, Article 35(2) AP I, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980 and its Protocols¹⁰⁴ as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 prohibit the employment of methods or means of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Equally, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57(2)(a)(iii) AP I stipulate that an attack which may be expected to cause loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. As it is perfectly possible that a cyber attack could indirectly cause physical damage (see supra II.1.C), it must be examined beforehand whether the anticipated (indirect) effect would be excessive in the sense of the above-mentioned provisions.¹⁰⁵ In this regard, as the expected effects of concrete CNO\n¹⁰⁴ Those are: Protocol on Non-Detectable Fragments (Protocol I) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III) of 1980, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV) of 1995, and Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V) of 2003.\n¹⁰⁵ See E.T. Jensen, ‘Unexpected Consequences from Knock-Out Effects: A Different\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nare to be assessed, the practical criteria for the examination resemble to ones for the analysis of the effects caused by other (e.g. conventional) weapons.\nMoreover, according to Article 51(4) AP I indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Attacks are deemed to be indiscriminate, when they are not or cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or when their effects cannot be limited (see Art. 51(4)(a)-(c) AP I). It is perfectly possible that CNO equated to an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello) or an “act of violence” (see III.1.B.) could have indiscriminate effects, in the case of global, uncontrolled spreading of viruses, bugs and – in future – micro-mechanical organisms via the Internet. However, damaging software could be programmed in such a way so as to only target computer systems with specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. An uncontrolled spread of malware, as well as any cascade effects, could be easily prevented by appropriate programming.\nHowever, the vast majority of malicious CNO will not achieve the quality of a “method or means of combat, the effects of which are indiscriminate”. The inductive conclusion drawn from the examples given by Articles 51(4)(a) and (b) AP I shows that the provisions refer to methods or means of combat which result in physically “devastating” physical effects.\nFinally, Article 35(3) in connection with Article 55(1) AP I prohibits the employment of methods or means of warfare which may be expected to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. This provision covers only especially extensive, intensive and long-lasting environmental damage, which exceeds the scale of both the quality and quantity of “ordinary” environmental damage which is expected to occur in the course of combat. Severe damage of the natural environment can always be caused when dangerous forces are set free, such as by radiation escaping from a nuclear power plant, the explosion of a chemical or pharmacy installation, or the breaking of a dam or dyke. As such effects could be caused indirectly by CNO\nStandard for Computer Network Operations?', Vol. 18 American University LL.Rev. 2003, pp. 1178 et seq.; and Schmitt, supra note 28, p. 82.\n106 See also M.N. Schmitt, 'Wired Warfare: Computer Network Attacks and the Jus in Bello', Vol. 84 I.R.R.C. 2002, pp. 372 et seq.\n107 Id.\n108 See Fleck, supra note 66, § 403. In regard to the temporal scope of the damages see respective quotations and references in regard to the course of negotiations of AP I at Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 55 AP I, no. 2.4.1., p. 346.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(see supra II.1.C), the prohibition of Article 35(3) AP I must be also considered for operations primarily conducted within “cyberspace”.\n## B. Prohibited Targets\nFurthermore, LOAC provisions granting protection for non-combatants and for civilian objects are of significance for CNO.\n### i. Civilians Population and Individual Civilians\nThe civilian population as a whole, as well as individual civilians (see Art. 50 AP I), are protected against “attacks”¹⁰⁹, “acts of violence”¹¹⁰ and “effects of hostilities”¹¹¹. Accordingly, CNO which are not deemed as being “use of force”, and thus not comprising an “attack” (in the meaning of *ius in bello*), “act of violence” or “effect of hostilities” (see supra III.1.B) would not be contrary to LOAC and – from the perspective of international humanitarian law – could legally be directed against civilians¹¹².\nConversely, CNO considered as being a “use of force” could only be directed against civilians launching malicious CNO against the armed forces constituting “direct participation in hostilities” within the meaning of Article 51(3) AP I and Article 13(3) AP II¹¹³. In order to distinguish between private hacking as “direct participation in hostilities” and hacking as a mere criminal act, all circumstances of a specific case must be taken into consideration (see also supra II.2).\nFurthermore, according to Article 48 AP I, the Parties to an armed conflict must, at all times, distinguish between the civilian population\n¹⁰⁹ See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52(1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n¹¹⁰ See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Art. 13(2) AP II.\n¹¹¹ See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n¹¹² Concurring: Schmitt, supra note 106, p. 378.\n¹¹³ The examination of the different approaches to the question of the direct participation of civilians in hostilities, and especially of the temporal scope of the loss of protection otherwise granted by international humanitarian law, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further examination, the following literature may be recommended selectively: N. Melzer, *Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities* (Geneva, ICRC, May 2009), available at www.icrc.org; Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 51 AP I, no. 2.4.2.2., p. 303; M.N. Schmitt, ‘Direct Participation in Hostilities and 21st Century Armed Conflict’, in H. Fischer, U. Froissart, W.H. von Heinegg &amp; C. Raap (Hrsg.), *Krisensicherung und humanitärer Schutz – Crisis Management and Humanitarian Protection. Festschrift für Dieter Fleck* (Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), pp. 505–529.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nand combatants. Admittedly, the conventional (visual) criteria for the identification of a combatant as set out in Articles 43 and 44 AP I are not helpful for CNO, during which the acting individuals are not physically visible.¹¹⁴ However, the obligation to distinguish can also be met within “cyberspace”. In the “virtual world”, a computer of a combatant can be distinguished from the computer of a non-combatant according to its IP address and other technical data automatically sent during an Internet session. It can easily be verified by everybody in one of the official WhoIs?¹¹⁵ Internet databases to which person or entity a specific IP address or an IP address range is assigned. In addition, the “owner” and the responsible administrators of websites can be found in the WhoIs? databases. Thus, in principle it can be confirmed whether a particular actor in the “virtual world” should be considered as a member of the armed forces or as a civilian.\nNevertheless, some challenges as to the identification of a person acting in the “cyberspace” as a combatant will remain. For example, a member of regular armed forces and thus a combatant will not be recognizable as such when using his private computer at home, the latter sending during an Internet session information identifying the user as a civilian. This resembles the “real world” situation, when a soldier is not wearing the uniform when being at home and thus cannot visually be identified as a combatant as well. Thus, the remaining challenges are not new and will mostly resemble similar “real world” cases.\n## ii. Civilian Objects\nAccording to Article 48 AP I, civilian objects must be distinguished from military objectives. Civilian objects must not be the objects of attack or reprisals (Articles 48, 52(1)-(2) and 57 AP I, see also Art. 23(g) HR and further specific regulations in Articles 53–56 AP I and Articles 14–16 AP II). Generally, this principle of distinction, as well as the above-mentioned prohibitions, can also be observed within the “virtual world”.\n¹¹⁴ See the profound examination by S. Watts, ‘Combatant Status and Computer Network Attack’, Vol. 50 No. 2 Virginia J.I.L. 2010, pp. 391–447.\n¹¹⁵ The WhoIs? databases of the RIRs (see supra note 58) provide information on which IP address is assigned to which end customer (in the case of dynamic IP-addresses: to which Internet Service Provider). Thus, the database DENIC (available at http://www.denic.de) provides respective information on “.de” domains, and the database RIPE (available at http://www.ripe.net) on the other domains in Europe, InterNIC (available at http://www.internic.net/whois.html) on the domains “com”, “edu”, “int”, “net” or “org”. The database Network Information Center (available at http://www.nic.com) leads to official and regional WhoIs? databases as well as to respective private databases available online.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nViruses, bugs and – in the future – micro-mechanical organisms can be programmed in such a way that they only affect military computer networks, namely those with corresponding IP addresses or IP address ranges. The identification of a computer or computer system as military or civilian can be made by a search request of a specific IP address in one of the Whols? databases (see supra III.2.B.i).\nMalicious CNO against a purely military computer network, such as the Intranet or other communication systems of armed forces supported by the Intranet, would be perfectly legal in regard to LOAC. CNO launched against civilian computer networks – in case they are not to be considered as military objectives pursuant to Article 52(2) AP I – would only be allowed when they are not to be considered as an “attack” in the sense of Article 49(1) AP I, i.e. would not cause any physical damage (see supra III.1.B). A mere suppression or denial of access of the civilian population to a computer network or to specific data as well as the mere manipulation or the deletion of particular data would not fall under the prohibition of attack, as long as physical damage in- or outside the directly affected networks is not caused. For example, the deletion of a particular electronically operated bank account of a civilian would not be forbidden as a matter of LOAC.\nDistinction between civilian objects and military objectives becomes difficult when a computer network is used by both combatants and non-combatants (so-called dual use objects). This applies especially to the global Internet where, apart from the civilian population, there is a high probability that it will also be used by Parties to an armed conflict for the purposes of communication and information gathering. According to some scholars, the Internet is to be deemed as a military objective as soon as it is also used for military purposes. Considering that nowadays the Internet is as an equally important means of communication as telephone and telegraph connections were in the past, the aforementioned opinion is supported by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had already in 1956 classified the latter as military objectives.\n This assertion is made in general terms, referring to communication networks used for both military and civilian purposes by Jensen, supra note 105, pp. 1160 et seq.; J.P. Terry, ‘The Lawfulness of Attacking Computer Networks in Armed Conflict and in Self-Defense in Period Short of Armed Conflict: What are the Targeting Constrains?’, Vol. 169 Mil. L. Rev. 2001, p. 85; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 35. Similarly: Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, no. 2.4.2., p. 324.\n Annex Military Targets to the Draft Rules for the Limitation of Dangers Incurred\n82\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nHowever, some scholars refuse to classify civilian means of communication merely co-used for military purposes as a military objective.¹¹⁸ Indeed, in order to avoid any “automatism”, a thorough examination of the definition of a military objective provided by Article 52(2) AP I will be necessary. The definition clearly refers to objects only. Thus, at first sight, it seems doubtful whether the “virtual world” of the Internet can be deemed to be an object. However, the computer system Internet is not a purely intellectual construction. It comprises a multitude of objects, including technical equipment as servers, cables, cross points and access points; thus, the provision is in general applicable to the Internet. According to this definition, the computer system Internet or any other (dual use) computer network is to be considered as a military objective, if\n- the computer network makes an effective contribution¹¹⁹ to military action by its use, and\n- the total or partial destruction or neutralization of the computer network offered a definite (i.e. concrete and perceptible)¹²⁰ military advantage (in regard to the overall military operation).¹²¹\nWhether the Internet meets these conditions depends on the degree to which the other Party to the armed conflict uses the Internet, and whether this Party can easily revert to alternative communication means. Therefore, the characterisation of the Internet, or other dual use computer networks, as a military objective depends on the circumstances of the specific situation, especially on the degree of the dependence of the adversary Party on those networks, *ergo* on the level of the technologisation of the adversary armed forces.\nEven if the Internet was to be considered to be a military objective in the context of a particular armed conflict, it must be considered that it would be allowed to be attacked only as far as its physical elements\nby the Civilian Population in Time of War, see Fleck, supra note 66, § 443. von Heinegg, supra note 77, pp. 150 seq.\n¹¹⁸ The examination, whether the “contribution” shall have a particular significance for or shall merely support a certain military operation, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further details see Fleck, supra note 66, § 442; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.3., p. 324.\n¹²⁰ See R. Wedgwood, ‘Proportionality, Cyberwar and the Law of War’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 225; and von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 150.\n¹²¹ Wedgwood, supra note 120, p. 225; Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 149; Fleck, supra note 66, § 444; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.4. See also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) of the ICC Statute.\n83\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n(e.g. server, cross points and WLAN¹²² access points) are located on the territory of one of the Parties to the particular armed conflict. But, even if such an attack was conducted successfully, a connection to the Internet could still be made from the same geographical area, for example via a mobile phone or other device enabled with respective software permitting Internet connectivity. Thus, an attack against the Internet intending the *quasi* disabling of a network within the area of conflict is unlikely to succeed.¹²³\n### iii. Objects under Special Protection\nAdditionally, LOAC provides special protection against attacks and reprisals for specific civilian objects. Corresponding prohibitions can be found in Article 27 HR, Articles 19-21 GC I., Articles 22 and 24 GC II., Articles 18 *et seq.* GC IV, Article 4 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954 and in its Protocol I of 1954 and Protocol II of 1999, Articles 12, 21, 24 *et seq.*, 54(2) and (4) and 56 AP I as well as in Articles 11 and 14–16 AP II. Pursuant to these provisions, special protection is provided for dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (*inter alia* drinking water installations and water irrigation works), medical units and transportation, historic monuments, works of art or places of worship etc. As far as incorporating computer-based elements, the above-mentioned objects could be disrupted or even destroyed by the means of a cyber attack. Therefore, the computer-based cooling system of a nuclear power plant, for example, must not be disabled by remote control, a drinking water installation must not be destroyed by a computer controlled opening and closing of its valves, a medical aircraft must not be caused to crash by manipulation of data of an air traffic control system, or a museum protected by *ius in bello* must not be flooded by the remote activation of a water sprinkler system.\n¹²² In general terms, a *Wireless Local Area Network* (WLAN) describes a local wireless and direct connection between two or more mobile end devices (*clients*), which are equipped with a wireless access device. Usually, *clients* access the Internet via a central bridge (so-called *access point*). The bridge has a *router*, which – based on a *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol* (DHPC server) – assigns a dynamic IP address to each *host* (see also *supra* note 58) seeking connectivity to the Internet.\n¹²³ In order to disable the Internet, all its thirteen *root servers* (i.e. the main *domain name servers* or the main server layer of the internet) would have to be disconnected or destroyed. For security reasons, those servers are located in different, secret sites which are geographically distant. It is asserted that disabling up to ten of the *root servers* would probably merely delay the data transfer via the Internet.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nGenerally speaking, the aforementioned provisions, which provide special protection for specific civilian objects, can cease in the event that the objects are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy or for regular, significant and direct support for military operations of the enemy. In general terms, an active counter-CNO (back-hacking) could be legally launched once a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit to stop the forbidden activities, and after such warning has remained unheeded. For example, in the case of the computer network of a medical unit, if it had been identified as the location of origin of malicious CNO, as an exception, an active counter-CNO could be launched if a warning about the forthcoming back-hacking had been given in advance, for instance in the form of a pop-up window which would appear on the computer screen of the cyber attacker.\nIt should also be considered that as far as an attack against an object is forbidden, the enemy must not be led to attack such objects. Therefore, CNO which would correspondingly manipulate a targeting database of the adversary Party to the armed conflict in order to assign the data of the geographical coordinates of a civilian object under special protection to the data of a military objective of the adversary Party would be forbidden. As an example, when manipulating the adversary's targeting database, a munitions factory must not be assigned the geographical coordinates of a hospital.\n## 3. The Law of Neutrality and the Cyberspace\nFirst of all, neutrality in the sense of *ius in bellum* has to be distinguished from permanent neutrality (e.g. the cases of Austria, the Holy See, and Switzerland), i.e. the legal obligation undertaken in peacetime to remain neutral in cases of armed conflict or war between other States, and from the mere neutrality policy (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Ireland), which, nonetheless, can have some legally binding effects due to the situation of confidence created in which other States may rely on the (political) declarations to remain neutral (principle of estoppel).¹²⁴\n## A. The Applicability of the Law of Neutrality\nNeutrality is a particular status of a State not Party to an armed conflict of significant scope or – according to a traditional view – to a “war\n¹²⁴ Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1105.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin the legal sense” between other States.¹²⁵ Although it is not crucial for the purposes of the present survey to decide which view is to be followed, it may be mentioned that the International Court of Justice stated in its Advisory Opinion on the *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* of 8 July 1996 that “[...] the principle of neutrality [...] is applicable [...], to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used”.¹²⁶ However, it must always be taken into consideration that in particular cases the rules governing neutrality may be modified by collective self-defence provisions such as Article 51 UN Charter and Article 5 North Atlantic Treaty (depriving a State of the possibility to legally join an armed conflict or a war on the side of the aggressor) and by (binding) decisions taken by the UN Security Council (see Articles 2(5) and 25 and Chapter VII UN Charter; the obligation to assist any action taken by the UN in accordance with the Charter would forestall a State to appeal to its neutrality).¹²⁷\nIn the following it will be shown that the rules on neutrality – which are over 100 years old – apply to military operations conducted in cyberspace (during an armed conflict of significant scope or a “war in the legal sense”). When examining the law of neutrality, no difference will be made between the specific rules applying to land, air or sea warfare, as the distinction between these areas is not relevant to CNO.\n## B. Prohibition of CNO Causing Physical Damage\nFirst and foremost, the rules of neutrality protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the neutral State, see Article 1 Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907 (HC V) and Art. 1 Hague Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 1907 (HC XIII).\nThus, the principle of neutrality prohibits causing physical damage on the sovereign territory of a neutral State.¹²⁸ Consequently, a malicious\n¹²⁵ The discussion of the question, whether rules on neutrality apply in situations of war (in legal sense) only or also in situations of an armed conflict of significant scope, would exceed the scope of the present survey. Interested readers may be referred to the assessment in Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1106.\n¹²⁶ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90 (emphasis by the author).\n¹²⁷ See further details at Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1103; and G. Walker, ‘Information Warfare and Neutrality’, Vol. 33 *Vanderbilt J. Transnational L.* 2000, pp. 1079 et seq.\n¹²⁸ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90. Regarding the necessary criteria of a “physical encroachment”\n86\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nCNO would only breach the principle of the territorial inviolability of a neutral State if it – indirectly – caused physical damage (deaths, injuries or destruction of property) on the territory of a neutral State or medium to long-term disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a neutral State (see supra III.1.A.vi). In this regard, the physical damage could refer to physical components (technical equipment) of the Internet and/or other computer systems as well as to objects/living beings outside the affected computer systems.\nIn regard to critical infrastructure systems, it must always be considered that they can be shared by several States (e.g. an electricity distribution system is shared between Laos and Thailand, between Venezuela and Brazil, between Canada and the United States and between Indonesia and Singapore; one telecommunication system is shared by several States in East and South-East Asia). Thus, before targeting a critical infrastructure system of the adversary it must always be examined (in addition to other LOAC provisions relevant to targeting) whether the estimated damage could also automatically affect another State neutral to the particular armed conflict or war.\n# C. The Use of Telecommunication Means Belonging to a Neutral State\nAccording to Article 8 HC V, a neutral State can allow the belligerents to use \"telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals\". The neutral State also has the right to restrict or prohibit the use of such communication means, if applied (by the State, companies or individuals) impartially to all belligerents (see Article 9 HC V and 9(1) HC XIII).\nIn regard to the Internet, such a restriction or prohibition could be enforced by a neutral State by applying certain software to all Internet cross points located on its territory. The software would scan the Internet traffic for data packages sent by the belligerents and delete them. Of course, a neutral State could also disable all technical components supporting the worldwide network Internet and located on its territory. This way, the belligerents would not use the Internet components located on the territory of the neutral State, although the Internet system as such would continue to function and could be further used by the Parties to the armed conflict or war.\nsee Greenberg, Goodman &amp; Soo Hoo, supra note 75, p. 10.\n129 W. Church, ‘Information Warfare’, Vol. 82 No. 837 I.R.R.C. 2000, p. 210.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nIn the case one Party of the armed conflict or war used the computer network located on the territory of a neutral State to send malicious CNO to the computer systems of the other belligerent – either by launching malicious CNO from neutral State’s territory or by using Internet cross points or other technical equipment located on its territory –, the neutral State would have the right to “protect” its neutral status by taking appropriate actions (e.g. back-hacking). If it failed to do so, the neutral State would have – pursuant to the principle of non-discrimination of belligerents – the obligation to allow the affected belligerent to take action against the malicious CNO.^^\n## D. Data Streams Passing the Territory of a Neutral State\nHowever, it is perfectly possible, even likely, that in the course of the conduct of CNO the data stream carrying malicious components (e.g. viruses or worms) to the adversary’s computer systems passes Internet crossing points and servers located on the territory of a neutral State. However, this would not result in violation of neutrality law.\nFirst of all, a Party to a conflict cannot influence whether a data stream crosses the technical components of the Internet situated on the territory of a neutral State or not. Every data stream sent via the Internet is divided in data packages, each one of which takes – out of millions possible routs – a certain route from cross point to cross point around the globe. The respective choices are done automatically by the Internet system (depending on the traffic load on the routes) and cannot be foreseen or influenced.^^\nFurthermore, according to Article 3(a) HC V and Article 5 HC XIII, a Party to an armed conflict or war is only forbidden to “[e]rect on the territory [including territorial waters] of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea”, and pursuant to Article 3(b) HC V to “[u]se any installation of this kind established by them [i.e. belligerents] before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages”. This means that belligerents are allowed to use all non-purely military means of communication erected or established on the territory of a neutral State – by whomever – before the armed conflict or war. This would apply to all technical installations on the territory of\n^^ Jensen, *supra* note 105, pp. 238 et seq.\n^^ Walker, *supra* note 127, pp. 1079 et seq.\n88\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\nthe neutral State being part of the worldwide, already existing computer network Internet, as it is – also historically – a communication means used by civilians also. It is asserted within academic writings that the establishment of a connection to the Internet as such should be deemed as similar to the forbidden “erecting” of a “communication apparatus”.¹³² However, it is more convincing to compare the establishment of a connection to the Internet to connecting to the worldwide telephone system by dialling a phone number – which would surely not be considered as forbidden “erecting” a “communication apparatus” by a belligerent.\nFinally, it must be endorsed that, because the law of neutrality does provide special provisions referring to communication systems on land or in territorial waters (Art. 3 HC V and Art. 5 HC XIII), there is no need or space for an (analogous) application of rules relating to the innocent passage through territorial waters, as asserted in some scholar writings.¹³³\n## IV. Concluding Remarks\nGiven the developments in technology and reliance on computer systems, in the future, CNO are likely to be of considerable significance for the planning and conduct of military operations. One of the reasons is that both the equipment and the conduct of CNO are extremely inexpensive when compared to conventional military operations. In addition, CNO can be conducted by only a few experts and from any location distant from the (traditional) area of combat, which safeguards the physical protection of the members of armed forces involved. Furthermore, as mentioned above, within the context of so-called asymmetric warfare, CNO can be a powerful weapon in the hands of non-state actors against the technologically highly developed armed forces of post-industrial States sensitive to malfunctions of their computer networks.\nOwing to the potential physical effects of CNO, the Parties to any future armed conflict in which CNO will be carried out, either in support of conventional military abilities or as the only method of war fighting conducted, will have to observe relevant LOAC provisions. The spirit and purpose of these protection granting rules, as well as the values they reflect, are timeless. They offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n¹³² *Id.*\n¹³³ Such an assertion is made by Walker, *supra* note 127.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nNeither a lack of regulation nor a need for amendment of “aged” norms can be identified, when a teleological interpretation of the provisions is applied.\nThe future practice of the armed forces will show whether adjustments in the interpretation of relevant LOAC provisions will have to be made. The practice of the international community will decide, whether in the future it will be considered necessary to increase the level of the humanitarian protection during armed conflicts, and thus to include protection e.g. of data contained in computers or computer networks of non-combatants. Unquestionably, lawyers advising armed forces will have ever more to deal with corresponding questions of law and to understand the technical details of CNO as an emerging weapon, means or method of war.\n90\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n## Summary – Résumé – Samenvatting – Zusammenfassung – Riassunto – Resumen\n## Summary – Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nThe Internet has become the most essential means of communication and information. This results in a high dependency upon reliable operations of Internet based communication systems, especially those supporting critical infrastructure systems. Given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to security, the vulnerability of computer systems has become a significant matter of (national or collective) security to many States as well as to NATO. The potential conduct of “Computer Network Operations” (CNO), i.e. military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks, presents some legal challenges. This survey first examines the nature of CNO and discusses the difficulties of identification of the origin and of attribution of a malicious action carried out via or in the cyberspace to a certain actor. After the presentation of some criteria for the qualification of CNO as “use of armed force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning), the survey argues that the Laws of Armed Conflict, including the over hundred years old principles and provisions of neutrality, do apply to CNO. At the same time, it demonstrates that the provisions offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n## Résumé – Les Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques et le Droit des Confits Armés\nL’internet est devenu un moyen de communication et d’information indispensable.

Étant donné les insuffisances de l’internet en matière de sécurité, la vulnérabilité des systèmes d’ordinateurs est devenue un sujet important pour la sécurité (nationale et collective) de plusieurs États ainsi que pour l’OTAN. La conduite éventuelle d’Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques (OCRI), à savoir des actions militaires offensives ou défensives prises grâce aux moyens mêmes de l’internet ou de réseaux d’ordinateurs, présente quelques défis juridiques.

Après avoir présenté quelques critères pour qualifier les OCRI comme étant une utilisation de la force armée (au sens *ius in bello*) l'auteur soutient ensuite que le droit des conflits armés ainsi que les principes et dispositions plus que centenaire en matière de neutralité s'appliquent aux OCRI. Par la même occasion, l'article démontre que ces dispositions offrent un niveau de protection humanitaire qui est comparable à celui en vigueur pour l'utilisation des armes classiques.\n## Samenvatting – Computer netwerk operaties en het humanitair oorlogsrecht\nHet Internet is uitgegroeid tot het belangrijkste communicatie- en informatiemiddel. Dit heeft geleid tot een grote afhankelijkheid van op Internet gebaseerde communicatiesystemen, vooral van die systemen die kritische infrastructuur ondersteunen. Door de beperkingen van het Internet op het gebied van beveiliging, is de kwetsbaarheid van computersystemen een zaak van (nationale of collectieve) veiligheid geworden voor veel staten en voor de NAVO. Computer netwerk operaties (CNO), dat wil zeggen defensieve of offensieve militaire handelingen door middel van Internet of andere computernetwerken, roept juridische vragen op. Dit artikel onderzoekt eerst wat CNO is en bespreekt de moeilijkheden rond het identificeren van de bron van en toerekening aan een bepaalde actor van een vijandige handeling die in of via cyberspace wordt uitgevoerd. Nadat een aantal criteria voor de kwalificatie van CNO als geweldgebruik (in de zin van het *ius in bello*) zijn geponeerd, beargumenteert het artikel dat het humanitair oorlogsrecht, waaronder de principes en regels betreffende neutraliteit die meer dan honderd jaar oud zijn, zich lenen voor toepassing op CNO. Aangetoond wordt dat de bepalingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht binnen dit domein een niveau van bescherming bieden dat vergelijkbaar is met het niveau dat van toepassing is op het gebruik van conventionele wapens.\n## Zusammenfassung – Computernetwerkoperationen und das humanitäre Völkerrecht\nDas Internet wurde zu einem essentiellen Kommunikations- und Informationsmittel unserer Zeit.

Da das Internet in Bezug auf die Sicherheit Mängel aufweist, wurde die Integrität von Computersystemen für manche Staaten so wie auch für die NATO zu einer Frage der (nationalen bzw. kollektiven) Sicherheit. Das potenzielle Durchführen von Computernetzwerkoperationen (CNO), d.h. defensiven oder offensiven Handlungen der Streitkräfte unter Inanspruchnahme des Internet oder anderer Computernetzwerke, bietet einige Herausforderungen rechtlicher Art. In dem vorliegenden Artikel wird zunächst die Natur von CNO dargelegt. Ferner werden die Schwierigkeiten in Bezug auf die Identifizierung des Ursprungs und die Zurechnung einer im virtuellen Raum vorgenommenen schädigenden Handlung zu einem bestimmten Akteur erörtert. Nachdem einige Kriterien für die Einordnung von CNO als „Anwendung bewaffneter Gewalt“ (im Sinne des *ius in bello*) vorgestellt werden, wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht, einschließlich der über hundert Jahre alten Prinzipien und Regelungen des Neutralitätsrechts, auf CNO anwendbar ist. Zugleich wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht hierbei einen humanitären Schutzstandard bietet, der demjenigen gleicht, der bei der Anwendung konventioneller Waffen gilt.\n## Riassunto – Computer Network Operations e il diritto dei conflitti armati\nLa rete internet è divenuta il più importante mezzo di comunicazione ed informazione dell’era contemporanea. Ciò determina una sostanziale dipendenza dal corretto funzionamento dei sistemi di comunicazione basati su tale rete, specialmente per ciò che concerne quelli di sostegno ad infrastrutture critiche. Vista la scarsa sicurezza della comunicazione via internet, la vulnerabilità dei sistemi informatici è diventata una questione di rilievo per la sicurezza (nazionale o collettiva) di molti stati e per la NATO. La potenziale condotta di ‘Operazioni militari su reti informatiche’ (*Computer Network Operations – CNO*), ovvero operazioni militari difensive o offensive scatenate tramite internet o per altra via informatica, presenta tuttavia talune incertezze dal punto di vista giuridico. Dapprima questo articolo esamina la vera natura delle CNO, mettendo in luce le difficoltà di identificazione e attribuzione di un’azione delittuosa portata avanti nello spazio cibernetico (o mediante quest’ultimo), a danno di un determinato soggetto. Successivamente, dopo aver presentato alcuni criteri guida per una corretta qualificazione delle CNO come un vero e proprio “uso della forza armata” (secondo lo *ius in bello*), l’articolo dimostra che il diritto dei conflitti armati, assieme agli ultra-centenari principi e norme sulla neutralità, trova applicazione\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\nin caso di CNO. Allo stesso modo, lo scritto evidenzia come tali norme offrano un livello di protezione umanitaria comparabile con quello applicabile nel caso di uso di armi convenzionali.\n## Resumen – Operaciones a través de la red informática y Derecho de los Conflictos Armados.\nInternet ha acabado por convertirse en un importante medio de comunicación e información de la era contemporánea. Esto lleva consigo un alto grado de dependencia con respecto a los sistemas de comunicación centrados en la red, especialmente por lo que se refiere a los sistemas que sirven de apoyo a infraestructuras vitales. Vista la escasa seguridad de las comunicaciones a través de internet, la vulnerabilidad de los sistemas de información se ha convertido en una cuestión prioritaria para la seguridad (nacional y colectiva) de muchos Estados así como para la OTAN. Las conductas potenciales que pueden ser objeto de las operaciones a través de la red informática (Computer Network Operations – CNO), como por ejemplo acciones militares tanto ofensivas como defensivas llevadas a cabo a través de internet o de otras redes de información, presentan aspectos interesantes desde el punto de vista jurídico. El presente artículo examina en primer lugar la naturaleza de las CNO y analiza las dificultades que existen para identificar el sistema en el que tiene su origen un ataque y la posterior atribución de una conducta delictiva llevada a cabo en el espacio cibernético (o a través de este último) a un sujeto determinado. Tras la exposición de algunos criterios que permiten calificar las CNO como “uso de fuerza armada” (en el sentido del *ius in bello*), el artículo demuestra que el Derecho de los Conflictos Armados resulta de aplicación a las CNO, incluidos los principios y preceptos ultra-centenarios relativos a la neutralidad. Al mismo tiempo, pone de manifiesto cómo ese Derecho ofrece un nivel de protección humanitaria comparable con el que es de aplicación en el campo del uso de armas convencionales."

Introduction In this day and age, the Internet¹ is one of the most important means of communication and information. During the last 30 years it has gradually become an essential aspect of the economy in a globalized world and plays an indispensable role in, amongst other things, the administrative and judicial systems of technologically developed countries. All in all, critical infrastructure systems in States with high levels of technology dependency are acutely reliant upon reliable and effective operations of Internet based communication systems. Thus, given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to the security, protection and defence of the integrity of computer networks, the vulnerability of these communication systems has become a significant matter of national security to many such States. Accordingly, the current National Security Strategies of the USA², of the United Kingdom³, ¹ The Internet is globally administered by a Californian (US) non-profit, public-benefit corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which, in the framework of a Public Private Partnership, is associated with and reports to the US Department of Commerce (although, according to the information on ICANN’s website, the organisation heavily emphasises its international nature and independence). ICANN bears global responsibility for ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet as well as for coordinating the Internet system of unique identifiers, i.e. for the assignment of IP-address ranges (since 2005 not directly to users but to regional organisations – see infra note 58). It is further responsible for the generic codes and country codes of the Internet top level domain as well as for the management and maintenance of the (secret) Internet root server system (see infra note 122). ICANN is the successor organization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which was executing the above-mentioned tasks directly on behalf of the US Department of Commerce (information available at http://www.icann/org/en/factsheets/factsheet.html; unless indicated otherwise, all URLs cited in the present survey were last visited on 31 November 2010). Originally, it was planned to transform ICANN into an independent organization in October 2006. During the 2nd World Summit on the Information Society, organized by the UN in Tunis in November 2005, it was proposed to submit ICANN (and thus the Internet itself) to management by the UN. The USA rejected this proposal and declared its intent to keep the control over ICANN for the time being (information available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/).\n² The President of the United States of America, National Security Strategy, p. 27 et seq., available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf.\n³ Her Majesty’s Government, A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The National Security Strategy, pp. 11 and 27, available at http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191639.pdf?CID=PDF&amp;PLA=furl&amp;CRE=nationalsecuritystrategy.\n\nand Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defence White Paper,⁴ all seek to address the issue of cyber-attacks. According to NATO’s new Strategic Concept of 19 November 2010, cyber threats are one of the major perils for the security of the Alliance in the future decade.⁵ Similar concerns are reflected in resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly over the last ten years, which regularly mention the integrity of information and communication technology in the context of international security and call for the creation of a global “culture of cyber security”.⁶ Additionally, the emerging threat of the use of ⁴ Federal Ministry of Defence, White Paper 2006 on German Security Policy and the Future of the Bundeswehr (2006), p. 17: “Germany’s political and economic structures as well as its critical infrastructure have become more vulnerable as a result, not least where criminal activities, terrorist acts, or military attacks from or on cyberspace are concerned”; available at http://www.bmvg.de/fileserving/PortalFiles/C1256EF40036B05B/W26UWAMT995INFODE/W%202006%20eng%20DS.pdf.\n⁵ NATO, Strategic Concept For the Defence and Security of The Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Adopted by Heads of State and Government in Lisbon (19 November 2010), §§ 12 and 19, available at http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf. See also NATO, Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon, Lisbon Summit Declaration (20 November 2010), § 40: “Cyber threats are rapidly increasing and evolving in sophistication. In order to ensure NATO’s permanent and unfettered access to cyberspace and integrity of its critical systems, we will take into account the cyber dimension of modern conflicts in NATO’s doctrine and improve its capabilities to detect, assess, prevent, defend and recover in case of a cyber attack against systems of critical importance to the Alliance. We will strive in particular to accelerate NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) to Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2012 and the bringing of all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection. We will use NATO’s defence planning processes in order to promote the development of Allies’ cyber defence capabilities, to assist individual Allies upon request, and to optimize information sharing, collaboration and interoperability. To address the security risks emanating from cyberspace, we will work closely with other actors, such as the UN and the EU, as agreed. We have tasked the Council to develop, drawing notably on existing international structures and on the basis of a review of our current policy, a NATO in-depth cyber defence policy by June 2011 and to prepare an action plan for its implementation”; available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_68828.htm.\n⁶ See the resolutions Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, UN Documents A/53/70 of 4 December 1998, A/54/49 of 1 December 1999, A/55/28 of 20 November 2000, A/56/19 of 29 November 2001, A/57/53 of 22 November 2002, A/58/32 of 8 December 2003, A/59/61 of 3 December 2004, A/60/45 of 8 December 2005, A/61/55 of 6 December 2006, and A/62/17 of 5 December 2007. With regard to the creation of a global culture of cyber security, see the resolutions Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information structures, MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) the Internet for terrorist purposes (cyber terrorism) is currently on the agendas of several international initiatives and programmes.7 Military forces use the Internet for communication purposes and – to a certain extent – as an inherent component of particular weapon systems. Additionally, the Internet offers the possibility for offensive and/or defensive military actions by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. The military term “Computer Network Operations” (CNO) refers, generally speaking, to computer hacking and back-hacking in the context of a military operation.\nWorldwide, military forces are preparing for the fight in cyberspace. It has been alleged that Israeli armed forces have engaged in CNO activities since the early 1990s.8 The USA established a US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in Fort Meade, Maryland on 23 June 2009 (operational as of October 2010) which unified the already existing cyber capabilities of the US National Security Agency and several US military services (Army Forces Cyber Command, 24th US Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command).9 According to media reports, Belgium10, Germany11, South Korea12 (allegedly in reaction to respective North Korean endeavours), and the UN Documents A/55/63 of 4 December 2000, A/56/121 of 19 December 2001, A/57/239 of 20 December 2002, and A/58/199 of 23 December 2003.\n\nUnited Kingdom (Government Communications Headquarters)¹³ have established similar commands in 2009, while China¹⁴ did so in 2010.¹⁵ Undeniably, CNO have become an important weapon, means or method of warfare extending the – traditionally clearly defined – battlefield to the global cyberspace. Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n¹³ See C.

The Nature and Significance of CNO In the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).\n## 1. Forms and Effects of CNO The concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA).\nThe above-mentioned components of CNO are strongly interrelated. An adversary’s CNA can help one’s own CND when analysed appropriately. A CNE cannot be conducted without CNA, as the information to be gathered by CNE will mostly be protected by firewalls, passwords and other barriers that are erected to prevent an adversarial CNA. Finally, CNA cannot be conducted without CNE, as without information gathering on the targeted network’s architecture and systems the CNA would effectively be conducted blindly.\nWhile the practical value of the taxonomy of CND/CNE/CNA therefore is questionable, it will be presented in more detail below as most academic writings and media reports refer to this classification.\n## A. CND CND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) one’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone).¹⁶ The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies,¹⁷ merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA.\n## B. CNE According to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”.¹⁸ This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage.\nAccording to open source reports, the vast majority of CNO activities conducted during peacetime consist of CNE. For example, already in 2007, the British intelligence service MI5 warned all financial service providers and companies in Great Britain against concerted cyber espionage endeavours by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.¹⁹ In summer 2007, the computer systems of Germany’s Federal Chancellery as well as those of some federal ministries were infected with spyware (i.e. espionage software) reported to have originated from China.²⁰ According to the Annual Report 2009 of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, computer systems of Germany’s federal and state governments and of private businesses were targeted by hundreds of (successful and/or unsuccessful) CNE. Foreign intelligence MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) services were likely to be the organizers of, or are involved in, most of these.²¹ In the USA, over 100 foreign intelligence services currently endeavour to intrude computer systems located in the country, as the US Deputy Secretary of Defence stated in September 2010.²² NATO’s computer networks are also subject to constant – and partly successful – CNE.²³ There is no open source information as to the employment of CNE during an armed conflict. However, it can be assumed that CNE is very likely to be used in support of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance.\n## C. CNA CNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”.²⁴ These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware²⁵). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks.\nRelatively harmless, data modification in the course of a CNA can modify and deface a website (defacement). This is often conducted by hackers who wish to express their political view (hacktivism). Another widely spread form of CNA is the Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) (DDoS-attack),²⁶ which can cause delays in the data transfer process, the denial of access to computer systems or servers (e.g. the targeted websites or a email service) or result in the (only temporary) disabling of the targeted systems. The particular DDoS-techniques are as diverse as the – partly very effective – countermeasures²⁷ developed since 2000.\nHowever, the deletion or modification of data in a successfully intruded computer network can be more hazardous. Hackers can generate wrong information, for instance in the military environment the content of electronically transmitted orders, plans and maps or the localization data of military targets contained in a targeting-database.\nMoreover, it is possible that a CNA could – indirectly – cause death, physical injury or physical destruction of property. As far as chemical plants, nuclear power stations, oil refinery installations, gas store installations or electrical power distribution installations have or rely on computer-based control systems, these systems could be penetrated and manipulated. Thus, a CNA could cause the explosion of a nuclear power plant if the cooling systems were disabled via remote control. The same applies to computer-based control systems of transportation systems. By manipulation of the rail points, train derailments or collisions could be caused; penetration and minimal amendments to the programming of an air traffic control system could result in aircraft incidents. Therefore, the classification of CNO as a non-lethal weapon, as asserted by some scholars,²⁸ has to be challenged in this regard. Also, the general assertion made that CNO, in its current form would generally not violate LOAC, is questionable.²⁹ Above all, CNA can affect the functioning of a State, when manipulating or deleting data in computer systems of critical infrastructure systems. The list of critical infrastructure systems will slightly differ from State to State. By way of example, the following areas identified by the German Federal Office of Security of Information Technology (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) can be considered as critical infrastructure systems:³⁰ transportation and traffic (postal services, local traffic, roads, rail system, aviation, sea and inland navigation); energy (nuclear plants, distribution and transfer systems of electricity, oil, gas); hazardous substances (chemical and biological agents, nuclear reactors); information and telecommunication technology; finance, currency and insurance (banks, insurance companies, financial service providers, stock markets); public utilities (health, emergency and rescue sector, disaster control, food and water supply, waste management); government, administration, justice, police, customs and armed forces.\nMany of these critical infrastructure systems are based on computer-based control systems, such as the generation and distribution of electricity or telecommunications. Some function entirely on the basis of an Internet connection, including the banking and stock exchange systems. Other areas are increasingly reliant on the Internet, for example the so-called e-justice and e-government. In any technologically highly developed, post-industrial State most of the critical infrastructure systems can be deemed to depend on the operability and efficiency of electronic data transfer. The devastating effects and the subsequent disruption of the ordre public caused by a CNA are limited only by the imagination of the reader. Therefore, cyber security plays a paramount role for the national security of many States and was noted as one of the major perils for the Alliance's security in NATO's Strategic Concept of 2010 (see supra I).\nThere is open source information available in the media on CNA being conducted during peacetime.\nThe only publicly known case, in which the attribution of a CNA to a particular State can be asserted, was the penetration and temporary disabling of Syrian air defence networks, especially the radar systems, by Israel on 6 September 2007, immediately followed by an airstrike by Israel's Air Force destroying Syria's Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Deir-Az-Zur.³¹ ³⁰ See the list of critical infrastructure systems, available at https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/Publikationen/Faltblaetter/F17KritischeInfrastruktur.html.\n³¹ Ben-David, supra note 8.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) A more prominent case of a successful CNA against a State are the DDoS-attacks launched against several critical infrastructure systems in Estonia during the 27 April – 18 May 2007 timeframe. The “attacks”³² targeted websites and communication channels of the government and commercial services.³³ For example, the web-services of the major banks Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank were (at one-time) interrupted for 1,5 hours;³⁴ the website of a governing coalition party was defaced;³⁵ emergency phone numbers were disengaged for a short time;³⁶ and three major Estonian Internet Service Providers and some online news providers were disconnected (although it is unclear for how long).³⁷ The estimated physical (because of the disengagement of emergency phone numbers) and economic damage caused by the DDoS-attacks remains unclear. The attacks most probably originated from the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the relatively simple DDoS-methods and the political context of the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, it is asserted that the “attackers” were politically motivated private persons (hacktivism).³⁸ Another example of successful CNA during peacetime are the defacement and DDoS-attacks launched against Lithuania between 28 June and 1 July 2008. The CNA may have been connected either to the amendment of Lithuania’s laws to prohibit the display of symbols of the Soviet Union or the singing of its anthem in public³⁹ or to the unilateral veto⁴⁰ against discussions on an EU energy partnership deal with Russian Federation. Over 300 Lithuanian websites were defaced, including those of the Government.⁴¹ Given the pro-Russian contents of the defacement, as well as the subject of the (unsolicited) spam emails “Hackers United against external threats to Russia”, the CNA is assumed to have originated with nationalistic, private hacker groups (hacktivism).42 On the contrary, the “Conficker” worm, reported to have been created by Russian criminals, was not aimed at State structures, as it spread worldwide, affecting both private and official networks. It did gain national interest of the victim States, when it began to affect governmental and military computer systems, including those of the British Parliament,43 and the French and British air forces and navies.44 The worm “Stuxnet”, which affected over 100.000 computer systems worldwide between June and September 2010, targeted industrial control systems of gas pipelines and power plants based on Siemens software, aiming to establish remote control of the systems and to hide any changes in the computer systems from the operators of the equipment.45 As the vast majority of the infections affected Iran’s critical infrastructure systems, in particular of the nuclear power plant near Bushehr, and the worm’s reach and complexity obviously required enormous personnel and budgetary investments as well as a considerable amount of time to write the code (in secrecy), the involvement of a foreign organization or State is suspected.46 Although there is no respective open source information, it must be assumed that, in the past, CNA were also successfully launched against NATO’s computer systems. The *Analysis and Recommendations of the Group of Experts on a New Strategic Concept for NATO* presented on 17 May 2010 noted: “Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern”.⁴⁷ Furthermore, CNA were conducted during times of armed conflict, as for example during *Operation Allied Force*⁴⁸ (24 March – 10 June 1999) launched by 10 NATO Member States⁴⁹ against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the beginning of the operation, websites and the mailing system of NATO were blocked and infected by a virus (Melissa), apparently originating in Serbia.⁵⁰ Furthermore, some defacement attacks were launched by politically motivated individuals (hacktivism) from Serbia and Russia (*Black Hand, From Russia with Love, Russian Hacker Union*, etc.) against websites of NATO and NATO Member States.⁵¹ Equally, some hackers groups (politically) supporting the NATO operation (e.g. *Dutchthreat* or *Kosovo Hackers Group*) tried to infiltrate the governmental websites of Yugoslavia.⁵² Moreover, it is suspected that the President of the USA, *Bill Clinton*, did authorize the *Central Intelligence Agency* (CIA) to penetrate the computer systems of banks in Greece, Lebanon, Russia and Cyprus in order to clear the banking accounts of the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia *Slobodan Milošević*.⁵³ As the respective plans are said to have been ‘Foreign-made’ ‘Stuxnet’ Computer Virus’, *The Washington Post* online of 27 September 2010, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092706229.html.\n⁴⁷ NATO, *NATO 2020: Assured Security, Dynamic Engagement.

Bendrath, ‘Der Kosovo-Krieg im Cyberspace’, *heise online* of 19 July 1999, available at http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/6/6449/1.html.\n⁵² *Id.* ⁵³ See ‘Serbs Flee Yugoslavia’, *BBC News* online of 25 May 1999, available at http:// MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) objected within the US-Congress due to possible diplomatic friction and potential loss of trust in regard to the international banking system, it remains unclear whether the CNO was conducted.⁵⁴ Also, in the weeks before and during the course of the five-day hostilities between the Russian Federation and Georgia (South Ossetia) which started on 8 August 2008, significant CNO were launched against Georgia.⁵⁵ Those were DDoS-attacks and defacements mainly directed against Georgian government websites but also the web portals of Georgia’s National Bank and news agencies, partly resulting in shutting down the website servers for hours or days.⁵⁶ Although suspicions of the – officially disclaimed – involvement of the Russian Federation in the cyber incidents remain, these incidences were allegedly attributed to the criminal organization “Russian Business Network” (hosting and renting illegal web services).⁵⁷ In regard to the aforementioned armed conflicts, it can be inferred that the conduct of CNO did partly influence the perception of the conflict in the public, but not its overall outcome. It can be assumed that also in the near future CNO are very likely to be used merely in support of a conventional military operation, mainly military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, or in order to influence the perception of a particular political conflict in the online media.\n## 2. Identification of the Origin and Attribution of Malicious CNO It will always be difficult to unequivocally identify the computer systems that malicious CNO originated from and to attribute the attack to a certain entity, group or a State.\nA cyber attack is distinguished by its rapidness. As soon as the attack is completed, the tracing of the data stream (so-called back-tracing) and news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/352059.stm; ‘CIA Ordered to Topple Milosevic’, BBC News online of 6 July 1999, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/387463. stm; and F. Rötzer, ‘CIA im Crackerkrieg gegen Milosevich?’, heise online of 24 May 1999, available at http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/2/2874/1.html.\n⁵⁴ Id.\n⁵⁵ See Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, Report, Vol. II., pp. 217 et seq., available at http://www.ceig.ch/pdf/IIFFMCG_Volume_II.pdf; and J. Markoff, ‘Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks’, The New York Times online of 13 August 2008, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=2&amp;em.\n⁵⁶ For more details, see id.\n⁵⁷ Id.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) thus the identification of the originating computer system are highly improbable. It is highly unlikely that hackers will leave any tangible evidence, for example in the protocols of the intrusion detection systems of the attacked network, as such evidence in these protocols is easy to delete once the network is penetrated.\nMoreover, and further aggravating the issue, a cyber-attack can be conducted “anonymously”, for example by using one of the (often) free of charge anonymisation services offered on the Internet which would hide the unique characteristics of the hackers’ computer system. These unique characteristics are the so-called IP address⁵⁸ as well as other technical data⁵⁹ a computer sends while connected to the Internet.\n⁵⁸ An IP address (Internet Protocol number) is a twelve digit number, which identifies a computer or another network device during an Internet session. An IP data package is the basic element of data transmission via the Internet. It comprises: a header (containing information on the source, destination, status and fragmentation of the transmitted data) and a payload (containing the transmitted data). At the very beginning of the Internet, the IANA (see supra note 1) assigned static IP addresses, i.e. IP addresses permanently assigned to a particular user, to companies, organizations, universities and also to individuals. The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only. After the particular Internet session the dynamic IP address is assigned to another user and client of the respective Access Provider. At present, the so-called static IP-addresses are only being used for leased Internet-lines of major corporations and other entities.\n⁵⁹ These include: Media Access Control address (MAC address) or – for the operating system Apple – the Airport ID of a computer (order of numbers, which clearly identifies a computer hardware); Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, details on the assignment of a MAC address or Airport ID to an IP address); Service Set Identity (SSID, details on the network name); Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol (WEP, coded details about the network); as well as details on the operating system and its adjustments. These details are – if not blocked – automatically transferred during the Internet session to any computer requesting this information by a so-called PING (Packet InterNet Grouper). A PING is computer software sending an ICMP-Echo-Request data package to the destination address of the host which is to be scanned, i.e. to the IP address, to the Domain Name System name (DNS name) or to the Network Basic Input Output System name (NetBIOS name) of the targeted host. The targeted system automatically responds by an ICMP-Echo-Reply, if – according to the usual adjustments of the system – the system supports the ICMP package.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) Furthermore, the Internet offers possibilities for deception in regard to the identity of the hackers' computer systems. It is perfectly possible to feign someone else's IP address and other technical data (so-called malicious misrepresentation or spoofing) and thus to operate in the Internet under someone else's\"cyber-identity\". The connection to the Internet can also be established via a mobile phone or other device with a feigned identity number. Additionally, the data stream can be conducted through the whole globe via a chain of computers of numerous unsuspecting individuals, if so-called zombie software (partly offered free of charge on the Internet) has been secretly installed on the respective computers by using Trojans. One of these computers could subsequently be misused as the sender of the data stream (so-called remote control). Thus, in the case of a cyber attack, even after a back tracing of the malicious data stream, the victim can seldom be sure as of the identification and geographical location of the computer system the attack originated from.\nAbove all, even if a malicious data stream of a cyber attack would indeed be successfully back-traced to the hackers' computer systems, it will – highly probable – remain unproven which individuals of which citizenship and on who's orders were operating the systems identified. Therefore, the attribution of a cyber attack to a certain individual, group, entity or State will most probably be based on unproven suspicions or indications only.\nConsequently, it will be very unlikely to recognize at first sight – and probably even after detailed technical analysis – whether the attack was conducted by a mischievous teenager, by a criminal (including a terrorist), by a group with extremist or terrorist background or by the adversary Party in an armed conflict.\nThese uncertainties will surely add to the complexity of both the legal analysis of a cyber attack and the victim's decision on choosing a subsequent course of action. Considering the difficulty in identifying and locating the hackers' computer systems and – most importantly – attributing the attack, in most cases it will remain in doubt whether national police forces and public prosecutors or, in the framework of international judicial cooperation, the police forces and public prosecutors of a foreign State, or the armed forces (in the case the attack occurs during an already existing armed conflict and is believed to have originated with a party to the armed conflict, or in the case the effects of the cyber-attack are comparable to a conventional armed attack and trigger the right to self-defence) retain main responsibility to deal with the case.\n## 3. CNO in Modern Warfare The significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations is manifold.\nWhilst most armed conflicts in this day and age are occurring in regions that are technologically less sophisticated (e.g. Afghanistan, Sudan or Chad), this does not result in the irrelevance of the Internet and of CNO. It must be taken into consideration that, in regard to communication abilities and collection of open source information, the parties to armed conflicts in less well developed regions are also essentially dependent on – aside from radio traffic – wireless Internet connectivity, as other communication and information systems (e.g. telecommunication media, print media, telephone lines) are often non-existent.\nIt is especially evident in the context of so-called asymmetric warfare and in the hands of non-state actors, for instance terrorists, that CNO can be a powerful weapon, primarily against post-industrial States and their potent armed forces. More than ever, post-industrial States have technologically highly developed armed forces at their disposal, which correspondingly react most sensitively to technical disorder. It is the dependence on the technology which makes them extremely vulnerable to a cyber attack.\nAs CNO can be conducted from any place in the world by as little as a few experts and, in addition, are extraordinarily inexpensive when compared with conventional military operations, they offer a particularly practical and extremely powerful\"weapon\". Therefore, all aspects of CNO (see supra II.1) show an increasing significance in the context of national as well as of international security.\nAs the Head of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Co-ordination Centre stated already in 2008:\"Cyber war can become a very effective global problem because it is low-risk, low-cost, highly effective and easily globally deployable. It is almost an ideal weapon that nobody can ignore\".60 MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) ## III. Legal Analysis of CNO Although some scholars plead for a general prohibition of CNO, currently such a ban does not exist.⁶¹ However, many international and domestic legal restrictions do apply to CNO – a fact which makes a legal analysis a complex undertaking.\nApart from the fundamental principle of public international law, namely the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations, a number of specific areas of public international law may apply to CNO. As data packages pass through the territory of several States when sent via the Internet, the provisions of territorial sovereignty must be considered. Also, data manipulations might – under certain circumstances – be judged as intervention in domestic affairs of a State, which would be considered illegal under public international law. Further, because satellite technology is involved, space law and especially treaties relating to satellites must be considered. As CNO can interfere with telecommunication systems and always result in data amendments in the working storage of the attacked computer system, both international telecommunications law and international copyright law (in regard to software) require a thorough analysis. In case human rights treaty law is generally applicable, their respective provisions must be considered, especially in regard to secrecy of correspondence, telecommunications and data protection, as well as to the right to receive and impart information and ideas. Restraints for CNO can further result from the provisions of diplomatic and consular law, whenever diplomatic or consular computer systems are involved. Furthermore, it has been asserted that international environmental law principles of good neighbourhood and of the prevention of significant trans-boundary harm would be applicable to CNO in analogy.⁶² In addition, the provisions of ⁶¹ A. D’Amato pleads for a general prohibition of CNO, emphasizing that the stability of the international community depends on the free flow of information (p. 68) and that every nation has a vital interest in the operationability of the Internet (p. 69), see A. D’Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’, in M.N. Schmitt &amp; B.T. O’Donnell (eds.), *Computer Network Attack and International Law* (Newport / Rhode Island, US Naval War College, 2002), pp. 59–71, pp. 67–69. See also: T. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position. Viewing Information Warfare as Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’, Vol. 30 *Case Western Reserve* J.I.L. 1998, p. 600.\n⁶² Such assertion is made – emphasizing that the Internet is a global resource comparable to the natural environment – by T. Stein &amp; T. Marauhn, ‘Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen’, Vol. 60 *Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht* 2000, p. 21. A similar approach REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) respective national law systems, especially constitutional and criminal law, must always be taken into consideration.\nGiven the variety of areas of law involved and the limited scope of this survey, the following remarks will be restricted to the analysis of LOAC, focusing on the provisions of the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Annex to the Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (HR), the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GC) and their Additional Protocols I (AP I) and II (AP II) (2). However, first of all, it must be examined under which conditions LOAC applies to CNO (1).\n## 1. The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict According to common Article 2 of the GCs, LOAC applies to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.\nIn practice, armed conflicts surely can be considered as the main case of application of LOAC. Pursuant to the prevailing opinion an is taken by the (non-binding) OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems of 1992, which call for cooperation of States (Principle 6) in the area of comprehensive protection of information systems (Principle 4), and which stipulate an imperative of deliberation in the use of information systems (Principle 3), see OECD Doc. OCDE/GD(92)190. However, an analogous application of international environmental law provisions is not convincing because of the lack of an “unintended omission” or of the absence of regulation. International telecommunication law, in particular the provisions of the (almost universally ratified) Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) of 22 December 1992, binds ITU Member States to far-reaching obligations in regard to the protection of communication and information systems (see in particular Articles 6, 33, 38, 45 and 47 of the ITU Constitution).\n These are: Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949; Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949; Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) international armed conflict occurs when one or more States have recourse to “armed force” against another State, regardless of the legality, reasons or the intensity of this confrontation.⁶⁶ This opinion is confirmed by the Commentary on the GC which states that “any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2”.⁶⁷ Art. 1(4) AP I extends the definition of international armed conflict to include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination.⁶⁸ A non-international armed conflict within the meaning of the common Article 3 GCs occurs when one or more non-governmental organized armed groups are involved and the situation reaches a certain threshold of confrontation, distinguishing it from internal disturbances, riots or acts of banditry (see also Art. 1 AP II).⁶⁹ Thus, a situation of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and consequently the application of LOAC is given, when States or – under certain circumstances – organized armed groups use “armed force” against the other Party.\nUnsurprisingly, LOAC is applicable to all CNO conducted either in support of conventional military operations carried out in the event of an already ongoing armed conflict or conducted as the first step preparing the immediate start of conventional military operations altogether comprising an armed conflict.\nWhether “cyber war”, i.e. military operations conducted exclusively by the means of the Internet or other computer networks without the employment of other weaponry (in the following referred to as: “isolated” CNO), will ever per se be classified as “use of armed force” and thus comprise an armed conflict, depends on future State practice.

What REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) question, the following remarks will show criteria useful for the assessment whether particular types of “isolated” CNO constitute an armed conflict (A.). Furthermore, it will be analysed how the ius in bello terms “attack”, “act of violence” and “hostilities” apply to CNO (B.).\n## A. “Isolated” CNO as Armed Conflict As stated above, an (international or non-international) armed conflict occurs when States or – under certain circumstances – (a State and/or) organized armed group(s) use “armed force” against each other.\nOf course, the notion of “use of armed force” – indicating that differences and confrontations did indeed reach the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and thus trigger the applicability of the ius in bello – is to be distinguished from the term “use of (armed)” force pursuant to Article 2(4) UN Charter, although the two terms are closely related. Whenever a State conducts actions considered as a “use of armed force” in the meaning of ius ad bellum against another State, this indicates the outbreak of hostilities reaching the level of “use of force” in the meaning of ius in bello and thus the threshold of an armed conflict triggering the applicability of LOAC – with the possible exception of quick, discrete and “surgical” use of force in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter without further retort by the victim (as e.g. the bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osirak/Iraq by Israeli Air Force in 1981).\nIn the following, criteria for the assessment whether a particular type of “isolated” CNO constitutes an armed conflict will be developed. The question whether a certain type of CNO can be deemed as “use of armed Targets? What Rules of Engagement?”, in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 434; see also the remarks by L. Doswald-Beck, 'Some Thoughts on Computer Network Attack and the International Law of Armed Conflict', in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 165.\n\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning) will be examined (while – apart from the above stated exception – exactly the same criteria can indicate whether “use of force” in the meaning of the *ius ad bellum* is given). However, most academic writings on CNO do refer to “use of armed force” in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter. References to such writings will be made when useful and appropriate in the discussion of the term “use of armed force” in the *ius in bello* meaning.\nAccording to the traditional understanding, the assumption is that the “use of armed force” requires the employment of kinetic weaponry; that is the employment of a tool designed to cause kinetic effects of physical nature on a body or on an object. CNO are usually neither designed nor intended to directly cause kinetic effects. The transfer of data and its delay or interruption, as well as the manipulation, suppression or deletion of data cannot be deemed to cause kinetic effects in the common meaning of the term. Therefore, a significant qualitative difference between CNO and conventional weapons can be identified. In contrast, some similarities between CNO and biological or chemical weapons (hereinafter referred to as BC weapons) can be conceived. The use of BC weapons does not cause destruction in conventional sense, because these weapons do not set free any kinetic energy.72 The employment of BC weapons is considered as a form of “use of armed force” because, although not resulting in physical destruction of material, these weapons are employed in order to cause death or injury to living things.73 Thus, in the case of BC weapons, the term “weapon” is defined with reference to their effects rather than their method, which perfectly corresponds with the effects-based approach inherent to public international law. Consequently, the majority of scholars rightly insist on an effects-based interpretation of the term of “use of armed force” in the context of CNO.74 Therefore, in the following, different categories of potential effects which can be caused by CNO will be illustrated in order to determine when CNO must be deemed as “use of armed force”.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) i. Death, Physical Injury and/or Destruction of Property According to the nearly uniform opinion among scholars (to which the author of the present survey subscribes), a CNO – similarly to the effects caused by BC weapons – should be considered as “use of armed force” if it results in death, physical injury or the destruction of property.75 As illustrated above (II.1.C), CNO can indirectly76 cause such effects.\nAccording to a minority view amongst scholars, a CNO, even if it indirectly causes death, physical injury or the destruction of property, qualifies as “use of armed force” only if at the same time it amounts to a “use of structural force”.77 “Structural force” is described in the public international law literature as a physical incursion into a State’s M.N. Schmitt proposes a catalogue of criteria indicating that CNO constitute “use of force”: - severity of the effects, i.e. threat of physical injury or destruction of property, - immediacy of the occurrence of the negative consequences, - direct nexus between the CNO and the negative consequences caused, - invasiveness of the consequences on foreign territory, - measurability of the consequences, - pre-assumption of illegitimacy of the CNO according to national rules and to the International Public Law, based on the prima facie illegitimacy of the use of force in international relations (the author of the present survey only guesses that the term “illegitimacy” indeed stands for “illegality”).\nSee Schmitt, supra note 28, pp. 65 et seq. This approach is not convincing because of the circular reasoning it contains. It cannot be decided whether a particular act is indeed illegal, by the simultaneous assertion of the illegality of the same act.\n\nterritory without the employment of conventional or mass destruction weapons, leaving the attacked State the “use of armed force” as the only option open for effective self-defence (e.g. in the case of intentional spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing widespread flooding).78 Thus, “structural force” is deemed as “use of armed force” in the sense of Article 2 (4) UN Charter if it has the same effect as an “armed attack” triggering the right to self-defence pursuant to Article 51 UN Charter.79 However, it must be considered that there is a significant qualitative difference between “use of armed force” and an “armed attack”. According to the prevailing opinion among public international law scholars and the settled jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, an “armed attack” only occurs when the “use of armed force” reaches a certain level of intensity in regard to its effects and scale.80 When this threshold of intensity is not reached, the respective actions in question can still be considered as “use of armed force”, although they do not constitute an “armed attack”.81 Therefore, the above presented view asserting that CNO can only be deemed as “use of force” when it comprises “structural force”, and thus setting the terms of “use of armed force” and “armed attack” equal, is highly questionable.\nFurthermore, some scholars demand additional criteria to be met in order to classify CNO as “use of armed force”. This is the direct nexus between the CNO and physical damage, the immediacy of the occurrence of the physical damage (in the sense that the occurrence of the damage does not depend on any additional factors) as well as whether the damage can be foreseen at all.82 However, these criteria determine the conditions of attribution of the damage to a certain action, and are therefore not relevant for the specification of the term “use of armed force”.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) ## ii. Destruction of Data Some academic writings assert that the destruction of data of substantial importance and/or of significant economical value should be considered as “use of armed force”.83 But, in consequence, it would need to have been ascertained in every particular case whether indeed data of some economic value has been destroyed or whether the CNO is to be considered as trivial because the compromised or deleted data is of little or no value. In addition, it must be considered that in the case of a so-called DoS attack84 data will not be destroyed but rather its use and information value will be diminished by delay of its transmission or by temporary denial of access to the data. Furthermore, the effect of CNO directed against data only is not comparable to the effects of conventional weapons, for example a bombardment, or of BC weapons. Therefore, the above presented view is not convincing, as it is of little practical value and could lead to unbearable results.\nOther scholars assert that at least the destruction of data symbolizing an asset (e.g. data of an electronically operated banking account) should be considered as “use of armed force”.85 They suggest that this assessment would reflect the obligation to protect civilian objects from dangers arising from military operations.86 However, electronic assets, accounts, demands or claims cannot be equated with objects or physical property and their destruction cannot be compared with the destructive effects on physical property caused by conventional (or BC) weapons. Therefore, the opinion presented above does not capture accurately the translation of the traditional understanding of the term “use of armed force” into the “cyberspace”.\nIf, however, a CNO was to be directed against the whole economic or banking system as one of the critical infrastructures of a State, the situation must be judged differently (see III.1.A.v. on critical infrastructure systems).\n## iii. “Theft” of Data Moreover, it is asserted that the “theft” of particular data should be considered as “use of armed force”, if information of vital interest to MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) a State, for instance classified information, is compromised.⁸⁷ Also the “theft” of all data of military nature (regardless of the classification) should be considered as “use of armed force”.⁸⁸ However, the “theft” of data (CNE) merely represents a kind of modern espionage which is not generally forbidden under public international law.⁸⁹ All in all, “theft” of data – even classified data of importance to the military – cannot be deemed as having similar effects as conventional or BC weapons and therefore cannot be judged as “use of armed force”. Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict.\niv. Massive Disruption of Military C3-Systems Additionally, some scholars assert that the destruction⁹⁰ or medium to long-term disruption⁹¹ of military command, control and communication systems (C3-systems) is to be deemed as “use of armed force”. Indeed, the intended outcome, namely the disruption of military communications and the consequent restraining ability on military command and control, can be achieved both through the physical destruction of respective systems by conventional weapons and through the massive disruption of the systems by malicious CNO. As such, the effect of a corresponding CNO is quite comparable to the effects of the employment of conventional weapons. This view is supported by Article VI of the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities concluded between the USA and the Soviet Union on 12 June 1989.⁹² According to this provision, the disruption of command and control systems (C2), resulting even in a mere restraint of those systems, would be regarded as a dangerous military activity. Given the political context of the agreement the provision indicates that a – massive – disruption of ⁸⁷ Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846, 855; contra: Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 10.\n⁸⁸ Joyner &amp; Lotrione, supra note 75, pp. 846 and 856.\n⁸⁹ D’Amato, supra note 61, p. 67; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 32 with further references. In regard to CNO as a modern form of espionage see: von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 134. Apart from the penalisation of espionage resulting from respective national law systems, spying is restrained by certain provisions of public international law, e.g. the taboos stated by the diplomatic and consular law protecting diplomatic and consular archives and correspondence, i.e. respective electronic databases and communication via the Internet.\n⁹⁰ See M. Bothe, ‘Völkerrechtliche Verhinderung von Gewalt (ius contra bellum)’, in W. Graf Vitzthum, Völkerrecht (Berlin, De Gruyter, 2001), Section 8, § 10.\n⁹¹ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8. See also Sharp, supra note 75, p. 129, who recognizes the right to self-defence against an attack on computer networks of “vital interest” to a State.\n⁹² Vol. 28 I.L.M. 1989, pp. 877 et seq.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) military C3-systems could indeed be seen by States as “use of force”.\n## v. Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems There is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems⁹³ by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]”⁹⁴ This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.\nHowever, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment.⁹⁵ This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems.⁹⁶ It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing ⁹³ See supra section II.1.C.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n⁹⁵ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n⁹⁶ Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599. See also Sharp, supra note 75, pp. 129 et seq. Contra: Dinstein, supra note 75, p. 105; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8, who demand the occurrence of physical damage outside the targeted computer networks in order to qualify CNO as use of force.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) similar effects on critical infrastructure systems would be considered as “use of armed force”.\nvi. Intermediate Result All in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities” As far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\n\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).\n## A. Prohibited Methods and Means of Warfare ### i. Perfidy Article 23(f) HR in conjunction with Articles 38 and 39 AP I as well as Article 12 AP II prohibit the misuse of distinctive emblems, signs, signals or flags of protected entities¹⁰¹, including those of the Red Cross and its associated entities and of the United Nations. Furthermore, the provisions ban the misuse of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Party to the particular armed conflict as well as of the adversary Party (though, in regard to the latter only while engaging in attack or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations).¹⁰² Moreover, Article 44(3) AP I states the obligation for all members of the armed forces to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.\nAlthough the above-mentioned provisions refer to physically visible symbols carried by individuals or objects, the rules can also be observed in the\"cyberspace\". The spirit and purpose of these provisions is to preserve the neutrality of certain entities and to protect certain groups against dangers arising from military operations. Therefore, Parties to an armed conflict must not misuse the identity of these entities or groups. Consequently, the\"cyber identity\"(i.e. website, e-mail address, email header, IP address and other technical data sent while connected to the Internet) of one of the protected organisations or groups must not be used at any time during the conduct of CNO. A simple example of the ban would be that the header of an e-mail sent to adversary armed forces, containing a virus, indirectly causing physical damage outside the targeted network, must not show, for instance, the Red Cross as the ¹⁰¹ Also see the Annex I to the AP I.\n¹⁰² Exceptions to those rules are stated in Article 39(3) AP I in regard to espionage and to the conduct of armed conflict at sea.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) sender. Also, while hacking adversary computer networks, the CNO forces must not feign technical data, which would lead to presumption of the “cyber identity” of a civilian if the concrete CNO conducted is to be considered as an “attack” or an “act preparatory to an attack” in the meaning of Article 44(3) AP I. Moreover, any respective manipulation of websites belonging to the protected entities would be illegal.\nIn addition, the prohibition of Article 23(b) HR in conjunction with Article 37(1) AP I, to kill, injure or capture an adversary under recourse to perfidy, applies to CNO. In general terms, perfidy describes an act which leads the adversary to erroneously believe that he or she is entitled to, or is obliged to accord protection under LOAC (see the definition of perfidy in Article 37(1) AP I). The ban covers, inter alia, intentional dissemination of misinformation to the adversary Party about the intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender, or about an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, as well as feigning civilian, non-combatant or protected status (e.g. of a United Nations employee or of a member of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, by using respective emblems, signs, signals or uniforms, see Art. 23(f) HR and Art. 37(1) AP I). The aforementioned misinformation can generally be transmitted by the means of the Internet, for example by e-mail or as a statement on a website. As already stated (e.g. supra II.2.), the “cyber-identity” of the aforementioned protected persons can easily be feigned in the “cyberspace”. However, the above described dissemination of misinformation or feigning of the (cyber) identity of a protected person is prohibited only if it directly¹⁰³ results in the death, injury or capture of the adversary.\nConversely, legal ruses of war in the sense of Article 24 HR and Article 37(2) AP I, which are merely aimed to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly, offer a broad field of application to CNO. Thus, it is imaginable that a Party to an armed conflict establishes a so-called honey net around its own computer network, i.e. an outside-network building a buffer around its own computer network, which is only minimally protected against hacking and, technically speaking, ¹⁰³ The specific nexus between the dissemination of misinformation or feigning of a protected status on the one hand and the death, injury or capture of the adversary on the other hand is required in order to establish accountability of armed forces, as – in the traditional understanding of warfare – all military actions always pursue death, injury or capture of the adversary, see M. Bothe, K.J. Partsch &amp; W.A. Solf, *New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts. Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949* (The Hague / Boston / London, Martinus Nijhoff, 1982), Art. 37 (1) AP I, no. 2.4, p. 204.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) appears perfectly realistic, but contains false information, for example on planned military operations or on the status of own forces and their location. Such a honey net could be established specifically in the hope that the adversary Party would compromise it and – in this way – obtain false information.\n## ii. Methods or Means of Warfare Prohibited Because of the Nature of Their Effects Some methods or means of warfare are prohibited because of the nature of their effects.\nAccording to Article 51(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. This ban refers to the dissemination of certain information to the civilian population. As this information could be easily transmitted by means of computer-based information systems, for example via e-mail or as information on a website, this prohibition must be considered during the planning and the conduct of CNO.\nFurthermore, Article 23(e) HR, Article 35(2) AP I, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980 and its Protocols¹⁰⁴ as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 prohibit the employment of methods or means of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Equally, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57(2)(a)(iii) AP I stipulate that an attack which may be expected to cause loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. As it is perfectly possible that a cyber attack could indirectly cause physical damage (see supra II.1.C), it must be examined beforehand whether the anticipated (indirect) effect would be excessive in the sense of the above-mentioned provisions.¹⁰⁵ In this regard, as the expected effects of concrete CNO ¹⁰⁴ Those are: Protocol on Non-Detectable Fragments (Protocol I) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III) of 1980, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV) of 1995, and Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V) of 2003.\n¹⁰⁵ See E.T. Jensen, ‘Unexpected Consequences from Knock-Out Effects: A Different MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) are to be assessed, the practical criteria for the examination resemble to ones for the analysis of the effects caused by other (e.g. conventional) weapons.\nMoreover, according to Article 51(4) AP I indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Attacks are deemed to be indiscriminate, when they are not or cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or when their effects cannot be limited (see Art. 51(4)(a)-(c) AP I). It is perfectly possible that CNO equated to an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello) or an “act of violence” (see III.1.B.) could have indiscriminate effects, in the case of global, uncontrolled spreading of viruses, bugs and – in future – micro-mechanical organisms via the Internet. However, damaging software could be programmed in such a way so as to only target computer systems with specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. An uncontrolled spread of malware, as well as any cascade effects, could be easily prevented by appropriate programming.\nHowever, the vast majority of malicious CNO will not achieve the quality of a “method or means of combat, the effects of which are indiscriminate”. The inductive conclusion drawn from the examples given by Articles 51(4)(a) and (b) AP I shows that the provisions refer to methods or means of combat which result in physically “devastating” physical effects.\nFinally, Article 35(3) in connection with Article 55(1) AP I prohibits the employment of methods or means of warfare which may be expected to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. This provision covers only especially extensive, intensive and long-lasting environmental damage, which exceeds the scale of both the quality and quantity of “ordinary” environmental damage which is expected to occur in the course of combat.[108] Severe damage of the natural environment can always be caused when dangerous forces are set free, such as by radiation escaping from a nuclear power plant, the explosion of a chemical or pharmacy installation, or the breaking of a dam or dyke. As such effects could be caused indirectly by CNO Standard for Computer Network Operations?', Vol. 18 American University LL.Rev. 2003, pp. 1178 et seq.; and Schmitt, supra note 28, p. 82.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) (see supra II.1.C), the prohibition of Article 35(3) AP I must be also considered for operations primarily conducted within “cyberspace”.\n## B. Prohibited Targets Furthermore, LOAC provisions granting protection for non-combatants and for civilian objects are of significance for CNO.\n### i. Civilians Population and Individual Civilians The civilian population as a whole, as well as individual civilians (see Art. 50 AP I), are protected against “attacks”¹⁰⁹, “acts of violence”¹¹⁰ and “effects of hostilities”¹¹¹. Accordingly, CNO which are not deemed as being “use of force”, and thus not comprising an “attack” (in the meaning of *ius in bello*), “act of violence” or “effect of hostilities” (see supra III.1.B) would not be contrary to LOAC and – from the perspective of international humanitarian law – could legally be directed against civilians¹¹².\nConversely, CNO considered as being a “use of force” could only be directed against civilians launching malicious CNO against the armed forces constituting “direct participation in hostilities” within the meaning of Article 51(3) AP I and Article 13(3) AP II¹¹³. In order to distinguish between private hacking as “direct participation in hostilities” and hacking as a mere criminal act, all circumstances of a specific case must be taken into consideration (see also supra II.2).\nFurthermore, according to Article 48 AP I, the Parties to an armed conflict must, at all times, distinguish between the civilian population ¹⁰⁹ See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52(1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n¹¹⁰ See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Art. 13(2) AP II.\n¹¹¹ See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n¹¹² Concurring: Schmitt, supra note 106, p. 378.\n¹¹³ The examination of the different approaches to the question of the direct participation of civilians in hostilities, and especially of the temporal scope of the loss of protection otherwise granted by international humanitarian law, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further examination, the following literature may be recommended selectively: N. Melzer, *Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities* (Geneva, ICRC, May 2009), available at www.icrc.org; Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 51 AP I, no. 2.4.2.2., p. 303; M.N. Schmitt, ‘Direct Participation in Hostilities and 21st Century Armed Conflict’, in H. Fischer, U. Froissart, W.H. von Heinegg &amp; C. Raap (Hrsg.), *Krisensicherung und humanitärer Schutz – Crisis Management and Humanitarian Protection. Festschrift für Dieter Fleck* (Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), pp. 505–529.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) and combatants. Admittedly, the conventional (visual) criteria for the identification of a combatant as set out in Articles 43 and 44 AP I are not helpful for CNO, during which the acting individuals are not physically visible.¹¹⁴ However, the obligation to distinguish can also be met within “cyberspace”. In the “virtual world”, a computer of a combatant can be distinguished from the computer of a non-combatant according to its IP address and other technical data automatically sent during an Internet session. It can easily be verified by everybody in one of the official WhoIs?¹¹⁵ Internet databases to which person or entity a specific IP address or an IP address range is assigned. In addition, the “owner” and the responsible administrators of websites can be found in the WhoIs? databases. Thus, in principle it can be confirmed whether a particular actor in the “virtual world” should be considered as a member of the armed forces or as a civilian.\nNevertheless, some challenges as to the identification of a person acting in the “cyberspace” as a combatant will remain. For example, a member of regular armed forces and thus a combatant will not be recognizable as such when using his private computer at home, the latter sending during an Internet session information identifying the user as a civilian. This resembles the “real world” situation, when a soldier is not wearing the uniform when being at home and thus cannot visually be identified as a combatant as well. Thus, the remaining challenges are not new and will mostly resemble similar “real world” cases.\n## ii. Civilian Objects According to Article 48 AP I, civilian objects must be distinguished from military objectives. Civilian objects must not be the objects of attack or reprisals (Articles 48, 52(1)-(2) and 57 AP I, see also Art. 23(g) HR and further specific regulations in Articles 53–56 AP I and Articles 14–16 AP II). Generally, this principle of distinction, as well as the above-mentioned prohibitions, can also be observed within the “virtual world”.\n¹¹⁴ See the profound examination by S. Watts, ‘Combatant Status and Computer Network Attack’, Vol. 50 No. 2 Virginia J.I.L. 2010, pp. 391–447.\n¹¹⁵ The WhoIs? databases of the RIRs (see supra note 58) provide information on which IP address is assigned to which end customer (in the case of dynamic IP-addresses: to which Internet Service Provider). Thus, the database DENIC (available at http://www.denic.de) provides respective information on “.de” domains, and the database RIPE (available at http://www.ripe.net) on the other domains in Europe, InterNIC (available at http://www.internic.net/whois.html) on the domains “com”, “edu”, “int”, “net” or “org”. The database Network Information Center (available at http://www.nic.com) leads to official and regional WhoIs? databases as well as to respective private databases available online.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) Viruses, bugs and – in the future – micro-mechanical organisms can be programmed in such a way that they only affect military computer networks, namely those with corresponding IP addresses or IP address ranges. The identification of a computer or computer system as military or civilian can be made by a search request of a specific IP address in one of the Whols? databases (see supra III.2.B.i).\nMalicious CNO against a purely military computer network, such as the Intranet or other communication systems of armed forces supported by the Intranet, would be perfectly legal in regard to LOAC. CNO launched against civilian computer networks – in case they are not to be considered as military objectives pursuant to Article 52(2) AP I – would only be allowed when they are not to be considered as an “attack” in the sense of Article 49(1) AP I, i.e. would not cause any physical damage (see supra III.1.B). A mere suppression or denial of access of the civilian population to a computer network or to specific data as well as the mere manipulation or the deletion of particular data would not fall under the prohibition of attack, as long as physical damage in- or outside the directly affected networks is not caused. For example, the deletion of a particular electronically operated bank account of a civilian would not be forbidden as a matter of LOAC.\nDistinction between civilian objects and military objectives becomes difficult when a computer network is used by both combatants and non-combatants (so-called dual use objects). This applies especially to the global Internet where, apart from the civilian population, there is a high probability that it will also be used by Parties to an armed conflict for the purposes of communication and information gathering. According to some scholars, the Internet is to be deemed as a military objective as soon as it is also used for military purposes.[116] Considering that nowadays the Internet is as an equally important means of communication as telephone and telegraph connections were in the past, the aforementioned opinion is supported by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had already in 1956 classified the latter as military objectives.[117] [116] This assertion is made in general terms, referring to communication networks used for both military and civilian purposes by Jensen, supra note 105, pp. 1160 et seq.; J.P. Terry, ‘The Lawfulness of Attacking Computer Networks in Armed Conflict and in Self-Defense in Period Short of Armed Conflict: What are the Targeting Constrains?’, Vol. 169 Mil. L. Rev. 2001, p. 85; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 35. Similarly: Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, no. 2.4.2., p. 324.\n[117] Annex Military Targets to the Draft Rules for the Limitation of Dangers Incurred However, some scholars refuse to classify civilian means of communication merely co-used for military purposes as a military objective.¹¹⁸ Indeed, in order to avoid any “automatism”, a thorough examination of the definition of a military objective provided by Article 52(2) AP I will be necessary. The definition clearly refers to objects only. Thus, at first sight, it seems doubtful whether the “virtual world” of the Internet can be deemed to be an object. However, the computer system Internet is not a purely intellectual construction. It comprises a multitude of objects, including technical equipment as servers, cables, cross points and access points; thus, the provision is in general applicable to the Internet. According to this definition, the computer system Internet or any other (dual use) computer network is to be considered as a military objective, if - the computer network makes an effective contribution¹¹⁹ to military action by its use, and - the total or partial destruction or neutralization of the computer network offered a definite (i.e. concrete and perceptible)¹²⁰ military advantage (in regard to the overall military operation).¹²¹ Whether the Internet meets these conditions depends on the degree to which the other Party to the armed conflict uses the Internet, and whether this Party can easily revert to alternative communication means. Therefore, the characterisation of the Internet, or other dual use computer networks, as a military objective depends on the circumstances of the specific situation, especially on the degree of the dependence of the adversary Party on those networks, *ergo* on the level of the technologisation of the adversary armed forces.\nEven if the Internet was to be considered to be a military objective in the context of a particular armed conflict, it must be considered that it would be allowed to be attacked only as far as its physical elements by the Civilian Population in Time of War, see Fleck, supra note 66, § 443. von Heinegg, supra note 77, pp. 150 seq.\n¹¹⁸ The examination, whether the “contribution” shall have a particular significance for or shall merely support a certain military operation, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further details see Fleck, supra note 66, § 442; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.3., p. 324.\n¹²⁰ See R. Wedgwood, ‘Proportionality, Cyberwar and the Law of War’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 225; and von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 150.\n¹²¹ Wedgwood, supra note 120, p. 225; Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 149; Fleck, supra note 66, § 444; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.4. See also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) of the ICC Statute.\n\n(e.g. server, cross points and WLAN¹²² access points) are located on the territory of one of the Parties to the particular armed conflict. But, even if such an attack was conducted successfully, a connection to the Internet could still be made from the same geographical area, for example via a mobile phone or other device enabled with respective software permitting Internet connectivity. Thus, an attack against the Internet intending the *quasi* disabling of a network within the area of conflict is unlikely to succeed.¹²³ ### iii. Objects under Special Protection Additionally, LOAC provides special protection against attacks and reprisals for specific civilian objects. Corresponding prohibitions can be found in Article 27 HR, Articles 19-21 GC I., Articles 22 and 24 GC II., Articles 18 *et seq.* GC IV, Article 4 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954 and in its Protocol I of 1954 and Protocol II of 1999, Articles 12, 21, 24 *et seq.*, 54(2) and (4) and 56 AP I as well as in Articles 11 and 14–16 AP II. Pursuant to these provisions, special protection is provided for dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (*inter alia* drinking water installations and water irrigation works), medical units and transportation, historic monuments, works of art or places of worship etc. As far as incorporating computer-based elements, the above-mentioned objects could be disrupted or even destroyed by the means of a cyber attack. Therefore, the computer-based cooling system of a nuclear power plant, for example, must not be disabled by remote control, a drinking water installation must not be destroyed by a computer controlled opening and closing of its valves, a medical aircraft must not be caused to crash by manipulation of data of an air traffic control system, or a museum protected by *ius in bello* must not be flooded by the remote activation of a water sprinkler system.\n¹²² In general terms, a *Wireless Local Area Network* (WLAN) describes a local wireless and direct connection between two or more mobile end devices (*clients*), which are equipped with a wireless access device. Usually, *clients* access the Internet via a central bridge (so-called *access point*). The bridge has a *router*, which – based on a *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol* (DHPC server) – assigns a dynamic IP address to each *host* (see also *supra* note 58) seeking connectivity to the Internet.\n¹²³ In order to disable the Internet, all its thirteen *root servers* (i.e. the main *domain name servers* or the main server layer of the internet) would have to be disconnected or destroyed. For security reasons, those servers are located in different, secret sites which are geographically distant. It is asserted that disabling up to ten of the *root servers* would probably merely delay the data transfer via the Internet.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) Generally speaking, the aforementioned provisions, which provide special protection for specific civilian objects, can cease in the event that the objects are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy or for regular, significant and direct support for military operations of the enemy. In general terms, an active counter-CNO (back-hacking) could be legally launched once a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit to stop the forbidden activities, and after such warning has remained unheeded. For example, in the case of the computer network of a medical unit, if it had been identified as the location of origin of malicious CNO, as an exception, an active counter-CNO could be launched if a warning about the forthcoming back-hacking had been given in advance, for instance in the form of a pop-up window which would appear on the computer screen of the cyber attacker.\nIt should also be considered that as far as an attack against an object is forbidden, the enemy must not be led to attack such objects. Therefore, CNO which would correspondingly manipulate a targeting database of the adversary Party to the armed conflict in order to assign the data of the geographical coordinates of a civilian object under special protection to the data of a military objective of the adversary Party would be forbidden. As an example, when manipulating the adversary's targeting database, a munitions factory must not be assigned the geographical coordinates of a hospital.\n## 3. The Law of Neutrality and the Cyberspace First of all, neutrality in the sense of *ius in bellum* has to be distinguished from permanent neutrality (e.g. the cases of Austria, the Holy See, and Switzerland), i.e. the legal obligation undertaken in peacetime to remain neutral in cases of armed conflict or war between other States, and from the mere neutrality policy (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Ireland), which, nonetheless, can have some legally binding effects due to the situation of confidence created in which other States may rely on the (political) declarations to remain neutral (principle of estoppel).¹²⁴ ## A. The Applicability of the Law of Neutrality Neutrality is a particular status of a State not Party to an armed conflict of significant scope or – according to a traditional view – to a “war ¹²⁴ Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1105.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) in the legal sense” between other States.¹²⁵ Although it is not crucial for the purposes of the present survey to decide which view is to be followed, it may be mentioned that the International Court of Justice stated in its Advisory Opinion on the *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* of 8 July 1996 that “[...] the principle of neutrality [...] is applicable [...], to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used”.¹²⁶ However, it must always be taken into consideration that in particular cases the rules governing neutrality may be modified by collective self-defence provisions such as Article 51 UN Charter and Article 5 North Atlantic Treaty (depriving a State of the possibility to legally join an armed conflict or a war on the side of the aggressor) and by (binding) decisions taken by the UN Security Council (see Articles 2(5) and 25 and Chapter VII UN Charter; the obligation to assist any action taken by the UN in accordance with the Charter would forestall a State to appeal to its neutrality).¹²⁷ In the following it will be shown that the rules on neutrality – which are over 100 years old – apply to military operations conducted in cyberspace (during an armed conflict of significant scope or a “war in the legal sense”). When examining the law of neutrality, no difference will be made between the specific rules applying to land, air or sea warfare, as the distinction between these areas is not relevant to CNO.\n## B. Prohibition of CNO Causing Physical Damage First and foremost, the rules of neutrality protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the neutral State, see Article 1 Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907 (HC V) and Art. 1 Hague Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 1907 (HC XIII).\nThus, the principle of neutrality prohibits causing physical damage on the sovereign territory of a neutral State.¹²⁸ Consequently, a malicious ¹²⁵ The discussion of the question, whether rules on neutrality apply in situations of war (in legal sense) only or also in situations of an armed conflict of significant scope, would exceed the scope of the present survey. Interested readers may be referred to the assessment in Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1106.\n¹²⁶ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90 (emphasis by the author).\n¹²⁷ See further details at Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1103; and G. Walker, ‘Information Warfare and Neutrality’, Vol. 33 *Vanderbilt J. Transnational L.* 2000, pp. 1079 et seq.\n¹²⁸ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90. Regarding the necessary criteria of a “physical encroachment” CNO would only breach the principle of the territorial inviolability of a neutral State if it – indirectly – caused physical damage (deaths, injuries or destruction of property) on the territory of a neutral State or medium to long-term disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a neutral State (see supra III.1.A.vi). In this regard, the physical damage could refer to physical components (technical equipment) of the Internet and/or other computer systems as well as to objects/living beings outside the affected computer systems.\nIn regard to critical infrastructure systems, it must always be considered that they can be shared by several States (e.g. an electricity distribution system is shared between Laos and Thailand, between Venezuela and Brazil, between Canada and the United States and between Indonesia and Singapore; one telecommunication system is shared by several States in East and South-East Asia).[129] Thus, before targeting a critical infrastructure system of the adversary it must always be examined (in addition to other LOAC provisions relevant to targeting) whether the estimated damage could also automatically affect another State neutral to the particular armed conflict or war.\n# C. The Use of Telecommunication Means Belonging to a Neutral State According to Article 8 HC V, a neutral State can allow the belligerents to use\"telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals\". The neutral State also has the right to restrict or prohibit the use of such communication means, if applied (by the State, companies or individuals) impartially to all belligerents (see Article 9 HC V and 9(1) HC XIII).\nIn regard to the Internet, such a restriction or prohibition could be enforced by a neutral State by applying certain software to all Internet cross points located on its territory. The software would scan the Internet traffic for data packages sent by the belligerents and delete them. Of course, a neutral State could also disable all technical components supporting the worldwide network Internet and located on its territory. This way, the belligerents would not use the Internet components located on the territory of the neutral State, although the Internet system as such would continue to function and could be further used by the Parties to the armed conflict or war.\nsee Greenberg, Goodman &amp; Soo Hoo, supra note 75, p. 10.\n\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) In the case one Party of the armed conflict or war used the computer network located on the territory of a neutral State to send malicious CNO to the computer systems of the other belligerent – either by launching malicious CNO from neutral State’s territory or by using Internet cross points or other technical equipment located on its territory –, the neutral State would have the right to “protect” its neutral status by taking appropriate actions (e.g. back-hacking). If it failed to do so, the neutral State would have – pursuant to the principle of non-discrimination of belligerents – the obligation to allow the affected belligerent to take action against the malicious CNO.^[130]^ ## D. Data Streams Passing the Territory of a Neutral State However, it is perfectly possible, even likely, that in the course of the conduct of CNO the data stream carrying malicious components (e.g. viruses or worms) to the adversary’s computer systems passes Internet crossing points and servers located on the territory of a neutral State. However, this would not result in violation of neutrality law.\nFirst of all, a Party to a conflict cannot influence whether a data stream crosses the technical components of the Internet situated on the territory of a neutral State or not. Every data stream sent via the Internet is divided in data packages, each one of which takes – out of millions possible routs – a certain route from cross point to cross point around the globe. The respective choices are done automatically by the Internet system (depending on the traffic load on the routes) and cannot be foreseen or influenced.^[131]^ Furthermore, according to Article 3(a) HC V and Article 5 HC XIII, a Party to an armed conflict or war is only forbidden to “[e]rect on the territory [including territorial waters] of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea”, and pursuant to Article 3(b) HC V to “[u]se any installation of this kind established by them [i.e. belligerents] before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages”. This means that belligerents are allowed to use all non-purely military means of communication erected or established on the territory of a neutral State – by whomever – before the armed conflict or war. This would apply to all technical installations on the territory of ^[130]^ Jensen, *supra* note 105, pp. 238 et seq.\n^[131]^ Walker, *supra* note 127, pp. 1079 et seq.\n\nthe neutral State being part of the worldwide, already existing computer network Internet, as it is – also historically – a communication means used by civilians also. It is asserted within academic writings that the establishment of a connection to the Internet as such should be deemed as similar to the forbidden “erecting” of a “communication apparatus”.¹³² However, it is more convincing to compare the establishment of a connection to the Internet to connecting to the worldwide telephone system by dialling a phone number – which would surely not be considered as forbidden “erecting” a “communication apparatus” by a belligerent.\nFinally, it must be endorsed that, because the law of neutrality does provide special provisions referring to communication systems on land or in territorial waters (Art. 3 HC V and Art. 5 HC XIII), there is no need or space for an (analogous) application of rules relating to the innocent passage through territorial waters, as asserted in some scholar writings.¹³³ ## IV. Concluding Remarks Given the developments in technology and reliance on computer systems, in the future, CNO are likely to be of considerable significance for the planning and conduct of military operations. One of the reasons is that both the equipment and the conduct of CNO are extremely inexpensive when compared to conventional military operations. In addition, CNO can be conducted by only a few experts and from any location distant from the (traditional) area of combat, which safeguards the physical protection of the members of armed forces involved. Furthermore, as mentioned above, within the context of so-called asymmetric warfare, CNO can be a powerful weapon in the hands of non-state actors against the technologically highly developed armed forces of post-industrial States sensitive to malfunctions of their computer networks.\nOwing to the potential physical effects of CNO, the Parties to any future armed conflict in which CNO will be carried out, either in support of conventional military abilities or as the only method of war fighting conducted, will have to observe relevant LOAC provisions. The spirit and purpose of these protection granting rules, as well as the values they reflect, are timeless. They offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n¹³² *Id.* ¹³³ Such an assertion is made by Walker, *supra* note 127.\nREVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) Neither a lack of regulation nor a need for amendment of “aged” norms can be identified, when a teleological interpretation of the provisions is applied.\nThe future practice of the armed forces will show whether adjustments in the interpretation of relevant LOAC provisions will have to be made. The practice of the international community will decide, whether in the future it will be considered necessary to increase the level of the humanitarian protection during armed conflicts, and thus to include protection e.g. of data contained in computers or computer networks of non-combatants. Unquestionably, lawyers advising armed forces will have ever more to deal with corresponding questions of law and to understand the technical details of CNO as an emerging weapon, means or method of war.\n\n## Summary – Résumé – Samenvatting – Zusammenfassung – Riassunto – Resumen\n## Summary – Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nThe Internet has become the most essential means of communication and information. This results in a high dependency upon reliable operations of Internet based communication systems, especially those supporting critical infrastructure systems. Given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to security, the vulnerability of computer systems has become a significant matter of (national or collective) security to many States as well as to NATO. The potential conduct of “Computer Network Operations” (CNO), i.e. military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks, presents some legal challenges. This survey first examines the nature of CNO and discusses the difficulties of identification of the origin and of attribution of a malicious action carried out via or in the cyberspace to a certain actor. After the presentation of some criteria for the qualification of CNO as “use of armed force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning), the survey argues that the Laws of Armed Conflict, including the over hundred years old principles and provisions of neutrality, do apply to CNO. At the same time, it demonstrates that the provisions offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n## Résumé – Les Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques et le Droit des Confits Armés\nL’internet est devenu un moyen de communication et d’information indispensable. Il en résulte une grande dépendance envers la fiabilité du fonctionnement des systèmes de communication basé sur l’internet, particulièrement ceux au soutien d’infrastructures critiques. Étant donné les insuffisances de l’internet en matière de sécurité, la vulnérabilité des systèmes d’ordinateurs est devenue un sujet important pour la sécurité (nationale et collective) de plusieurs États ainsi que pour l’OTAN. La conduite éventuelle d’Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques (OCRI), à savoir des actions militaires offensives ou défensives prises grâce aux moyens mêmes de l’internet ou de réseaux d’ordinateurs, présente quelques défis juridiques. Cet article examine d’abord la nature des OCRI et discute des difficultés associées à l’identification de l’origine et de l’attribution à un acteur précis d’une action malicieuse\n\nexécutée à travers ou au sein du cyber espace. Après avoir présenté quelques critères pour qualifier les OCRI comme étant une utilisation de la force armée (au sens *ius in bello*) l'auteur soutient ensuite que le droit des conflits armés ainsi que les principes et dispositions plus que centenaire en matière de neutralité s'appliquent aux OCRI. Par la même occasion, l'article démontre que ces dispositions offrent un niveau de protection humanitaire qui est comparable à celui en vigueur pour l'utilisation des armes classiques.\n## Samenvatting – Computer netwerk operaties en het humanitair oorlogsrecht Het Internet is uitgegroeid tot het belangrijkste communicatie- en informatiemiddel. Dit heeft geleid tot een grote afhankelijkheid van op Internet gebaseerde communicatiesystemen, vooral van die systemen die kritische infrastructuur ondersteunen. Door de beperkingen van het Internet op het gebied van beveiliging, is de kwetsbaarheid van computersystemen een zaak van (nationale of collectieve) veiligheid geworden voor veel staten en voor de NAVO. Computer netwerk operaties (CNO), dat wil zeggen defensieve of offensieve militaire handelingen door middel van Internet of andere computernetwerken, roept juridische vragen op. Dit artikel onderzoekt eerst wat CNO is en bespreekt de moeilijkheden rond het identificeren van de bron van en toerekening aan een bepaalde actor van een vijandige handeling die in of via cyberspace wordt uitgevoerd. Nadat een aantal criteria voor de kwalificatie van CNO als geweldgebruik (in de zin van het *ius in bello*) zijn geponeerd, beargumenteert het artikel dat het humanitair oorlogsrecht, waaronder de principes en regels betreffende neutraliteit die meer dan honderd jaar oud zijn, zich lenen voor toepassing op CNO. Aangetoond wordt dat de bepalingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht binnen dit domein een niveau van bescherming bieden dat vergelijkbaar is met het niveau dat van toepassing is op het gebruik van conventionele wapens.\n## Zusammenfassung – Computernetwerkoperationen und das humanitäre Völkerrecht Das Internet wurde zu einem essentiellen Kommunikations- und Informationsmittel unserer Zeit.

Dies gilt insbesondere für diejenigen Systeme, die kritische Infrastruktursysteme eines Staates MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) unterstützen. Da das Internet in Bezug auf die Sicherheit Mängel aufweist, wurde die Integrität von Computersystemen für manche Staaten so wie auch für die NATO zu einer Frage der (nationalen bzw. kollektiven) Sicherheit. Das potenzielle Durchführen von Computernetzwerkoperationen (CNO), d.h. defensiven oder offensiven Handlungen der Streitkräfte unter Inanspruchnahme des Internet oder anderer Computernetzwerke, bietet einige Herausforderungen rechtlicher Art. In dem vorliegenden Artikel wird zunächst die Natur von CNO dargelegt. Ferner werden die Schwierigkeiten in Bezug auf die Identifizierung des Ursprungs und die Zurechnung einer im virtuellen Raum vorgenommenen schädigenden Handlung zu einem bestimmten Akteur erörtert. Nachdem einige Kriterien für die Einordnung von CNO als „Anwendung bewaffneter Gewalt “(im Sinne des *ius in bello*) vorgestellt werden, wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht, einschließlich der über hundert Jahre alten Prinzipien und Regelungen des Neutralitätsrechts, auf CNO anwendbar ist. Zugleich wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht hierbei einen humanitären Schutzstandard bietet, der demjenigen gleicht, der bei der Anwendung konventioneller Waffen gilt.\n## Riassunto – Computer Network Operations e il diritto dei conflitti armati La rete internet è divenuta il più importante mezzo di comunicazione ed informazione dell’era contemporanea. Ciò determina una sostanziale dipendenza dal corretto funzionamento dei sistemi di comunicazione basati su tale rete, specialmente per ciò che concerne quelli di sostegno ad infrastrutture critiche. Vista la scarsa sicurezza della comunicazione via internet, la vulnerabilità dei sistemi informatici è diventata una questione di rilievo per la sicurezza (nazionale o collettiva) di molti stati e per la NATO. La potenziale condotta di ‘Operazioni militari su reti informatiche’ (*Computer Network Operations – CNO*), ovvero operazioni militari difensive o offensive scatenate tramite internet o per altra via informatica, presenta tuttavia talune incertezze dal punto di vista giuridico. Dapprima questo articolo esamina la vera natura delle CNO, mettendo in luce le difficoltà di identificazione e attribuzione di un’azione delittuosa portata avanti nello spazio cibernetico (o mediante quest’ultimo), a danno di un determinato soggetto. Successivamente, dopo aver presentato alcuni criteri guida per una corretta qualificazione delle CNO come un vero e proprio “uso della forza armata” (secondo lo *ius in bello*), l’articolo dimostra che il diritto dei conflitti armati, assieme agli ultra-centenari principi e norme sulla neutralità, trova applicazione REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010) in caso di CNO. Allo stesso modo, lo scritto evidenzia come tali norme offrano un livello di protezione umanitaria comparabile con quello applicabile nel caso di uso di armi convenzionali.\n## Resumen – Operaciones a través de la red informática y Derecho de los Conflictos Armados.\nInternet ha acabado por convertirse en un importante medio de comunicación e información de la era contemporánea. Esto lleva consigo un alto grado de dependencia con respecto a los sistemas de comunicación centrados en la red, especialmente por lo que se refiere a los sistemas que sirven de apoyo a infraestructuras vitales. Vista la escasa seguridad de las comunicaciones a través de internet, la vulnerabilidad de los sistemas de información se ha convertido en una cuestión prioritaria para la seguridad (nacional y colectiva) de muchos Estados así como para la OTAN. Las conductas potenciales que pueden ser objeto de las operaciones a través de la red informática (Computer Network Operations – CNO), como por ejemplo acciones militares tanto ofensivas como defensivas llevadas a cabo a través de internet o de otras redes de información, presentan aspectos interesantes desde el punto de vista jurídico. El presente artículo examina en primer lugar la naturaleza de las CNO y analiza las dificultades que existen para identificar el sistema en el que tiene su origen un ataque y la posterior atribución de una conducta delictiva llevada a cabo en el espacio cibernético (o a través de este último) a un sujeto determinado. Tras la exposición de algunos criterios que permiten calificar las CNO como “uso de fuerza armada” (en el sentido del *ius in bello*), el artículo demuestra que el Derecho de los Conflictos Armados resulta de aplicación a las CNO, incluidos los principios y preceptos ultra-centenarios relativos a la neutralidad. Al mismo tiempo, pone de manifiesto cómo ese Derecho ofrece un nivel de protección humanitaria comparable con el que es de aplicación en el campo del uso de armas convencionales."

Introduction In this day and age, the Internet¹ is one of the most important means of communication and information. During the last 30 years it has gradually become an essential aspect of the economy in a globalized world and plays an indispensable role in, amongst other things, the administrative and judicial systems of technologically developed countries. All in all, critical infrastructure systems in States with high levels of technology dependency are acutely reliant upon reliable and effective operations of Internet based communication systems. Thus, given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to the security, protection and defence of the integrity of computer networks, the vulnerability of these communication systems has become a significant matter of national security to many such States. Accordingly, the current National Security Strategies of the USA², of the United Kingdom³, ¹ The Internet is globally administered by a Californian (US) non-profit, public-benefit corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which, in the framework of a Public Private Partnership, is associated with and reports to the US Department of Commerce (although, according to the information on ICANN’s website, the organisation heavily emphasises its international nature and independence). ICANN bears global responsibility for ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet as well as for coordinating the Internet system of unique identifiers, i.e. for the assignment of IP-address ranges (since 2005 not directly to users but to regional organisations – see infra note 58). It is further responsible for the generic codes and country codes of the Internet top level domain as well as for the management and maintenance of the (secret) Internet root server system (see infra note 122). ICANN is the successor organization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which was executing the above-mentioned tasks directly on behalf of the US Department of Commerce (information available at http://www.icann/org/en/factsheets/factsheet.html; unless indicated otherwise, all URLs cited in the present survey were last visited on 31 November 2010). Originally, it was planned to transform ICANN into an independent organization in October 2006. During the 2nd World Summit on the Information Society, organized by the UN in Tunis in November 2005, it was proposed to submit ICANN (and thus the Internet itself) to management by the UN. The USA rejected this proposal and declared its intent to keep the control over ICANN for the time being (information available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/).\n² The President of the United States of America, National Security Strategy (May 2010), p. 27 et seq., available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf.\n³ Her Majesty’s Government, A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The National Security Strategy (October 2010), pp. 11 and 27, available at http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191639.pdf?CID=PDF&amp;PLA=furl&amp;CRE=nationalsecuritystrategy.\nand Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defence White Paper,⁴ all seek to address the issue of cyber-attacks.

With regard to the creation of a global culture of cyber security, see the resolutions Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information structures, MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) the Internet for terrorist purposes (cyber terrorism) is currently on the agendas of several international initiatives and programmes.7 Military forces use the Internet for communication purposes and – to a certain extent – as an inherent component of particular weapon systems. Additionally, the Internet offers the possibility for offensive and/or defensive military actions by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. The military term “Computer Network Operations” (CNO) refers, generally speaking, to computer hacking and back-hacking in the context of a military operation.\nWorldwide, military forces are preparing for the fight in cyberspace. It has been alleged that Israeli armed forces have engaged in CNO activities since the early 1990s.8 The USA established a US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in Fort Meade, Maryland on 23 June 2009 (operational as of October 2010) which unified the already existing cyber capabilities of the US National Security Agency and several US military services (Army Forces Cyber Command, 24th US Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command).9 According to media reports, Belgium10, Germany11, South Korea12 (allegedly in reaction to respective North Korean endeavours), and the UN Documents A/55/63 of 4 December 2000, A/56/121 of 19 December 2001, A/57/239 of 20 December 2002, and A/58/199 of 23 December 2003.\nUnited Kingdom (Government Communications Headquarters)¹³ have established similar commands in 2009, while China¹⁴ did so in 2010.¹⁵ Undeniably, CNO have become an important weapon, means or method of warfare extending the – traditionally clearly defined – battlefield to the global cyberspace. Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n¹³ See C.

Branigen, ‘Chinese Army to Target Cyber War Threat’, Guardian online of 22 July 2010, available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/22/chinese-army-cyber-war-department.\n¹⁵ According to some reports, Chinese armed forces built up CNO capabilities already some years ago, see e.g. Northrop Grumman Corporation - Information Systems Sector, Capability of the People’s Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation (Report of 9 October 2009 Prepared for The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), available at http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) ## II. The Nature and Significance of CNO In the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).\n\n---\n\n## ## v. Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems There is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems⁹³ by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]”⁹⁴ This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.\n\nHowever, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment.⁹⁵ This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems.⁹⁶ It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing ⁹³ See supra section II.1.C.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n⁹⁵ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n⁹⁶ Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599. See also Sharp, supra note 75, pp. 129 et seq. Contra: Dinstein, supra note 75, p. 105; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 8, who demand the occurrence of physical damage outside the targeted computer networks in order to qualify CNO as use of force.\nMILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010) similar effects on critical infrastructure systems would be considered as “use of armed force”.\nvi. Intermediate Result All in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities” As far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).",

Especially because cyberspace seems to be “boundless”, many scholars claim that the existing rules of public international law, traditionally based on the notion of State sovereignty and thus State borders, do not meet the legal challenges which CNO present.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue that the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) apply to military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks. At the same time, it will demonstrate that the provisions of LOAC offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons. Due to the focus of this paper, the question whether and under which circumstances CNO can be considered as an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) or Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will be not examined. Therefore, whenever the term “cyber attack” is used, it does not aim to indicate that an “armed attack” in the legal sense has necessarily occurred.\n\nIn the following, the nature and the significance of CNO will be described (II). Thereafter, the legal analysis of CNO as pertaining to LOAC will be examined (III). These sections will be followed by some concluding remarks (IV).\n\n¹³ See C.

    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\n## II. The Nature and Significance of CNO\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the various forms and effects of CNO will be examined (1). Next, the challenge of the attribution of a cyber attack will be discussed (2). Finally, the significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations in the context of contemporary armed conflicts will be addressed (3).\n\n## 1. Forms and Effects of CNO\n\nThe concept of CNO covers the following activities: defence against a cyber attack launched against one’s own computer networks (Computer Network Defence – CND), information and intelligence gathering from adversary computer networks (Computer Network Exploitation – CNE) and the conduct of a cyber attack against adversary’s computer networks (Computer Network Attack – CNA).\n\nThe above-mentioned components of CNO are strongly interrelated. An adversary’s CNA can help one’s own CND when analysed appropriately. A CNE cannot be conducted without CNA, as the information to be gathered by CNE will mostly be protected by firewalls, passwords and other barriers that are erected to prevent an adversarial CNA. Finally, CNA cannot be conducted without CNE, as without information gathering on the targeted network’s architecture and systems the CNA would effectively be conducted blindly.\n\nWhile the practical value of the taxonomy of CND/CNE/CNA therefore is questionable, it will be presented in more detail below as most academic writings and media reports refer to this classification.\n\n## A. CND\n\nCND is the protection of one’s own computer systems against cyber attacks or illegal access. It includes protection of access to the networks, e.g. by passwords, the constant analysis of all hacking efforts and the continuous improvement of security standards. These improvements can comprise particular security settings in one’s own operating systems (e.g. closing of identified security gaps), establishment of respective network protection structures (e.g. individual assignment of so-called ports, i.e. “entrance/exit doors” for data streams) and firewalls, the installation of special software detecting intrusions and, if available, a honey net (i.e. a computer network established outside and around",
    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\none’s own network serving as a *quasi* buffer zone).¹⁶ The terms “active defence in cyberspace” or “active CND”, every now and then used in media reports or even military policies,¹⁷ merely refers to launching a cyber counter-attack against the cyber attacker’s computer networks, thus using means of CNA.\n\n## B. CNE\n\nAccording to NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions, CNE is an “action taken to make use of a computer or computer network, as well as the information hosted therein, in order to gain advantage”.¹⁸ This kind of “electronic intelligence gathering” aims at information about the architecture of the targeted network (*network-mapping*), the operating system data (*footprinting*) and, finally, all data saved in adversary systems, which contain information in the common sense. Consequently, CNE should be considered as a form of modern electronic espionage.\n\nAccording to open source reports, the vast majority of CNO activities conducted during peacetime consist of CNE. For example, already in 2007, the British intelligence service MI5 warned all financial service providers and companies in Great Britain against concerted cyber espionage endeavours by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.¹⁹ In summer 2007, the computer systems of Germany’s Federal Chancellery as well as those of some federal ministries were infected with spyware (i.e. espionage software) reported to have originated from China.²⁰ According to the Annual Report 2009 of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, computer systems of Germany’s federal and state governments and of private businesses were targeted by hundreds of (successful and/or unsuccessful) CNE.

However, it can be assumed that CNE is very likely to be used in support of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance.\n\n## C. CNA\n\nCNA can cause multiple effects. NATO’s Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines CNA as an “action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer network, or the computer and/or computer network itself”.²⁴ These are all forms of manipulation, suppression or deletion of data in adversary networks, or the delay, suppression or interruption of data transfer processes. The methods, means and techniques of CNA are manifold (e.g. breaking of passwords, injecting malware²⁵). The effects can involve either the system or the user level (e.g. delay or interruption of data transfer) and can indirectly cause physical damage outside the targeted computer networks.\n\nRelatively harmless, data modification in the course of a CNA can modify and deface a website (defacement). This is often conducted by hackers who wish to express their political view (hacktivism). Another widely spread form of CNA is the Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack\n\n21 Bundesministerium des Innern, Verfassungsschutzbericht 2009 (2010), p. 308, available at http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/de/publikationen/verfassungsschutzbericht/vsbericht_2009/vsbericht_2009.pdf; summary (in English), pp. 9 et seq., available at http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/SHOW/vsbericht_2009_engl.pdf.\n\n22 W.J.

The particular DDoS-techniques are as diverse as the – partly very effective – countermeasures²⁷ developed since 2000.\n\nHowever, the deletion or modification of data in a successfully intruded computer network can be more hazardous. Hackers can generate wrong information, for instance in the military environment the content of electronically transmitted orders, plans and maps or the localization data of military targets contained in a targeting-database.\n\nMoreover, it is possible that a CNA could – indirectly – cause death, physical injury or physical destruction of property. As far as chemical plants, nuclear power stations, oil refinery installations, gas store installations or electrical power distribution installations have or rely on computer-based control systems, these systems could be penetrated and manipulated. Thus, a CNA could cause the explosion of a nuclear power plant if the cooling systems were disabled via remote control. The same applies to computer-based control systems of transportation systems. By manipulation of the rail points, train derailments or collisions could be caused; penetration and minimal amendments to the programming of an air traffic control system could result in aircraft incidents. Therefore, the classification of CNO as a non-lethal weapon, as asserted by some scholars,²⁸ has to be challenged in this regard. Also, the general assertion made that CNO, in its current form would generally not violate LOAC, is questionable.²⁹\n\n26 A Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS attack) is a Denial of Service attack (DoS attack) simultaneously conducted from several computers, which are interconnected by a previously (and mostly in secret) established computer network (net boot). During a DoS attack, the targeted server is overloaded by a mass of connectivity requests, which first results in a significant delay of data processing. This subsequently leads to a denial of data processing service and finally results in the disabling of the affected server. This effect can be caused by sending either masses of data packages (e.g. emails to an email server) or masses of connectivity requests (e.g. masses of connectivity requests to a website).\n\n27 See C.

The list of critical infrastructure systems will slightly differ from State to State. By way of example, the following areas identified by the German Federal Office of Security of Information Technology (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) can be considered as critical infrastructure systems:³⁰ transportation and traffic (postal services, local traffic, roads, rail system, aviation, sea and inland navigation); energy (nuclear plants, distribution and transfer systems of electricity, oil, gas); hazardous substances (chemical and biological agents, nuclear reactors); information and telecommunication technology; finance, currency and insurance (banks, insurance companies, financial service providers, stock markets); public utilities (health, emergency and rescue sector, disaster control, food and water supply, waste management); government, administration, justice, police, customs and armed forces.\n\nMany of these critical infrastructure systems are based on computer-based control systems, such as the generation and distribution of electricity or telecommunications. Some function entirely on the basis of an Internet connection, including the banking and stock exchange systems. Other areas are increasingly reliant on the Internet, for example the so-called e-justice and e-government. In any technologically highly developed, post-industrial State most of the critical infrastructure systems can be deemed to depend on the operability and efficiency of electronic data transfer. The devastating effects and the subsequent disruption of the ordre public caused by a CNA are limited only by the imagination of the reader. Therefore, cyber security plays a paramount role for the national security of many States and was noted as one of the major perils for the Alliance's security in NATO's Strategic Concept of 2010 (see supra I).\n\nThere is open source information available in the media on CNA being conducted during peacetime.\n\nThe only publicly known case, in which the attribution of a CNA to a particular State can be asserted, was the penetration and temporary disabling of Syrian air defence networks, especially the radar systems, by Israel on 6 September 2007, immediately followed by an airstrike by Israel's Air Force destroying Syria's Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Deir-Az-Zur.³¹\n\n³⁰ See the list of critical infrastructure systems, available at https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/Publikationen/Faltblaetter/F17KritischeInfrastruktur.html.\n\n³¹ Ben-David, supra note 8.",
    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nA more prominent case of a successful CNA against a State are the DDoS-attacks launched against several critical infrastructure systems in Estonia during the 27 April – 18 May 2007 timeframe. The “attacks”³² targeted websites and communication channels of the government and commercial services.³³ For example, the web-services of the major banks Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank were (at one-time) interrupted for 1,5 hours;³⁴ the website of a governing coalition party was defaced;³⁵ emergency phone numbers were disengaged for a short time;³⁶ and three major Estonian Internet Service Providers and some online news providers were disconnected (although it is unclear for how long).³⁷ The estimated physical (because of the disengagement of emergency phone numbers) and economic damage caused by the DDoS-attacks remains unclear. The attacks most probably originated from the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the relatively simple DDoS-methods and the political context of the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, it is asserted that the “attackers” were politically motivated private persons (hacktivism).³⁸\n\nAnother example of successful CNA during peacetime are the defacement and DDoS-attacks launched against Lithuania between 28 June and 1 July 2008. The CNA may have been connected either to the amendment of Lithuania’s laws to prohibit the display of symbols of the Soviet Union or the singing of its anthem in public³⁹ or to the unilateral veto⁴⁰ against discussions on an EU energy partnership deal with Russian Federation. Over 300 Lithuanian websites were defaced, including those of the Government.⁴¹ Given the pro-Russian contents\n\n32 The term “attack” does not indicate the legal assessment of the incidents as an “armed attack” in the meaning of Art. 51 UN Charter or Art. 5 North Atlantic Treaty.\n\n33 E.

It is highly unlikely that hackers will leave any tangible evidence, for example in the protocols of the intrusion detection systems of the attacked network, as such evidence in these protocols is easy to delete once the network is penetrated.\n\nMoreover, and further aggravating the issue, a cyber-attack can be conducted “anonymously”, for example by using one of the (often) free of charge anonymisation services offered on the Internet which would hide the unique characteristics of the hackers’ computer system. These unique characteristics are the so-called IP address⁵⁸ as well as other technical data⁵⁹ a computer sends while connected to the Internet.\n\n⁵⁸ An IP address (Internet Protocol number) is a twelve digit number, which identifies a computer or another network device during an Internet session. An IP data package is the basic element of data transmission via the Internet. It comprises: a header (containing information on the source, destination, status and fragmentation of the transmitted data) and a payload (containing the transmitted data). At the very beginning of the Internet, the IANA (see supra note 1) assigned static IP addresses, i.e. IP addresses permanently assigned to a particular user, to companies, organizations, universities and also to individuals. The assignment of IP addresses to individual users or of IP address ranges to Internet Access Providers is now regulated by ICANN (see supra note 1). Since February 2005, ICANN delegates this task to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR), i.e. regional organisations assigning IP addresses. These are AfriNIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia and Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Region) and RIPE NCC (Europe, Near East and Central Asia). The regional organisations assign the IP addresses to local organisations, mainly to Internet Service Providers (e.g. yahoo, gmail etc). Usually, an Internet user receives from the pool of IP addresses at the disposal of an Access Provider a specific (dynamic) IP address for the particular Internet session only. After the particular Internet session the dynamic IP address is assigned to another user and client of the respective Access Provider. At present, the so-called static IP-addresses are only being used for leased Internet-lines of major corporations and other entities.\n\n⁵⁹ These include: Media Access Control address (MAC address) or – for the operating system Apple – the Airport ID of a computer (order of numbers, which clearly identifies a computer hardware); Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, details on the assignment of a MAC address or Airport ID to an IP address); Service Set Identity (SSID, details on the network name); Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol (WEP, coded details about the network); as well as details on the operating system and its adjustments. These details are – if not blocked – automatically transferred during the Internet session to any computer requesting this information by a so-called PING (Packet InterNet Grouper). A PING is computer software sending an ICMP-Echo-Request data package to the destination address of the host which is to be scanned, i.e. to the IP address, to the Domain Name System name (DNS name) or to the Network Basic Input Output System name (NetBIOS name) of the targeted host. The targeted system automatically responds by an ICMP-Echo-Reply, if – according to the usual adjustments of the system – the system supports the ICMP package.",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nFurthermore, the Internet offers possibilities for deception in regard to the identity of the hackers' computer systems. It is perfectly possible to feign someone else's IP address and other technical data (so-called malicious misrepresentation or spoofing) and thus to operate in the Internet under someone else's \"cyber-identity\". The connection to the Internet can also be established via a mobile phone or other device with a feigned identity number. Additionally, the data stream can be conducted through the whole globe via a chain of computers of numerous unsuspecting individuals, if so-called zombie software (partly offered free of charge on the Internet) has been secretly installed on the respective computers by using Trojans. One of these computers could subsequently be misused as the sender of the data stream (so-called remote control). Thus, in the case of a cyber attack, even after a back tracing of the malicious data stream, the victim can seldom be sure as of the identification and geographical location of the computer system the attack originated from.\n\nAbove all, even if a malicious data stream of a cyber attack would indeed be successfully back-traced to the hackers' computer systems, it will – highly probable – remain unproven which individuals of which citizenship and on who's orders were operating the systems identified. Therefore, the attribution of a cyber attack to a certain individual, group, entity or State will most probably be based on unproven suspicions or indications only.\n\nConsequently, it will be very unlikely to recognize at first sight – and probably even after detailed technical analysis – whether the attack was conducted by a mischievous teenager, by a criminal (including a terrorist), by a group with extremist or terrorist background or by the adversary Party in an armed conflict.\n\nThese uncertainties will surely add to the complexity of both the legal analysis of a cyber attack and the victim's decision on choosing a subsequent course of action. Considering the difficulty in identifying and locating the hackers' computer systems and – most importantly – attributing the attack, in most cases it will remain in doubt whether national police forces and public prosecutors or, in the framework of international judicial cooperation, the police forces and public prosecutors of a foreign State, or the armed forces (in the case the attack occurs during an already existing armed conflict and is believed to have originated with a party to the armed conflict, or in the case the effects of the cyber-attack are comparable to a conventional armed\n\n63",

CNO in Modern Warfare\n\nThe significance of CNO for the conduct of military operations is manifold.\n\nWhilst most armed conflicts in this day and age are occurring in regions that are technologically less sophisticated (e.g. Afghanistan, Sudan or Chad), this does not result in the irrelevance of the Internet and of CNO. It must be taken into consideration that, in regard to communication abilities and collection of open source information, the parties to armed conflicts in less well developed regions are also essentially dependent on – aside from radio traffic – wireless Internet connectivity, as other communication and information systems (e.g. telecommunication media, print media, telephone lines) are often non-existent.\n\nIt is especially evident in the context of so-called asymmetric warfare and in the hands of non-state actors, for instance terrorists, that CNO can be a powerful weapon, primarily against post-industrial States and their potent armed forces. More than ever, post-industrial States have technologically highly developed armed forces at their disposal, which correspondingly react most sensitively to technical disorder. It is the dependence on the technology which makes them extremely vulnerable to a cyber attack.\n\nAs CNO can be conducted from any place in the world by as little as a few experts and, in addition, are extraordinarily inexpensive when compared with conventional military operations, they offer a particularly practical and extremely powerful \"weapon\". Therefore, all aspects of CNO (see supra II.1) show an increasing significance in the context of national as well as of international security.\n\nAs the Head of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Co-ordination Centre stated already in 2008: \"Cyber war can become a very effective global problem because it is low-risk, low-cost, highly effective and easily globally deployable. It is almost an ideal weapon that nobody can ignore\".60\n\n60 N.

Legal Analysis of CNO\n\nAlthough some scholars plead for a general prohibition of CNO, currently such a ban does not exist.⁶¹ However, many international and domestic legal restrictions do apply to CNO – a fact which makes a legal analysis a complex undertaking.\n\nApart from the fundamental principle of public international law, namely the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations, a number of specific areas of public international law may apply to CNO. As data packages pass through the territory of several States when sent via the Internet, the provisions of territorial sovereignty must be considered. Also, data manipulations might – under certain circumstances – be judged as intervention in domestic affairs of a State, which would be considered illegal under public international law. Further, because satellite technology is involved, space law and especially treaties relating to satellites must be considered. As CNO can interfere with telecommunication systems and always result in data amendments in the working storage of the attacked computer system, both international telecommunications law and international copyright law (in regard to software) require a thorough analysis. In case human rights treaty law is generally applicable, their respective provisions must be considered, especially in regard to secrecy of correspondence, telecommunications and data protection, as well as to the right to receive and impart information and ideas. Restraints for CNO can further result from the provisions of diplomatic and consular law, whenever diplomatic or consular computer systems are involved. Furthermore, it has been asserted that international environmental law principles of good neighbourhood and of the prevention of significant trans-boundary harm would be applicable to CNO in analogy.⁶² In addition, the provisions of\n\n⁶¹ A.

However, first of all, it must be examined under which conditions LOAC applies to CNO (1).\n\n## 1. The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict\n\nAccording to common Article 2 of the GCs, LOAC applies to\n\nall cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.\n\nIn practice, armed conflicts surely can be considered as the main case of application of LOAC. Pursuant to the prevailing opinion an\n\nis taken by the (non-binding) OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems of 1992, which call for cooperation of States (Principle 6) in the area of comprehensive protection of information systems (Principle 4), and which stipulate an imperative of deliberation in the use of information systems (Principle 3), see OECD Doc. OCDE/GD(92)190. However, an analogous application of international environmental law provisions is not convincing because of the lack of an “unintended omission” or of the absence of regulation. International telecommunication law, in particular the provisions of the (almost universally ratified) Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) of 22 December 1992, binds ITU Member States to far-reaching obligations in regard to the protection of communication and information systems (see in particular Articles 6, 33, 38, 45 and 47 of the ITU Constitution).\n\n$^{63}$ These are: Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949; Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949; Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\n\n$^{64}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).\n\n$^{65}$ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977 (entered into force on 7 December 1978).",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\ninternational armed conflict occurs when one or more States have recourse to “armed force” against another State, regardless of the legality, reasons or the intensity of this confrontation.⁶⁶ This opinion is confirmed by the Commentary on the GC which states that “any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2”.⁶⁷ Art. 1(4) AP I extends the definition of international armed conflict to include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination.⁶⁸ A non-international armed conflict within the meaning of the common Article 3 GCs occurs when one or more non-governmental organized armed groups are involved and the situation reaches a certain threshold of confrontation, distinguishing it from internal disturbances, riots or acts of banditry (see also Art. 1 AP II).⁶⁹ Thus, a situation of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and consequently the application of LOAC is given, when States or – under certain circumstances – organized armed groups use “armed force” against the other Party.\n\nUnsurprisingly, LOAC is applicable to all CNO conducted either in support of conventional military operations carried out in the event of an already ongoing armed conflict or conducted as the first step preparing the immediate start of conventional military operations altogether comprising an armed conflict.\n\nWhether “cyber war”, i.e. military operations conducted exclusively by the means of the Internet or other computer networks without the employment of other weaponry (in the following referred to as: “isolated” CNO), will ever per se be classified as “use of armed force” and thus comprise an armed conflict, depends on future State practice.

Furthermore, it will be analysed how the ius in bello terms “attack”, “act of violence” and “hostilities” apply to CNO (B.).\n\n## A. “Isolated” CNO as Armed Conflict\n\nAs stated above, an (international or non-international) armed conflict occurs when States or – under certain circumstances – (a State and/or) organized armed group(s) use “armed force” against each other.\n\nOf course, the notion of “use of armed force” – indicating that differences and confrontations did indeed reach the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict and thus trigger the applicability of the ius in bello – is to be distinguished from the term “use of (armed)” force pursuant to Article 2(4) UN Charter, although the two terms are closely related. Whenever a State conducts actions considered as a “use of armed force” in the meaning of ius ad bellum against another State, this indicates the outbreak of hostilities reaching the level of “use of force” in the meaning of ius in bello and thus the threshold of an armed conflict triggering the applicability of LOAC – with the possible exception of quick, discrete and “surgical” use of force in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter without further retort by the victim (as e.g. the bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osirak/Iraq by Israeli Air Force in 1981).\n\nIn the following, criteria for the assessment whether a particular type of “isolated” CNO constitutes an armed conflict will be developed. The question whether a certain type of CNO can be deemed as “use of armed\n\nTargets? What Rules of Engagement?”, in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 434; see also the remarks by L. Doswald-Beck, 'Some Thoughts on Computer Network Attack and the International Law of Armed Conflict', in Schmitt &amp; O'Donnell, supra note 61, p. 165.\n\n71 Illustrating the different lines of argument in regard to further specification of the term “force”, as used by the UN Charter, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. Therefore, without further explanation in the following it will be assumed that “force” under the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is to be understood as “armed force” as well as forcible measures of physical nature short of an armed attack, which can be defeated by the use of armed force only (e.g. deliberate spreading of fire across a border, cutting the water supply, or causing a widespread cross-boundary flood); see especially in regard to the distinction between the term “force” on the one hand and the terms “economic” or “political coercion” on the other hand, representatively: A.

    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nforce” (in the *ius in bello* meaning) will be examined (while – apart from the above stated exception – exactly the same criteria can indicate whether “use of force” in the meaning of the *ius ad bellum* is given). However, most academic writings on CNO do refer to “use of armed force” in the meaning of Article 2(4) UN Charter. References to such writings will be made when useful and appropriate in the discussion of the term “use of armed force” in the *ius in bello* meaning.\n\nAccording to the traditional understanding, the assumption is that the “use of armed force” requires the employment of kinetic weaponry; that is the employment of a tool designed to cause kinetic effects of physical nature on a body or on an object. CNO are usually neither designed nor intended to directly cause kinetic effects. The transfer of data and its delay or interruption, as well as the manipulation, suppression or deletion of data cannot be deemed to cause kinetic effects in the common meaning of the term. Therefore, a significant qualitative difference between CNO and conventional weapons can be identified. In contrast, some similarities between CNO and biological or chemical weapons (hereinafter referred to as BC weapons) can be conceived. The use of BC weapons does not cause destruction in conventional sense, because these weapons do not set free any kinetic energy.72 The employment of BC weapons is considered as a form of “use of armed force” because, although not resulting in physical destruction of material, these weapons are employed in order to cause death or injury to living things.73 Thus, in the case of BC weapons, the term “weapon” is defined with reference to their effects rather than their method, which perfectly corresponds with the effects-based approach inherent to public international law. Consequently, the majority of scholars rightly insist on an effects-based interpretation of the term of “use of armed force” in the context of CNO.74\n\nTherefore, in the following, different categories of potential effects which can be caused by CNO will be illustrated in order to determine when CNO must be deemed as “use of armed force”.\n\n72 J.

Death, Physical Injury and/or Destruction of Property\n\nAccording to the nearly uniform opinion among scholars (to which the author of the present survey subscribes), a CNO – similarly to the effects caused by BC weapons – should be considered as “use of armed force” if it results in death, physical injury or the destruction of property.75 As illustrated above (II.1.C), CNO can indirectly76 cause such effects.\n\nAccording to a minority view amongst scholars, a CNO, even if it indirectly causes death, physical injury or the destruction of property, qualifies as “use of armed force” only if at the same time it amounts to a “use of structural force”.77 “Structural force” is described in the public international law literature as a physical incursion into a State’s\n\n75 Y.

Schmitt proposes a catalogue of criteria indicating that CNO constitute “use of force”:\n\n- severity of the effects, i.e. threat of physical injury or destruction of property,\n- immediacy of the occurrence of the negative consequences,\n- direct nexus between the CNO and the negative consequences caused,\n- invasiveness of the consequences on foreign territory,\n- measurability of the consequences,\n- pre-assumption of illegitimacy of the CNO according to national rules and to the International Public Law, based on the prima facie illegitimacy of the use of force in international relations (the author of the present survey only guesses that the term “illegitimacy” indeed stands for “illegality”).\n\nSee Schmitt, supra note 28, pp. 65 et seq. This approach is not convincing because of the circular reasoning it contains. It cannot be decided whether a particular act is indeed illegal, by the simultaneous assertion of the illegality of the same act.\n\n76 In the present context the term “indirectly” means that CNO cause immediate effects on the targeted computer systems which only in the consequence result in damages outside the directly affected networks.\n\n77 W.H. von Heinegg, ‘Informationskrieg und Völkerrecht.

According to the prevailing opinion among public international law scholars and the settled jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, an “armed attack” only occurs when the “use of armed force” reaches a certain level of intensity in regard to its effects and scale.80 When this threshold of intensity is not reached, the respective actions in question can still be considered as “use of armed force”, although they do not constitute an “armed attack”.81 Therefore, the above presented view asserting that CNO can only be deemed as “use of force” when it comprises “structural force”, and thus setting the terms of “use of armed force” and “armed attack” equal, is highly questionable.\n\nFurthermore, some scholars demand additional criteria to be met in order to classify CNO as “use of armed force”. This is the direct nexus between the CNO and physical damage, the immediacy of the occurrence of the physical damage (in the sense that the occurrence of the damage does not depend on any additional factors) as well as whether the damage can be foreseen at all.82 However, these criteria determine the conditions of attribution of the damage to a certain action, and are therefore not relevant for the specification of the term “use of armed force”.\n\n78 Randelzhofer, supra note 71, § 21; Sharp, supra note 75, p. 101; also see Judge Schwebel’s dissenting opinion in ICJ, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Destruction of Data\n\nSome academic writings assert that the destruction of data of substantial importance and/or of significant economical value should be considered as “use of armed force”.83 But, in consequence, it would need to have been ascertained in every particular case whether indeed data of some economic value has been destroyed or whether the CNO is to be considered as trivial because the compromised or deleted data is of little or no value. In addition, it must be considered that in the case of a so-called DoS attack84 data will not be destroyed but rather its use and information value will be diminished by delay of its transmission or by temporary denial of access to the data. Furthermore, the effect of CNO directed against data only is not comparable to the effects of conventional weapons, for example a bombardment, or of BC weapons. Therefore, the above presented view is not convincing, as it is of little practical value and could lead to unbearable results.\n\nOther scholars assert that at least the destruction of data symbolizing an asset (e.g. data of an electronically operated banking account) should be considered as “use of armed force”.85 They suggest that this assessment would reflect the obligation to protect civilian objects from dangers arising from military operations.86 However, electronic assets, accounts, demands or claims cannot be equated with objects or physical property and their destruction cannot be compared with the destructive effects on physical property caused by conventional (or BC) weapons. Therefore, the opinion presented above does not capture accurately the translation of the traditional understanding of the term “use of armed force” into the “cyberspace”.\n\nIf, however, a CNO was to be directed against the whole economic or banking system as one of the critical infrastructures of a State, the situation must be judged differently (see III.1.A.v. on critical infrastructure systems).\n\n## iii. “Theft” of Data\n\nMoreover, it is asserted that the “theft” of particular data should be considered as “use of armed force”, if information of vital interest to\n\n83 See Barkham, supra note 72, p. 88.\n84 See supra note 26.\n85 M.N.

Therefore, it is not convincing to view the “theft” of data as comprising an armed conflict.\n\niv. Massive Disruption of Military C3-Systems\n\nAdditionally, some scholars assert that the destruction⁹⁰ or medium to long-term disruption⁹¹ of military command, control and communication systems (C3-systems) is to be deemed as “use of armed force”. Indeed, the intended outcome, namely the disruption of military communications and the consequent restraining ability on military command and control, can be achieved both through the physical destruction of respective systems by conventional weapons and through the massive disruption of the systems by malicious CNO. As such, the effect of a corresponding CNO is quite comparable to the effects of the employment of conventional weapons. This view is supported by Article VI of the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities concluded between the USA and the Soviet Union on 12 June 1989.⁹² According to this provision, the disruption of command and control systems (C2), resulting even in a mere restraint of those systems, would be regarded as a dangerous military activity.

Massive Disruption of Critical Infrastructure Systems\n\nThere is still no uniform opinion among scholars whether massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems⁹³ by means of CNO should be judged as “use of armed force”, if physical effects cannot be identified outside of the targeted computer systems. Partly, it is asserted that the disruption of critical infrastructure systems cannot at all be classified as “use of armed force”, because Article 41 UN Charter would consider the “[...] complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication [...]” as measures employed by the UN Security Council “[...] not involving the use of armed force [...]”⁹⁴ This conclusion is not convincing as the disruption of the above mentioned systems can be caused either by measures not involving or by measures which do involve the “use of armed force”, whereas the latter find their legal basis in Article 42 UN Charter instead of Article 41.\n\nHowever, it is agreed amongst scholars that the effects of a massive disruption of critical infrastructure systems must exceed the threshold of merely minimally affecting the population’s quality of life or must go beyond a mere inconvenience, and must further show effects of disruption of the public life and *ordre public* similar to a bombardment.⁹⁵ This way the effect of a corresponding CNO would indeed be comparable to the effect of the employment of conventional weapons.\n\nConsequently, the assertion can be made that not only the physical destruction but also the disruption of computer networks supporting critical infrastructure systems by means of CNO should be considered as “use of armed force”, provided that the disruption caused can be equated to destruction, i.e. resulting in medium to long-term disruption of the respective systems.⁹⁶ It shall be only mentioned that there is no need to develop practical criteria for the decision when a respective CNO is to be regarded as “use of armed force” as the criteria will perfectly resemble the ones used to identify whether conventional military actions causing\n\n⁹³ See supra section II.1.C.\n\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, supra note 74, p. 912.\n\n⁹⁵ Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 7.\n\n⁹⁶ Terry, supra note 69, pp. 428 et seq.; and Morth, supra note 61, p. 599.

Intermediate Result\n\nAll in all, only “isolated” CNO which cause deaths, physical injuries, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State can be considered as “use of armed force” and thus constitute an armed conflict.\n\nB. Malicious CNO as “Attacks”, “Acts of Violence” or “Hostilities”\n\nAs far as LOAC provisions refer to “attacks”97, “acts of violence”98 or “hostilities”99 it can be asserted that they apply to malicious CNO which are to be considered as “use of armed force”. Consequently, a CNO could be considered as an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello), an “act of violence” or as “hostilities” if it – indirectly – caused death, physical injury, destruction of property or the (medium to long-term) disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a State.\n\n2. Restraints for Malicious CNO Resulting from LOAC Provisions\n\nIn the following, LOAC provisions, as reflected in the Hague Conventions, the universal100 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as well as other treaties, will be examined.\n\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions entered into force long before the Internet era. The Additional Protocols entered into force in 1978, at a time when computers already existed, but the Internet in its present form and extent did not. Therefore, the textual analysis of the wording of relevant LOAC provisions covers the execution of malicious CNO only when the act referred to can also be committed by the use of the telecommunication means of the Internet, e.g. in regard to disseminating information, which contains threats of violence, the primary purpose of\n\n97 See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52 (1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n\n98 See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II.\n\n99 See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n\n100 Presently, 194 States are Parties to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (and thus two more States than Parties to the United Nations Charter, usually referred to as a universal treaty). The present status of ratifications to the Hague Conventions of 1907 and Geneva Conventions of 1949 as well as to their Additional Protocols of 1977 is available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO?OpenView.\n\n75",
    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nwhich is to spread terror among the civilian population, as prohibited in Article 51(2) AP I. Obviously, the systematic and historic interpretation of the treaties does not offer any further insight. However, the relevant provisions reveal surprising actuality, when a teleological interpretation of the rules is applied, i.e. the spirit and purpose of a particular provision is examined. In the following, this will be applied in regard to prohibitions in regard to methods and means of warfare (a) and lawful targets (b).\n\n## A. Prohibited Methods and Means of Warfare\n\n### i. Perfidy\n\nArticle 23(f) HR in conjunction with Articles 38 and 39 AP I as well as Article 12 AP II prohibit the misuse of distinctive emblems, signs, signals or flags of protected entities¹⁰¹, including those of the Red Cross and its associated entities and of the United Nations. Furthermore, the provisions ban the misuse of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Party to the particular armed conflict as well as of the adversary Party (though, in regard to the latter only while engaging in attack or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations).¹⁰² Moreover, Article 44(3) AP I states the obligation for all members of the armed forces to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.\n\nAlthough the above-mentioned provisions refer to physically visible symbols carried by individuals or objects, the rules can also be observed in the \"cyberspace\". The spirit and purpose of these provisions is to preserve the neutrality of certain entities and to protect certain groups against dangers arising from military operations. Therefore, Parties to an armed conflict must not misuse the identity of these entities or groups. Consequently, the \"cyber identity\" (i.e. website, e-mail address, email header, IP address and other technical data sent while connected to the Internet) of one of the protected organisations or groups must not be used at any time during the conduct of CNO. A simple example of the ban would be that the header of an e-mail sent to adversary armed forces, containing a virus, indirectly causing physical damage outside the targeted network, must not show, for instance, the Red Cross as the\n\n¹⁰¹ Also see the Annex I to the AP I.\n\n¹⁰² Exceptions to those rules are stated in Article 39(3) AP I in regard to espionage and to the conduct of armed conflict at sea.",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nsender. Also, while hacking adversary computer networks, the CNO forces must not feign technical data, which would lead to presumption of the “cyber identity” of a civilian if the concrete CNO conducted is to be considered as an “attack” or an “act preparatory to an attack” in the meaning of Article 44(3) AP I. Moreover, any respective manipulation of websites belonging to the protected entities would be illegal.\n\nIn addition, the prohibition of Article 23(b) HR in conjunction with Article 37(1) AP I, to kill, injure or capture an adversary under recourse to perfidy, applies to CNO. In general terms, perfidy describes an act which leads the adversary to erroneously believe that he or she is entitled to, or is obliged to accord protection under LOAC (see the definition of perfidy in Article 37(1) AP I). The ban covers, inter alia, intentional dissemination of misinformation to the adversary Party about the intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender, or about an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, as well as feigning civilian, non-combatant or protected status (e.g. of a United Nations employee or of a member of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, by using respective emblems, signs, signals or uniforms, see Art. 23(f) HR and Art. 37(1) AP I). The aforementioned misinformation can generally be transmitted by the means of the Internet, for example by e-mail or as a statement on a website. As already stated (e.g. supra II.2.), the “cyber-identity” of the aforementioned protected persons can easily be feigned in the “cyberspace”. However, the above described dissemination of misinformation or feigning of the (cyber) identity of a protected person is prohibited only if it directly¹⁰³ results in the death, injury or capture of the adversary.\n\nConversely, legal ruses of war in the sense of Article 24 HR and Article 37(2) AP I, which are merely aimed to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly, offer a broad field of application to CNO. Thus, it is imaginable that a Party to an armed conflict establishes a so-called honey net around its own computer network, i.e. an outside-network building a buffer around its own computer network, which is only minimally protected against hacking and, technically speaking,\n\n¹⁰³ The specific nexus between the dissemination of misinformation or feigning of a protected status on the one hand and the death, injury or capture of the adversary on the other hand is required in order to establish accountability of armed forces, as – in the traditional understanding of warfare – all military actions always pursue death, injury or capture of the adversary, see M. Bothe, K.J. Partsch &amp; W.A. Solf, *New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts. Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949* (The Hague / Boston / London, Martinus Nijhoff, 1982), Art. 37 (1) AP I, no. 2.4, p. 204.",
    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nappears perfectly realistic, but contains false information, for example on planned military operations or on the status of own forces and their location. Such a honey net could be established specifically in the hope that the adversary Party would compromise it and – in this way – obtain false information.\n\n## ii. Methods or Means of Warfare Prohibited Because of the Nature of Their Effects\n\nSome methods or means of warfare are prohibited because of the nature of their effects.\n\nAccording to Article 51(2) AP I and Article 13(2) AP II, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. This ban refers to the dissemination of certain information to the civilian population. As this information could be easily transmitted by means of computer-based information systems, for example via e-mail or as information on a website, this prohibition must be considered during the planning and the conduct of CNO.\n\nFurthermore, Article 23(e) HR, Article 35(2) AP I, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980 and its Protocols¹⁰⁴ as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 prohibit the employment of methods or means of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Equally, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57(2)(a)(iii) AP I stipulate that an attack which may be expected to cause loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. As it is perfectly possible that a cyber attack could indirectly cause physical damage (see supra II.1.C), it must be examined beforehand whether the anticipated (indirect) effect would be excessive in the sense of the above-mentioned provisions.¹⁰⁵ In this regard, as the expected effects of concrete CNO\n\n¹⁰⁴ Those are: Protocol on Non-Detectable Fragments (Protocol I) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) of 1980, Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III) of 1980, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV) of 1995, and Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V) of 2003.\n\n¹⁰⁵ See E.T. Jensen, ‘Unexpected Consequences from Knock-Out Effects: A Different",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nare to be assessed, the practical criteria for the examination resemble to ones for the analysis of the effects caused by other (e.g. conventional) weapons.\n\nMoreover, according to Article 51(4) AP I indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Attacks are deemed to be indiscriminate, when they are not or cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or when their effects cannot be limited (see Art. 51(4)(a)-(c) AP I). It is perfectly possible that CNO equated to an “attack” (in the meaning of ius in bello) or an “act of violence” (see III.1.B.) could have indiscriminate effects, in the case of global, uncontrolled spreading of viruses, bugs and – in future – micro-mechanical organisms via the Internet. However, damaging software could be programmed in such a way so as to only target computer systems with specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. An uncontrolled spread of malware, as well as any cascade effects, could be easily prevented by appropriate programming.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of malicious CNO will not achieve the quality of a “method or means of combat, the effects of which are indiscriminate”. The inductive conclusion drawn from the examples given by Articles 51(4)(a) and (b) AP I shows that the provisions refer to methods or means of combat which result in physically “devastating” physical effects.\n\nFinally, Article 35(3) in connection with Article 55(1) AP I prohibits the employment of methods or means of warfare which may be expected to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. This provision covers only especially extensive, intensive and long-lasting environmental damage, which exceeds the scale of both the quality and quantity of “ordinary” environmental damage which is expected to occur in the course of combat.[108] Severe damage of the natural environment can always be caused when dangerous forces are set free, such as by radiation escaping from a nuclear power plant, the explosion of a chemical or pharmacy installation, or the breaking of a dam or dyke. As such effects could be caused indirectly by CNO\n\nStandard for Computer Network Operations?', Vol. 18 American University LL.Rev. 2003, pp. 1178 et seq.; and Schmitt, supra note 28, p. 82.\n106 See also M.N.

    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\n(see supra II.1.C), the prohibition of Article 35(3) AP I must be also considered for operations primarily conducted within “cyberspace”.\n\n## B. Prohibited Targets\n\nFurthermore, LOAC provisions granting protection for non-combatants and for civilian objects are of significance for CNO.\n\n### i. Civilians Population and Individual Civilians\n\nThe civilian population as a whole, as well as individual civilians (see Art. 50 AP I), are protected against “attacks”¹⁰⁹, “acts of violence”¹¹⁰ and “effects of hostilities”¹¹¹. Accordingly, CNO which are not deemed as being “use of force”, and thus not comprising an “attack” (in the meaning of *ius in bello*), “act of violence” or “effect of hostilities” (see supra III.1.B) would not be contrary to LOAC and – from the perspective of international humanitarian law – could legally be directed against civilians¹¹².\n\nConversely, CNO considered as being a “use of force” could only be directed against civilians launching malicious CNO against the armed forces constituting “direct participation in hostilities” within the meaning of Article 51(3) AP I and Article 13(3) AP II¹¹³. In order to distinguish between private hacking as “direct participation in hostilities” and hacking as a mere criminal act, all circumstances of a specific case must be taken into consideration (see also supra II.2).\n\nFurthermore, according to Article 48 AP I, the Parties to an armed conflict must, at all times, distinguish between the civilian population\n\n¹⁰⁹ See e.g. Articles 49(1), 51, 52(1) and 54(2) AP I and Articles 11(1), 13 (2), 14 and 15 AP II.\n¹¹⁰ See e.g. Articles 49(1) and 50(2) AP I and Art. 13(2) AP II.\n¹¹¹ See e.g. Articles 43(2), 44(3), 45, 49(4) and 51(3) AP I and Articles 4(1)(3) and 13(3) AP II.\n¹¹² Concurring: Schmitt, supra note 106, p. 378.\n¹¹³ The examination of the different approaches to the question of the direct participation of civilians in hostilities, and especially of the temporal scope of the loss of protection otherwise granted by international humanitarian law, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further examination, the following literature may be recommended selectively: N. Melzer, *Interpretative Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities* (Geneva, ICRC, May 2009), available at www.icrc.org; Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 51 AP I, no. 2.4.2.2., p. 303; M.N. Schmitt, ‘Direct Participation in Hostilities and 21st Century Armed Conflict’, in H. Fischer, U. Froissart, W.H. von Heinegg &amp; C. Raap (Hrsg.), *Krisensicherung und humanitärer Schutz – Crisis Management and Humanitarian Protection. Festschrift für Dieter Fleck* (Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), pp. 505–529.",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nand combatants. Admittedly, the conventional (visual) criteria for the identification of a combatant as set out in Articles 43 and 44 AP I are not helpful for CNO, during which the acting individuals are not physically visible.¹¹⁴ However, the obligation to distinguish can also be met within “cyberspace”. In the “virtual world”, a computer of a combatant can be distinguished from the computer of a non-combatant according to its IP address and other technical data automatically sent during an Internet session. It can easily be verified by everybody in one of the official WhoIs?¹¹⁵ Internet databases to which person or entity a specific IP address or an IP address range is assigned. In addition, the “owner” and the responsible administrators of websites can be found in the WhoIs? databases. Thus, in principle it can be confirmed whether a particular actor in the “virtual world” should be considered as a member of the armed forces or as a civilian.\n\nNevertheless, some challenges as to the identification of a person acting in the “cyberspace” as a combatant will remain. For example, a member of regular armed forces and thus a combatant will not be recognizable as such when using his private computer at home, the latter sending during an Internet session information identifying the user as a civilian. This resembles the “real world” situation, when a soldier is not wearing the uniform when being at home and thus cannot visually be identified as a combatant as well. Thus, the remaining challenges are not new and will mostly resemble similar “real world” cases.\n\n## ii. Civilian Objects\n\nAccording to Article 48 AP I, civilian objects must be distinguished from military objectives. Civilian objects must not be the objects of attack or reprisals (Articles 48, 52(1)-(2) and 57 AP I, see also Art. 23(g) HR and further specific regulations in Articles 53–56 AP I and Articles 14–16 AP II). Generally, this principle of distinction, as well as the above-mentioned prohibitions, can also be observed within the “virtual world”.\n\n¹¹⁴ See the profound examination by S. Watts, ‘Combatant Status and Computer Network Attack’, Vol. 50 No. 2 Virginia J.I.L. 2010, pp. 391–447.\n\n¹¹⁵ The WhoIs? databases of the RIRs (see supra note 58) provide information on which IP address is assigned to which end customer (in the case of dynamic IP-addresses: to which Internet Service Provider). Thus, the database DENIC (available at http://www.denic.de) provides respective information on “.de” domains, and the database RIPE (available at http://www.ripe.net) on the other domains in Europe, InterNIC (available at http://www.internic.net/whois.html) on the domains “com”, “edu”, “int”, “net” or “org”. The database Network Information Center (available at http://www.nic.com) leads to official and regional WhoIs? databases as well as to respective private databases available online.",
    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nViruses, bugs and – in the future – micro-mechanical organisms can be programmed in such a way that they only affect military computer networks, namely those with corresponding IP addresses or IP address ranges. The identification of a computer or computer system as military or civilian can be made by a search request of a specific IP address in one of the Whols? databases (see supra III.2.B.i).\n\nMalicious CNO against a purely military computer network, such as the Intranet or other communication systems of armed forces supported by the Intranet, would be perfectly legal in regard to LOAC. CNO launched against civilian computer networks – in case they are not to be considered as military objectives pursuant to Article 52(2) AP I – would only be allowed when they are not to be considered as an “attack” in the sense of Article 49(1) AP I, i.e. would not cause any physical damage (see supra III.1.B). A mere suppression or denial of access of the civilian population to a computer network or to specific data as well as the mere manipulation or the deletion of particular data would not fall under the prohibition of attack, as long as physical damage in- or outside the directly affected networks is not caused. For example, the deletion of a particular electronically operated bank account of a civilian would not be forbidden as a matter of LOAC.\n\nDistinction between civilian objects and military objectives becomes difficult when a computer network is used by both combatants and non-combatants (so-called dual use objects). This applies especially to the global Internet where, apart from the civilian population, there is a high probability that it will also be used by Parties to an armed conflict for the purposes of communication and information gathering. According to some scholars, the Internet is to be deemed as a military objective as soon as it is also used for military purposes.[116] Considering that nowadays the Internet is as an equally important means of communication as telephone and telegraph connections were in the past, the aforementioned opinion is supported by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had already in 1956 classified the latter as military objectives.[117]\n\n[116] This assertion is made in general terms, referring to communication networks used for both military and civilian purposes by Jensen, supra note 105, pp. 1160 et seq.; J.P. Terry, ‘The Lawfulness of Attacking Computer Networks in Armed Conflict and in Self-Defense in Period Short of Armed Conflict: What are the Targeting Constrains?’, Vol. 169 Mil. L. Rev. 2001, p. 85; and Stein &amp; Marauhn, supra note 62, p. 35.

    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nHowever, some scholars refuse to classify civilian means of communication merely co-used for military purposes as a military objective.¹¹⁸ Indeed, in order to avoid any “automatism”, a thorough examination of the definition of a military objective provided by Article 52(2) AP I will be necessary. The definition clearly refers to objects only. Thus, at first sight, it seems doubtful whether the “virtual world” of the Internet can be deemed to be an object. However, the computer system Internet is not a purely intellectual construction. It comprises a multitude of objects, including technical equipment as servers, cables, cross points and access points; thus, the provision is in general applicable to the Internet. According to this definition, the computer system Internet or any other (dual use) computer network is to be considered as a military objective, if\n\n- the computer network makes an effective contribution¹¹⁹ to military action by its use, and\n- the total or partial destruction or neutralization of the computer network offered a definite (i.e. concrete and perceptible)¹²⁰ military advantage (in regard to the overall military operation).¹²¹\n\nWhether the Internet meets these conditions depends on the degree to which the other Party to the armed conflict uses the Internet, and whether this Party can easily revert to alternative communication means. Therefore, the characterisation of the Internet, or other dual use computer networks, as a military objective depends on the circumstances of the specific situation, especially on the degree of the dependence of the adversary Party on those networks, *ergo* on the level of the technologisation of the adversary armed forces.\n\nEven if the Internet was to be considered to be a military objective in the context of a particular armed conflict, it must be considered that it would be allowed to be attacked only as far as its physical elements\n\nby the Civilian Population in Time of War, see Fleck, supra note 66, § 443. von Heinegg, supra note 77, pp. 150 seq.\n\n¹¹⁸ The examination, whether the “contribution” shall have a particular significance for or shall merely support a certain military operation, would certainly exceed the scope of this survey. For further details see Fleck, supra note 66, § 442; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.3., p. 324.\n\n¹²⁰ See R. Wedgwood, ‘Proportionality, Cyberwar and the Law of War’, in Schmitt &amp; O’Donnell, supra note 61, p. 225; and von Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 150.\n\n¹²¹ Wedgwood, supra note 120, p. 225; Heinegg, supra note 77, p. 149; Fleck, supra note 66, § 444; and Bothe, Partsch &amp; Solf, supra note 103, Art. 52 AP I, § 2.4.4.

But, even if such an attack was conducted successfully, a connection to the Internet could still be made from the same geographical area, for example via a mobile phone or other device enabled with respective software permitting Internet connectivity. Thus, an attack against the Internet intending the *quasi* disabling of a network within the area of conflict is unlikely to succeed.¹²³\n\n### iii. Objects under Special Protection\n\nAdditionally, LOAC provides special protection against attacks and reprisals for specific civilian objects. Corresponding prohibitions can be found in Article 27 HR, Articles 19-21 GC I., Articles 22 and 24 GC II., Articles 18 *et seq.* GC IV, Article 4 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954 and in its Protocol I of 1954 and Protocol II of 1999, Articles 12, 21, 24 *et seq.*, 54(2) and (4) and 56 AP I as well as in Articles 11 and 14–16 AP II. Pursuant to these provisions, special protection is provided for dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (*inter alia* drinking water installations and water irrigation works), medical units and transportation, historic monuments, works of art or places of worship etc. As far as incorporating computer-based elements, the above-mentioned objects could be disrupted or even destroyed by the means of a cyber attack. Therefore, the computer-based cooling system of a nuclear power plant, for example, must not be disabled by remote control, a drinking water installation must not be destroyed by a computer controlled opening and closing of its valves, a medical aircraft must not be caused to crash by manipulation of data of an air traffic control system, or a museum protected by *ius in bello* must not be flooded by the remote activation of a water sprinkler system.\n\n¹²² In general terms, a *Wireless Local Area Network* (WLAN) describes a local wireless and direct connection between two or more mobile end devices (*clients*), which are equipped with a wireless access device. Usually, *clients* access the Internet via a central bridge (so-called *access point*). The bridge has a *router*, which – based on a *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol* (DHPC server) – assigns a dynamic IP address to each *host* (see also *supra* note 58) seeking connectivity to the Internet.\n\n¹²³ In order to disable the Internet, all its thirteen *root servers* (i.e. the main *domain name servers* or the main server layer of the internet) would have to be disconnected or destroyed. For security reasons, those servers are located in different, secret sites which are geographically distant. It is asserted that disabling up to ten of the *root servers* would probably merely delay the data transfer via the Internet.",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nGenerally speaking, the aforementioned provisions, which provide special protection for specific civilian objects, can cease in the event that the objects are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy or for regular, significant and direct support for military operations of the enemy. In general terms, an active counter-CNO (back-hacking) could be legally launched once a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit to stop the forbidden activities, and after such warning has remained unheeded. For example, in the case of the computer network of a medical unit, if it had been identified as the location of origin of malicious CNO, as an exception, an active counter-CNO could be launched if a warning about the forthcoming back-hacking had been given in advance, for instance in the form of a pop-up window which would appear on the computer screen of the cyber attacker.\n\nIt should also be considered that as far as an attack against an object is forbidden, the enemy must not be led to attack such objects. Therefore, CNO which would correspondingly manipulate a targeting database of the adversary Party to the armed conflict in order to assign the data of the geographical coordinates of a civilian object under special protection to the data of a military objective of the adversary Party would be forbidden. As an example, when manipulating the adversary's targeting database, a munitions factory must not be assigned the geographical coordinates of a hospital.\n\n## 3. The Law of Neutrality and the Cyberspace\n\nFirst of all, neutrality in the sense of *ius in bellum* has to be distinguished from permanent neutrality (e.g. the cases of Austria, the Holy See, and Switzerland), i.e. the legal obligation undertaken in peacetime to remain neutral in cases of armed conflict or war between other States, and from the mere neutrality policy (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Ireland), which, nonetheless, can have some legally binding effects due to the situation of confidence created in which other States may rely on the (political) declarations to remain neutral (principle of estoppel).¹²⁴\n\n## A. The Applicability of the Law of Neutrality\n\nNeutrality is a particular status of a State not Party to an armed conflict of significant scope or – according to a traditional view – to a “war\n\n¹²⁴ Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1105.",
    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nin the legal sense” between other States.¹²⁵ Although it is not crucial for the purposes of the present survey to decide which view is to be followed, it may be mentioned that the International Court of Justice stated in its Advisory Opinion on the *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* of 8 July 1996 that “[...] the principle of neutrality [...] is applicable [...], to all international armed conflict, whatever type of weapons might be used”.¹²⁶ However, it must always be taken into consideration that in particular cases the rules governing neutrality may be modified by collective self-defence provisions such as Article 51 UN Charter and Article 5 North Atlantic Treaty (depriving a State of the possibility to legally join an armed conflict or a war on the side of the aggressor) and by (binding) decisions taken by the UN Security Council (see Articles 2(5) and 25 and Chapter VII UN Charter; the obligation to assist any action taken by the UN in accordance with the Charter would forestall a State to appeal to its neutrality).¹²⁷\n\nIn the following it will be shown that the rules on neutrality – which are over 100 years old – apply to military operations conducted in cyberspace (during an armed conflict of significant scope or a “war in the legal sense”). When examining the law of neutrality, no difference will be made between the specific rules applying to land, air or sea warfare, as the distinction between these areas is not relevant to CNO.\n\n## B. Prohibition of CNO Causing Physical Damage\n\nFirst and foremost, the rules of neutrality protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the neutral State, see Article 1 Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907 (HC V) and Art. 1 Hague Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War of 1907 (HC XIII).\n\nThus, the principle of neutrality prohibits causing physical damage on the sovereign territory of a neutral State.¹²⁸ Consequently, a malicious\n\n¹²⁵ The discussion of the question, whether rules on neutrality apply in situations of war (in legal sense) only or also in situations of an armed conflict of significant scope, would exceed the scope of the present survey. Interested readers may be referred to the assessment in Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1106.\n\n¹²⁶ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90 (emphasis by the author).\n\n¹²⁷ See further details at Fleck, *supra* note 66, § 1103; and G.

Transnational L.* 2000, pp. 1079 et seq.\n\n¹²⁸ ICI, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, §§ 88–90. Regarding the necessary criteria of a “physical encroachment”\n\n86",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nCNO would only breach the principle of the territorial inviolability of a neutral State if it – indirectly – caused physical damage (deaths, injuries or destruction of property) on the territory of a neutral State or medium to long-term disruption of critical infrastructure systems of a neutral State (see supra III.1.A.vi). In this regard, the physical damage could refer to physical components (technical equipment) of the Internet and/or other computer systems as well as to objects/living beings outside the affected computer systems.\n\nIn regard to critical infrastructure systems, it must always be considered that they can be shared by several States (e.g. an electricity distribution system is shared between Laos and Thailand, between Venezuela and Brazil, between Canada and the United States and between Indonesia and Singapore; one telecommunication system is shared by several States in East and South-East Asia).[129] Thus, before targeting a critical infrastructure system of the adversary it must always be examined (in addition to other LOAC provisions relevant to targeting) whether the estimated damage could also automatically affect another State neutral to the particular armed conflict or war.\n\n# C. The Use of Telecommunication Means Belonging to a Neutral State\n\nAccording to Article 8 HC V, a neutral State can allow the belligerents to use \"telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals\". The neutral State also has the right to restrict or prohibit the use of such communication means, if applied (by the State, companies or individuals) impartially to all belligerents (see Article 9 HC V and 9(1) HC XIII).\n\nIn regard to the Internet, such a restriction or prohibition could be enforced by a neutral State by applying certain software to all Internet cross points located on its territory. The software would scan the Internet traffic for data packages sent by the belligerents and delete them. Of course, a neutral State could also disable all technical components supporting the worldwide network Internet and located on its territory. This way, the belligerents would not use the Internet components located on the territory of the neutral State, although the Internet system as such would continue to function and could be further used by the Parties to the armed conflict or war.\n\nsee Greenberg, Goodman &amp; Soo Hoo, supra note 75, p. 10.\n129 W. Church, ‘Information Warfare’, Vol. 82 No. 837 I.R.R.C. 2000, p. 210.",
    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nIn the case one Party of the armed conflict or war used the computer network located on the territory of a neutral State to send malicious CNO to the computer systems of the other belligerent – either by launching malicious CNO from neutral State’s territory or by using Internet cross points or other technical equipment located on its territory –, the neutral State would have the right to “protect” its neutral status by taking appropriate actions (e.g. back-hacking). If it failed to do so, the neutral State would have – pursuant to the principle of non-discrimination of belligerents – the obligation to allow the affected belligerent to take action against the malicious CNO.^[130]^\n\n## D. Data Streams Passing the Territory of a Neutral State\n\nHowever, it is perfectly possible, even likely, that in the course of the conduct of CNO the data stream carrying malicious components (e.g. viruses or worms) to the adversary’s computer systems passes Internet crossing points and servers located on the territory of a neutral State. However, this would not result in violation of neutrality law.\n\nFirst of all, a Party to a conflict cannot influence whether a data stream crosses the technical components of the Internet situated on the territory of a neutral State or not. Every data stream sent via the Internet is divided in data packages, each one of which takes – out of millions possible routs – a certain route from cross point to cross point around the globe. The respective choices are done automatically by the Internet system (depending on the traffic load on the routes) and cannot be foreseen or influenced.^[131]^\n\nFurthermore, according to Article 3(a) HC V and Article 5 HC XIII, a Party to an armed conflict or war is only forbidden to “[e]rect on the territory [including territorial waters] of a neutral Power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea”, and pursuant to Article 3(b) HC V to “[u]se any installation of this kind established by them [i.e. belligerents] before the war on the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes, and which has not been opened for the service of public messages”. This means that belligerents are allowed to use all non-purely military means of communication erected or established on the territory of a neutral State – by whomever – before the armed conflict or war. This would apply to all technical installations on the territory of\n\n^[130]^ Jensen, *supra* note 105, pp. 238 et seq.\n^[131]^ Walker, *supra* note 127, pp. 1079 et seq.\n\n88",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nthe neutral State being part of the worldwide, already existing computer network Internet, as it is – also historically – a communication means used by civilians also. It is asserted within academic writings that the establishment of a connection to the Internet as such should be deemed as similar to the forbidden “erecting” of a “communication apparatus”.¹³² However, it is more convincing to compare the establishment of a connection to the Internet to connecting to the worldwide telephone system by dialling a phone number – which would surely not be considered as forbidden “erecting” a “communication apparatus” by a belligerent.\n\nFinally, it must be endorsed that, because the law of neutrality does provide special provisions referring to communication systems on land or in territorial waters (Art. 3 HC V and Art. 5 HC XIII), there is no need or space for an (analogous) application of rules relating to the innocent passage through territorial waters, as asserted in some scholar writings.¹³³\n\n## IV. Concluding Remarks\n\nGiven the developments in technology and reliance on computer systems, in the future, CNO are likely to be of considerable significance for the planning and conduct of military operations. One of the reasons is that both the equipment and the conduct of CNO are extremely inexpensive when compared to conventional military operations. In addition, CNO can be conducted by only a few experts and from any location distant from the (traditional) area of combat, which safeguards the physical protection of the members of armed forces involved. Furthermore, as mentioned above, within the context of so-called asymmetric warfare, CNO can be a powerful weapon in the hands of non-state actors against the technologically highly developed armed forces of post-industrial States sensitive to malfunctions of their computer networks.\n\nOwing to the potential physical effects of CNO, the Parties to any future armed conflict in which CNO will be carried out, either in support of conventional military abilities or as the only method of war fighting conducted, will have to observe relevant LOAC provisions. The spirit and purpose of these protection granting rules, as well as the values they reflect, are timeless. They offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n\n¹³² *Id.*\n\n¹³³ Such an assertion is made by Walker, *supra* note 127.",
    "REVUE DE DROIT MILITAIRE ET DE DROIT DE LA GUERRE 49/1-2 (2010)\n\nNeither a lack of regulation nor a need for amendment of “aged” norms can be identified, when a teleological interpretation of the provisions is applied.\n\nThe future practice of the armed forces will show whether adjustments in the interpretation of relevant LOAC provisions will have to be made. The practice of the international community will decide, whether in the future it will be considered necessary to increase the level of the humanitarian protection during armed conflicts, and thus to include protection e.g. of data contained in computers or computer networks of non-combatants. Unquestionably, lawyers advising armed forces will have ever more to deal with corresponding questions of law and to understand the technical details of CNO as an emerging weapon, means or method of war.\n\n90",
    "MILITARY LAW AND THE LAW OF WAR REVIEW 49/1-2 (2010)\n\n## Summary – Résumé – Samenvatting – Zusammenfassung – Riassunto – Resumen\n\n## Summary – Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\n\nThe Internet has become the most essential means of communication and information. This results in a high dependency upon reliable operations of Internet based communication systems, especially those supporting critical infrastructure systems. Given the shortcomings of the Internet with regard to security, the vulnerability of computer systems has become a significant matter of (national or collective) security to many States as well as to NATO. The potential conduct of “Computer Network Operations” (CNO), i.e. military defensive or offensive actions taken by the means of the Internet or other computer networks, presents some legal challenges. This survey first examines the nature of CNO and discusses the difficulties of identification of the origin and of attribution of a malicious action carried out via or in the cyberspace to a certain actor. After the presentation of some criteria for the qualification of CNO as “use of armed force” (in the *ius in bello* meaning), the survey argues that the Laws of Armed Conflict, including the over hundred years old principles and provisions of neutrality, do apply to CNO. At the same time, it demonstrates that the provisions offer a level of humanitarian protection comparable to that applicable to the use of conventional weapons.\n\n## Résumé – Les Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques et le Droit des Confits Armés\n\nL’internet est devenu un moyen de communication et d’information indispensable. Il en résulte une grande dépendance envers la fiabilité du fonctionnement des systèmes de communication basé sur l’internet, particulièrement ceux au soutien d’infrastructures critiques. Étant donné les insuffisances de l’internet en matière de sécurité, la vulnérabilité des systèmes d’ordinateurs est devenue un sujet important pour la sécurité (nationale et collective) de plusieurs États ainsi que pour l’OTAN. La conduite éventuelle d’Opérations contre les Réseaux Informatiques (OCRI), à savoir des actions militaires offensives ou défensives prises grâce aux moyens mêmes de l’internet ou de réseaux d’ordinateurs, présente quelques défis juridiques. Cet article examine d’abord la nature des OCRI et discute des difficultés associées à l’identification de l’origine et de l’attribution à un acteur précis d’une action malicieuse\n\n91",

Après avoir présenté quelques critères pour qualifier les OCRI comme étant une utilisation de la force armée (au sens *ius in bello*) l'auteur soutient ensuite que le droit des conflits armés ainsi que les principes et dispositions plus que centenaire en matière de neutralité s'appliquent aux OCRI. Par la même occasion, l'article démontre que ces dispositions offrent un niveau de protection humanitaire qui est comparable à celui en vigueur pour l'utilisation des armes classiques.\n\n## Samenvatting – Computer netwerk operaties en het humanitair oorlogsrecht\n\nHet Internet is uitgegroeid tot het belangrijkste communicatie- en informatiemiddel. Dit heeft geleid tot een grote afhankelijkheid van op Internet gebaseerde communicatiesystemen, vooral van die systemen die kritische infrastructuur ondersteunen. Door de beperkingen van het Internet op het gebied van beveiliging, is de kwetsbaarheid van computersystemen een zaak van (nationale of collectieve) veiligheid geworden voor veel staten en voor de NAVO. Computer netwerk operaties (CNO), dat wil zeggen defensieve of offensieve militaire handelingen door middel van Internet of andere computernetwerken, roept juridische vragen op. Dit artikel onderzoekt eerst wat CNO is en bespreekt de moeilijkheden rond het identificeren van de bron van en toerekening aan een bepaalde actor van een vijandige handeling die in of via cyberspace wordt uitgevoerd. Nadat een aantal criteria voor de kwalificatie van CNO als geweldgebruik (in de zin van het *ius in bello*) zijn geponeerd, beargumenteert het artikel dat het humanitair oorlogsrecht, waaronder de principes en regels betreffende neutraliteit die meer dan honderd jaar oud zijn, zich lenen voor toepassing op CNO. Aangetoond wordt dat de bepalingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht binnen dit domein een niveau van bescherming bieden dat vergelijkbaar is met het niveau dat van toepassing is op het gebruik van conventionele wapens.\n\n## Zusammenfassung – Computernetwerkoperationen und das humanitäre Völkerrecht\n\nDas Internet wurde zu einem essentiellen Kommunikations- und Informationsmittel unserer Zeit.

Da das Internet in Bezug auf die Sicherheit Mängel aufweist, wurde die Integrität von Computersystemen für manche Staaten so wie auch für die NATO zu einer Frage der (nationalen bzw. kollektiven) Sicherheit. Das potenzielle Durchführen von Computernetzwerkoperationen (CNO), d.h. defensiven oder offensiven Handlungen der Streitkräfte unter Inanspruchnahme des Internet oder anderer Computernetzwerke, bietet einige Herausforderungen rechtlicher Art. In dem vorliegenden Artikel wird zunächst die Natur von CNO dargelegt. Ferner werden die Schwierigkeiten in Bezug auf die Identifizierung des Ursprungs und die Zurechnung einer im virtuellen Raum vorgenommenen schädigenden Handlung zu einem bestimmten Akteur erörtert. Nachdem einige Kriterien für die Einordnung von CNO als „Anwendung bewaffneter Gewalt“ (im Sinne des *ius in bello*) vorgestellt werden, wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht, einschließlich der über hundert Jahre alten Prinzipien und Regelungen des Neutralitätsrechts, auf CNO anwendbar ist. Zugleich wird dargelegt, dass das humanitäre Völkerrecht hierbei einen humanitären Schutzstandard bietet, der demjenigen gleicht, der bei der Anwendung konventioneller Waffen gilt.\n\n## Riassunto – Computer Network Operations e il diritto dei conflitti armati\n\nLa rete internet è divenuta il più importante mezzo di comunicazione ed informazione dell’era contemporanea. Ciò determina una sostanziale dipendenza dal corretto funzionamento dei sistemi di comunicazione basati su tale rete, specialmente per ciò che concerne quelli di sostegno ad infrastrutture critiche. Vista la scarsa sicurezza della comunicazione via internet, la vulnerabilità dei sistemi informatici è diventata una questione di rilievo per la sicurezza (nazionale o collettiva) di molti stati e per la NATO. La potenziale condotta di ‘Operazioni militari su reti informatiche’ (*Computer Network Operations – CNO*), ovvero operazioni militari difensive o offensive scatenate tramite internet o per altra via informatica, presenta tuttavia talune incertezze dal punto di vista giuridico. Dapprima questo articolo esamina la vera natura delle CNO, mettendo in luce le difficoltà di identificazione e attribuzione di un’azione delittuosa portata avanti nello spazio cibernetico (o mediante quest’ultimo), a danno di un determinato soggetto. Successivamente, dopo aver presentato alcuni criteri guida per una corretta qualificazione delle CNO come un vero e proprio “uso della forza armata” (secondo lo *ius in bello*), l’articolo dimostra che il diritto dei conflitti armati, assieme agli ultra-centenari principi e norme sulla neutralità, trova applicazione",

Allo stesso modo, lo scritto evidenzia come tali norme offrano un livello di protezione umanitaria comparabile con quello applicabile nel caso di uso di armi convenzionali.\n\n## Resumen – Operaciones a través de la red informática y Derecho de los Conflictos Armados.\n\nInternet ha acabado por convertirse en un importante medio de comunicación e información de la era contemporánea. Esto lleva consigo un alto grado de dependencia con respecto a los sistemas de comunicación centrados en la red, especialmente por lo que se refiere a los sistemas que sirven de apoyo a infraestructuras vitales. Vista la escasa seguridad de las comunicaciones a través de internet, la vulnerabilidad de los sistemas de información se ha convertido en una cuestión prioritaria para la seguridad (nacional y colectiva) de muchos Estados así como para la OTAN. Las conductas potenciales que pueden ser objeto de las operaciones a través de la red informática (Computer Network Operations – CNO), como por ejemplo acciones militares tanto ofensivas como defensivas llevadas a cabo a través de internet o de otras redes de información, presentan aspectos interesantes desde el punto de vista jurídico. El presente artículo examina en primer lugar la naturaleza de las CNO y analiza las dificultades que existen para identificar el sistema en el que tiene su origen un ataque y la posterior atribución de una conducta delictiva llevada a cabo en el espacio cibernético (o a través de este último) a un sujeto determinado. Tras la exposición de algunos criterios que permiten calificar las CNO como “uso de fuerza armada” (en el sentido del *ius in bello*), el artículo demuestra que el Derecho de los Conflictos Armados resulta de aplicación a las CNO, incluidos los principios y preceptos ultra-centenarios relativos a la neutralidad. Al mismo tiempo, pone de manifiesto cómo ese Derecho ofrece un nivel de protección humanitaria comparable con el que es de aplicación en el campo del uso de armas convencionales."
