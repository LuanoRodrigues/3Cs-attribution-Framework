INTRODUCTION\n\nIn early August 2008, a full-scale war broke out between Russia and Georgia over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a pro-Russian autonomous region of Georgia.¹ Bombs were dropped throughout the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, with Russian bombers targeting Georgia’s economic infrastructure, including the country’s largest Black Sea port, Poti, and the main road connecting the southern part of Georgia with the East.² In the two months leading up to this conflict, Georgia’s Internet infrastructure was also attacked and major Georgian website servers were brought down, hindering communication and causing confusion throughout the country.³ The kind of attacks used is known as distributed denial of service attacks.⁴ They are triggered\n\n* Senior Production Editor, Loyola of Los Angeles International &amp; Comparative Law Review (ILR), Volume 32; J.D., Loyola Law School, 2010; B.A., University of Southern California, 2007.

Combat no longer consists solely of physical attacks or invasions among nations with distinct military units. This new kind of warfare uses a target nation's own technology against it, in order to bring down vital infrastructure.¹⁰ As Internet and computer technology continues to develop, so too will the methods and means of warfare. Moreover, given the low cost and wide availability of computers, as well as the ability to operate them anonymously, cyber attacks make for an attractive method of warfare.¹¹ In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks, both by nations and by non-state actors.¹²\n\n5.

As described in a recent news article, a survey of the seventy largest Internet operators in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia found that malicious computer attacks were rising sharply and growing more sophisticated.¹³ Additionally, these attacks are being used not only in political conflict, but also in blackmail schemes and for the purpose of malicious mischief.¹⁴ While concerted online attacks have been a threat for years, the Russian-Georgian cyber conflict of 2008 illustrates how states are more forcefully engaging in cyber attacks as a way to weaken opponents' critical infrastructures—systems and assets vital to national security, economic security, and public health and safety.¹⁵\n\nCurrently, there is no provision in international humanitarian law (IHL)¹⁶ or customary international law (CIL)¹⁷ that explicitly outlaws cyber warfare or computer network attacks, either carried out independently or during times of war. This is understandable since the law of war dates back to the nineteenth century and has not yet been updated for applicability in the Information Age.¹⁸ Nonetheless, some legal restraints do apply.\n\nThis article argues that existing IHL principles should be used to analyze the legality of cyber attacks. Part II of this article discusses the increasing use of cyber warfare in international conflict. Part III of this article explains that IHL principles apply whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a state, are more than simply sporadic in nature and are intended to cause, or will foreseeably cause, injury, death, damage, or destruction. On the other hand, IHL most likely does not apply in the absence of those\n\n13.

Given the complexities and novelties involved in this new kind of warfare, however, Part V further proposes that the international community and powerful states should seek to supplement existing IHL principles with more explicit and transparent policies that best correspond to modern Internet technology and address the ways in which this technology can legally be used to carry out cyber attacks.\n\nIn sum, this article addresses the use of cyber or computer network attacks and considers how jus in bello, or the body of law concerned with what is permissible during hostilities, governs such conflict.¹⁹ This article ultimately seeks to answer the question: “Does a cyber attack constitute an act of war such that international humanitarian law principles apply and govern its use?”\n\n## II. RECENT CYBER ATTACKS ILLUSTRATE HOW STATES ARE MORE FORCEFULLY ENGAGING IN CYBER WARFARE AS A MEANS TO WEAKEN OPPONENTS’ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES\n\nThe Internet has emerged as a powerful tool for government functions, information, and mobilization, as well as commerce and social networking.²⁰ It has even become a way to disseminate ideological and political messages.²¹ With the increase in utilization of the Internet for more than just economic and social functions, the international community must be aware that it can also serve as a tool for conducting operations that lead to confusion, destruction, and even death. Examples of cyber attacks against nations in recent history underscore the potential implications in using the Internet as a weapon in war, as well as how there is now clear international recognition of cyberspace as a battlefield. This is evidenced by the fact that information warfare systems are currently being developed and used by at least 120 countries, including Peru, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Croatia, Vietnam, and Russia.²² In order to fully understand cyber attacks and their\n\n19.

What is Cyber Warfare?\n\nThe U.S. Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”²³ Such harm could be inflicted on the computer network, as well as to physical facilities and persons. Cyber attacks are distinct from cyber crimes, which are governed by national criminal statutes and include such acts as identity theft and Internet fraud.²⁴ Cyber attacks, unlike cyber crimes, involve “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”²⁵\n\nIn order to fully comprehend what is meant by cyber warfare, the concept of “cyberspace” should also be explored. Essentially, cyberspace is the sum of electronic networks including, but not limited to, the Internet, where various information operations occur.²⁶\n\nInformation warfare, on the other hand, is narrower than information operations and is defined as “information operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict to achieve or promote\n\nChristensen, *Bracing for Guerrilla Warfare in Cyberspace: ‘There are Lots of Opportunities; That’s Very Scary’*, CNN.COM, Apr. 6, 1999, http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/cyberterror/).\n\n23.

Recent Cyber Attacks and the Resulting Damage\n\nCyber attacks that have taken place in the past few years illustrate how states are utilizing modern technology and more forcefully engaging in information warfare to weaken opponents’ critical infrastructures. There is significant international concern that hostile foreign governments could preemptively launch computer-based attacks on integral national or regional systems, such as those supporting energy distribution, telecommunications,\n\n27.

INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW SHOULD GOVERN THE LEGALITY OF CYBER ATTACKS WHEN SUCH ATTACKS CONSTITUTE ARMED CONFLICT\n\nInformation gathering and disruption have always been major tools of war. Disrupting an enemy's communications networks may even have greater strategic value than destroying its arsenals or supply lines. Indeed, some information warfare methods are considered so unsavory as to be prohibited by the laws of war.\n\nWhile a cyber attack is not truly kinetic or physical in nature like traditional forms of weaponry, a cyber attack may still lead to major physical destruction and even death.55 Therefore, because of these possible consequences, a cyber attack could constitute an armed conflict, such that IHL governs, if certain criteria are met. The threshold question is under what circumstances can a cyber attack be deemed an armed conflict, such that IHL applies. This is an important question because its answer provides guidance to nations on how they can respond to such attacks in a way that is consistent with international legal norms.\n\n## A. International Humanitarian Law Background\n\nIHL is the branch of public international law that \"seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering which it causes.\"56 It is one of two principle divisions of the laws of war and is termed jus in bello, or the \"law in war.\"57 The other division is known as jus ad bellum, or the \"law to war,\" which governs the legality of resorting to armed force.58 The terms \"law of war\" and \"law of armed conflict\" are synonymous.\n\nJus in bello traditionally involves both Geneva and Hague law. Geneva law rests on the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols.59 These treaties are particularly concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict, with Additional Protocol I focusing on the means and methods of warfare. Conversely, Hague law refers to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, and is mainly concerned with methods and means of warfare, tactics, and the general conduct of hostilities. In modern\n\n55.

The Applicability of IHL to Cyber Attacks\n\nThe law of armed conflict, as a part of international law, is binding on states, yet a violation may also involve the prosecution of individuals for war crimes.⁶¹ Some have argued that IHL cannot govern cyber attacks because there is nothing physical or kinetic about such operations.⁶² In other words, a CNA is not an armed conflict in the true sense of the phrase and, therefore, such an attack falls outside of the scope of IHL. Article 2, which is common to all four of the Geneva Conventions, provides that “[i]n addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”⁶³ Additional Protocol I also relies on this same “armed conflict” language. Article 1(3) of Additional Protocol I states that “[t]his Protocol, which supplements the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims, shall apply in the situations referred to in Article 2 common to those Conventions.”⁶⁴ Thus, in order for IHL to govern a cyber attack, such an attack must in fact constitute an armed conflict.\n\nNevertheless, commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their subsequent Additional Protocols have posited that “armed conflict” can be viewed in a fairly expansive way.⁶⁵ Armed conflict has been defined as “any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces.”⁶⁶ A\n\n⁶⁰. *Id.*\n\n⁶¹.

For example, the replacement of border police with soldiers or an accidental border incursion by members of the armed forces would not amount to an armed conflict.67 Thus, some degree of intensity and duration must be considered, as underlying principles of IHL make clear.68 IHL is founded upon the idea that victims of armed conflict, including personnel who have been rendered hors de combat,69 are entitled to protection.70 This protection is “usually framed in terms of injury, death, or in the case of property, damage or destruction.”71 Therefore, fundamental principles of IHL provide that armed conflict occurs when a group takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy,72 thereby narrowing the definition of armed conflict and limiting its applicability.\n\nFrom the above discussion, it logically follows that a cyber attack may constitute armed conflict, even though the use of a computer as a weapon is not a traditional or physical method of warfare, as long as certain consequences arise. While cyber attacks employ modern technology not conceived of during the drafting of the Geneva Conventions, the language of Additional Protocol I, and in particular Article 36, indicate that the drafters anticipated the application of the rules to new developments in warfare methods.73 The law of armed conflict must change and develop to account for new humanitarian imperatives that may be generated\n\n67.

For example, the “Martens Clause” found in the Preamble to the Hague Convention IV of 1907 “asserts that even in cases not explicitly covered by specific agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of principles of international law derived from established custom, principles of humanity, and from the dictates of public conscience.”75 In other words, attacks should essentially be judged largely by their effects, rather than by how they are employed.76\n\nAdditional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides important guidance in assessing the applicability of IHL to cyber attacks. Additional Protocol I codifies many existing principles of CIL and introduces important new treaty provisions relating to international armed conflict.77 Some provisions of Additional Protocol I are controversial such that they are said to only bind state parties to the treaty and, thus, they do not reflect customary law.78 Nevertheless, the significance of Additional Protocol I, as it relates to cyber warfare specifically and jus in bello generally, is that it supplements the original Geneva Conventions as they apply to civilians in an armed conflict as well as to the prohibited methods of warfare in situations of conflict.79\n\nA key aspect of Additional Protocol I is the “doctrine of unnecessary suffering,” which is fundamental to jus in bello in general.80 Article 35 states: “In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.”81 This principle serves to place some limits on the barbarity and the range of means and weapons\n\n74.

Furthermore, Additional Protocol I was the first treaty to set out specifically the principle of proportionality, which requires that the losses resulting from military action should not be excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.⁸² Proportionality closely relates to the concept of indiscriminate attacks. Article 51(5)(b) describes an indiscriminate attack as one that \"may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\"⁸³ These principles are important to cyber warfare because they require that the attacker refrain from attacks that may be expected to cause excessive collateral damage.⁸⁴\n\nSimilar to nuclear weapons, cyber weapons are arguably sui generis or, in other words, they are unique in their characteristics and therefore should be governed by a unique set of laws.⁸⁵ Nevertheless, cyber weapons, just like nuclear weapons, are weapons that result in consequences similar to that of traditional weapons. Accordingly, IHL principles, such as the concept of unnecessary suffering and proportionality, still have relevance in the case of a cyber attack. Often, the question simply will be: To what extent do these principles apply? While some uncertainties remain, what is clear from this discussion is that an \"armed conflict\" occurs when an actor takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy, regardless of the weapon used.⁸⁶\n\nScholars agree that an armed conflict exists and IHL governs once kinetic weapons are used in combination with CNAs.⁸⁷ The question becomes more difficult when computer networks conduct the first or only hostile acts. The key in assessing such conduct, however, is the effects or consequences of the attacks. Based on this framework, IHL applies whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a\n\n⁸².

On the other hand, IHL would probably not pertain where the actual, foreseeable, or intended consequences do not include injury, death, damage, or destruction.\n\nThe reason why a consequence-based approach is necessary in analyzing the application of IHL to cyber attacks is because once armed conflict has commenced, the means by which injury, death, damage, or destruction are produced has no bearing on the legality of that conduct.⁹⁰ Thus, a lone cyber attack is subject to IHL if these particular consequences result.\n\nArticle 48 of Additional Protocol I mandates that parties to a conflict direct their operations against military objectives.⁹¹ Thus, targeting a military object, such as military air traffic control system, would be permissible. Since it is often the case that a CNA would target not purely military objectives, the next question is whether targeting civilian computer networks or systems are permissible. Based on the language of Article 48, however, the prohibition is not so much on targeting non-military objectives as it is on attacking them through acts of violence.⁹² Consequently, IHL would prohibit cyber attacks directed against non-military objectives that are intended to, or would foreseeably, cause injury, death, destruction, or damage.⁹³ On the other hand, an attack targeting a non-military objective that is not likely to result in the aforementioned consequences would be permissible.⁹⁴\n\n---\n\n⁸⁸.

THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN CYBER CONFLICT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITIES IN APPLYING IHL TO CYBER ATTACKS\n\nSince IHL may apply to cyber warfare in certain situations depending on the results of an attack, it is not necessary to create a completely new set of laws or form a new treaty to apply solely to cyber attacks. Nevertheless, applying IHL to the 2008 cyber conflict involving Russia and Georgia illustrates the difficulties in being able to implement fully IHL in these instances and to articulate concretely the reactions to such attacks. The most notable difficulties involve attributing responsibility for the attacks and determining the difference between military objectives and non-military objectives in the context of targeted websites and computer systems.\n\n### A. Was Russia Responsible for the Attacks on Georgian Websites?\n\nBoth Russia and Georgia are state parties to Additional Protocol I, which pertains to the protection of victims of international armed conflict.⁹⁵ Thus, as parties to the treaty, its provisions bind them, including the duty before carrying out an attack to “do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are . . . military objectives.”⁹⁶ Even for states not a party to the Protocol, customary law would still require their forces to attack only military objectives, meaning that these targets must be distinguished from civilian objectives.⁹⁷ The Institute of International Law even points out that existing international law prohibits the use of all weapons that, by their nature, affect indiscriminately both military and non-military objectives.⁹⁸\n\nAdditional Protocol I further requires that in the time of armed conflict, states must ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to counsel military commanders regarding the application of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol\n\n---\n\n⁹⁵.

Nevertheless, given the relatively small amount of equipment required to launch a cyber attack and the pervasiveness of the Internet, ascertaining whether Russia, as opposed to non-state actors, was responsible for the attacks on Georgian websites, such that legal implications are created, is extremely difficult. Conversely, actually engaging in cyber war or bombarding a website is relatively simple. As demonstrated by one reporter, all one needs to do is save a copy of a certain Georgian web page to one’s hard drive and then open it on the computer’s browser. Once accessed, the page will load thumb-nailed versions of a dozen key Georgian websites in a single window. All the cyber “soldier” must do is set the page to update automatically every three to five seconds and from then on the browser will continue to send thousands of queries to the most important Georgian websites, helping to overload them and bring them down.⁹⁹ This is the simple way of bringing down a website, but there are more sophisticated and creative options, including obtaining certain kinds of software to carry out DDoS attacks.¹⁰¹\n\nThe evidence is currently not clear whether Russia was involved in the shutdown of Georgian websites or whether the attacks can be attributed to non-state actors.¹⁰² Jose Nazario, an Internet security specialist, believes that non-state actors likely caused the attacks on Georgian websites, because there is a history of the kind of botnet attacks involved previously attacking commercial or non-political targets.¹⁰³ Cyber attacks are often difficult to trace and it can take several months to reach definitive answers.

There has been consistent support from members of the Russian government and essentially an implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hackers’ attacks.¹¹¹ If indeed the Russian government or persons acting on behalf of the Russian government were responsible for the attacks on Georgian sites, then the only question as to the applicability of IHL would be whether such attacks resulted in death, damage, destruction, or injury.\n\nBesides the possibility of ordinary Russian citizens being responsible for the attacks, analysts have also accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a network of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and government, of the Georgian attacks.¹¹² Visits to Georgian government websites seemingly were re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey where the traffic was blocked. According to experts, these servers are widely known to be under the control of the RBN and influenced by the Russian government.¹¹³ If the RBN were acting on behalf of the Russian government, then this would constitute conduct by a state.¹¹⁴\n\nIf the actors were civilians, the problem in applying IHL becomes more complex.

They could be attacked in retaliation like any other military personnel and could be able to achieve prisoner of war status. Again, the situation becomes more problematic when the technicians that act for the nation or military are not incorporated into the armed forces, but rather are simply computer-savvy civilians.¹¹⁸\n\n## B. Defining Military Objectives\n\nAs mentioned above, in the context of military operations, only military objectives may be directly attacked. The definition of military objectives as provided in Additional Protocol I may be considered a part of CIL. Under Article 52(2) of the Protocol, \"military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\"¹¹⁹ Military equipment and their facilities, other than medical and religious structures, are clearly military objectives and, therefore, subject to direct cyber attacks.¹²⁰\n\nThe problem arises, however, when dual-use objects, objects that serve both military and civilian purposes such as airports and bridges, are targeted. The source of the dilemma in clearly defining military objectives versus non-military objectives is in interpreting the terms found in Article 52 of Additional Protocol I.¹²¹ Commentaries to the Protocol seem to define military objectives more narrowly, stating that they are objects \"directly used by the armed forces,\" locations \"of special importance for military operations,\" and objects intended for use or being used\n\n---\n\n¹¹⁷.

Chances are that if the attack results in none of the aforementioned consequences, the fact that a civilian object was targeted will probably be of little concern. This again underscores why the results of a cyber attack are central to the legal analysis.\n\n## C. The Attacks on Georgian Websites Likely Do Not Amount to an Instance of Armed Conflict, Such That IHL Governs\n\nAssuming that Russia was responsible for the cyber attacks on Georgia, the next question must be whether IHL governs this conflict. While the cyber attacks on Georgia appeared to eventually be part of a classic conflict in which the Russian military later invaded Georgia, the cyber conflict itself did not result in the kinds of consequences necessary to rise to the level of an armed conflict. As previously mentioned, during the cyber conflict, major Georgian servers were brought down, resulting in confusion throughout the country and hindering communication.¹²⁴ An argument could be made, perhaps, that damage or destruction was done to Georgian property, even if death or injury did not occur. Nevertheless, because it appears that the main results of the Georgian attacks were confusion and inconvenience, the attacks were thus permissible, regardless of whether the targets were deemed military or non-military objectives.¹²⁵\n\nEven so, cyber attacks that result in confusion, miscommunication, or the temporary shutdown of networks are serious problems, and can be harmful to countries that rely heavily on the Internet. Furthermore, it is entirely possible for the shutdown of a nation’s major websites to lead to far greater consequences.\n\nBecause investigators in one country do not ordinarily have the authority to cross international borders, the investigation into\n\n122. *Id.* at 380.\n\n123. *Id.* at 380-81.\n\n124.

Law enforcement or national security personnel cannot unilaterally pursue investigations into networks located in other countries.¹²⁶ Just as it is difficult to determine who conducted a cyber attack, it is equally difficult to determine what a permissible retaliatory response to this kind of attack is, especially when the attack inflicts minimal damage. In the absence of death or widespread destruction, whether the international community would consider a conventional military attack a proportionate response is questionable.¹²⁷ For example, although the United States recognizes that initial patterns of attack or infiltration can rise to the level of an armed attack, it takes the position that reprisals involving armed conflict or the use of force are illegal. The United States thus justifies a responsive use of force in the exercise of the right of self-defense.¹²⁸ Some also argue that cyber attacks require an expansion of the definition of the use of force, such that there would be greater permissible responses through self-defense.¹²⁹ But expanding the definition in order to create greater conflict is not necessary and does not serve any legitimate purpose, particularly when the initial attack does not result in widespread destruction or loss of life. Moreover, legal developments in this area should move in the direction of narrowing the permissible causes for armed conflict, not enlarging them.\n\nThe 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict provides a good example of how the many uncertainties and novelties of cyber warfare make the application of IHL difficult in certain instances. It is especially hard when determining responsibility for attacks or clearly defining the distinction between military and non-military objectives. An analysis of the Georgian attacks is meant to highlight the types of issues that arise when applying IHL to such conduct. This does not mean that IHL is not the proper regime to\n\n126. BRYAN W.

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND POWERFUL STATES MUST SET FORTH MORE EXPLICIT AND TRANSPARENT POLICIES REGARDING CYBER WARFARE ISSUES IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING IHL PRINCIPLES\n\nExisting principles governing the law of war need not be abandoned in the era of modern warfare. Rather, existing rules and mechanisms simply need to be applied in novel ways and old tenets of warfare must be rethought. The challenges, as well as the opportunities, of cyber warfare need to be better understood, and its laws and procedures need to be updated to accommodate the changes in global technology. Over the past few years, some states and international organizations have devoted considerable effort to devise and implement preventative measures aimed at ensuring better compliance with IHL in the event of a cyber attack.¹³¹ Expert seminars have been assembled to discuss various ideas and proposals, particularly through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).¹³² Many participants have acknowledged a positive obligation on states not involved in an armed conflict to take action against states that are violating IHL, particularly by using their influences to stop the violations.¹³³\n\nSome argue that a new international accord or treaty must be created in order to deal specifically with cyber warfare.¹³⁴ The rationale is that the Internet takes advantage of legal loopholes where state and non-state actors can ignore traditional Western notions of war as described by IHL and, therefore, more international laws are needed to apply directly to cyberspace.¹³⁵\n\n---\n\n¹³⁰. *Contra*.

Even if there were stiffer repercussions, a country might still decide that these consequences would not outweigh its need to conduct operations against a particular adversary.¹⁴³ Because of the importance of satellites for international telecommunications, as well as for military command, control, and intelligence, some forms of cyber warfare may involve orbital assets and, thus, implicate the ITU and other telecommunication regulators.¹⁴⁴ Despite these concerns, the work of the ITU could still prove to be valuable in increasing international dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues, particularly through the ITU’s Global Cybersecurity Agenda, which works on coordinating responses to cyber attacks.¹⁴⁵\n\nThe European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was created in 2004 as a response to concerns about cyber security throughout the European Union.¹⁴⁶ Most of the efforts by the European Commission have resulted in creating technical standards specifically with regard to Internet governance, as opposed to supplementing international law norms. ENISA has, however, recognized the complexity of the technological environment and the threat posed by cyber attacks against electronic communications networks on the availability and integrity of the information accessed through these networks, creating a high-risk situation.¹⁴⁷ Similarly, an Asian regional forum, the Telecommunications and Information Working Group of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, has also promoted regional cooperation in fighting cyber attacks and terrorist misuse of cyber\n\n142.

The Malaysian government supported the establishment of the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism, or IMPACT, in May 2008.¹⁴⁹ IMPACT is focused mostly on the “‘upper end of cyber threats’” or attacks that would damage a nation’s critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control.¹⁵⁰ It is clear that individual nations or governments cannot address cyber warfare issues alone; international cooperation is required.¹⁵¹ The aforementioned organizations recognize the difficulties in applying IHL principles to cyber attacks, but are working to establish clearer policies on which nations can rely.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a major concern is the ability to attribute a cyber attack to a particular government entity because, although an IP address can be tracked, it does not necessarily mean that a military or government official is behind the keyboard. In the near future, however, Internet anonymity may be lessened, thus making it easier to trace the source of cyber attacks.¹⁵² The UN National Security Agency has been participating in the “IP Traceback” drafting group since the fall of 2008. But this proposal has raised concerns among a number of international organizations. While the upshot of this may be that governments will be able to more effectively track cyber attacks to the source, it is also likely that this type of capability could be misused.¹⁵³ Some people believe that traceback mechanisms will no longer serve much of a purpose because there are too many sources in a DDoS attack to be useful, and the source computer was, in many cases, hacked in the first place.¹⁵⁴\n\nWhile the UN has no power to impose Internet standards on the world,¹⁵⁵ it has been lobbying for more influence over the way\n\n148.

States Should Develop Clearly Defined Cyber Strategies and Comprehensive Government-Network Defenses\n\nThe conduct and practices of states are itself a major source of CIL and would assist in supplementing conventional norms regarding the law of war and its application to cyber warfare. Particularly, China and the United States serve as examples of states working to establish strong national policies on cyber attacks.\n\nThe Chinese military and nationally supported groups have prepared detailed plans regarding cyber attacks as a way to achieve electronic dominance.¹⁵⁷ China’s ambitions extend to crippling an enemy’s financial, military, and communications capabilities early in conflict, and there is evidence to indicate that China regards offensive computer operations as essential to taking control in the first stages of war.¹⁵⁸ Furthermore, China has developed viruses to attack enemy computers and has even recently hacked into the White House computer network.¹⁵⁹ While these plans may raise numerous concerns for other nations, China’s push to make cyber warfare an integral part of their national army is prudent. The sooner states embrace the concept of cyber warfare, the sooner IHL ambiguities can be resolved.\n\nEngineering standards are set by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), both of which are voluntary industry organizations.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\n\nBecause cyber attacks are not going to disappear, it is better that states establish clear national policies, such that the rest of the international community can follow suit.\n\nThe United States has become increasingly concerned about the threats of cyber attacks. In recent years, there have been a series of cyber attacks on military and homeland security computer networks in the United States, many of which have been traced back to China.¹⁶⁰ Presumably as a way to deal with these dangers, the United States has developed cyber warfare contingency plans under the National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 16, which was implemented in 2002.¹⁶¹ The directive, however, has remained classified and, therefore, does little to deter potential enemies. Nevertheless, this directive apparently ordered the development of guidelines to regulate the use of cyber weapons in war. Additionally, NSPD 16 instituted strict rules of engagement requiring “top-level” approval for any such attack.¹⁶² Some people in the United States believe that the nation needs to do more to develop an offensive cyber war capability, similar to that of China.¹⁶³ In all reality, nations will probably not be able to develop a complete military offensive until there is further clarity in determining the attribution of attacks. Furthermore, the lines separating crime, terrorism, and warfare are often hard to draw.¹⁶⁴ Nevertheless, the United States is taking action by attempting to develop and sustain a cyber-force with personnel trained in conducting cyber warfare.¹⁶⁵ More nations should seek to develop transparent standards regarding cyber attacks so that the law can continue to develop and nations can better understand how respond to such attacks.\n\n160.

The Future of Cyber Warfare: The Cyber Defense Era\n\nThe near future of cyber warfare will likely resemble that of nuclear defense, in which the growing trend will be for nations to set up cyber defense systems as a way to deter cyber attacks by other nations. Recently, seven NATO countries backed the establishment of a new cyber warfare defense center in Estonia.¹⁶⁶ The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) began operations in the Fall of 2008, and conducts research and training in cyber warfare.¹⁶⁷ A large portion of the CCDCOE’s staff are specialists from the sponsoring countries, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Spain, and the United States has agreed to send an observer.¹⁶⁸ In June 2009, the CCDCOE held a Conference on Cyber Warfare to discuss definitions of cyber warfare and the enhancement of cyber defense capabilities.¹⁶⁹\n\nIn the near future, there will likely be greater adoption of counter-strategies by states in order to deflect radicalization that is used for inciting violence or attacking enemy infrastructures over the Internet. These strategies might include open-source intelligence gathering and infiltration efforts.¹⁷⁰ In addition, nations may also seek to take advantage of opportunities to use offensive information operations to achieve specific outcomes, including operations to undermine group cohesion and to interfere with decision-making, or to constrain terrorist activities in order to preempt attacks.¹⁷¹ The reason for this is that reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful cyber attacks.¹⁷² Thus, more effective defense measures should incorporate predictive, active, and preemptive elements.¹⁷³\n\nThe United States, through the Department of Defense (DOD), has also created a program known as Computer Network\n\n---\n\n¹⁶⁶.

Additionally, more nations will likely follow the United States’ lead by creating these kinds of defense mechanisms in the near future.\n\n## VI. CONCLUSION\n\nCyberspace has been in existence for a number of years, but government entities are increasingly taking advantage of this domain as a way to carry out various kinds of war-like attacks with the help of computers. This raises many concerns, given that major aspects of a nation’s critical or physical infrastructure are connected to cyberspace.¹⁷⁷\n\nThis article has shown that international laws that are currently in place do address the ever-changing nature of warfare. The Geneva Conventions, as well as the IHL principles of proportionality and unnecessary suffering, all provide a framework for addressing cyber warfare issues. The international legal community, however, must continue to work to address certain ambiguities that exist in applying IHL so that nations have a clear understanding as to how to go about carrying out or defending against a cyber attack. The key for states and international organizations in the upcoming years is to find better, more efficient ways to determine who is responsible for particular cyber attacks and to establish more transparent national policies regarding evolving cyber warfare issues. Although cyber attacks are usually not immediately directed at human beings, they do have the potential to indirectly cause severe injuries or even\n\n174. *Id.* at 2.\n175. *Id.* at 4.\n176. *Id.* at 12.\n177. *Solce, supra note 22, at 302.*",

Some advocate that a nation’s military should actually create a “Cyber Force” that focuses entirely on cyber attacks.¹⁸¹ Others argue that cyber attacks only produce a limited breadth of damage and, therefore, are not a major threat such that there should be international legal concerns.¹⁸² Nevertheless, the unpredictable consequences and unexpected adversarial advantages that stem from a cyber attack can be just as destructive and damaging as a physical attack. Accordingly, states and international organizations must take proactive stances toward establishing national cyber security strategies and adhering to international legal norms, with the recognition that cyber warfare is here to stay.\n\n---\n\n¹⁷⁸.

INTRODUCTION\nIn early August 2008, a full-scale war broke out between Russia and Georgia over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a pro-Russian autonomous region of Georgia.¹ Bombs were dropped throughout the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, with Russian bombers targeting Georgia’s economic infrastructure, including the country’s largest Black Sea port, Poti, and the main road connecting the southern part of Georgia with the East.² In the two months leading up to this conflict, Georgia’s Internet infrastructure was also attacked and major Georgian website servers were brought down, hindering communication and causing confusion throughout the country.³ The kind of attacks used is known as distributed denial of service attacks.⁴ They are triggered\n* Senior Production Editor, Loyola of Los Angeles International &amp; Comparative Law Review (ILR), Volume 32; J.D., Loyola Law School, 2010; B.A., University of Southern California, 2007.

Combat no longer consists solely of physical attacks or invasions among nations with distinct military units. This new kind of warfare uses a target nation's own technology against it, in order to bring down vital infrastructure.¹⁰ As Internet and computer technology continues to develop, so too will the methods and means of warfare. Moreover, given the low cost and wide availability of computers, as well as the ability to operate them anonymously, cyber attacks make for an attractive method of warfare.¹¹ In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks, both by nations and by non-state actors.¹²\n5.

As described in a recent news article, a survey of the seventy largest Internet operators in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia found that malicious computer attacks were rising sharply and growing more sophisticated.¹³ Additionally, these attacks are being used not only in political conflict, but also in blackmail schemes and for the purpose of malicious mischief.¹⁴ While concerted online attacks have been a threat for years, the Russian-Georgian cyber conflict of 2008 illustrates how states are more forcefully engaging in cyber attacks as a way to weaken opponents' critical infrastructures—systems and assets vital to national security, economic security, and public health and safety.¹⁵\nCurrently, there is no provision in international humanitarian law (IHL)¹⁶ or customary international law (CIL)¹⁷ that explicitly outlaws cyber warfare or computer network attacks, either carried out independently or during times of war. This is understandable since the law of war dates back to the nineteenth century and has not yet been updated for applicability in the Information Age.¹⁸ Nonetheless, some legal restraints do apply.\nThis article argues that existing IHL principles should be used to analyze the legality of cyber attacks. Part II of this article discusses the increasing use of cyber warfare in international conflict. Part III of this article explains that IHL principles apply whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a state, are more than simply sporadic in nature and are intended to cause, or will foreseeably cause, injury, death, damage, or destruction. On the other hand, IHL most likely does not apply in the absence of those\n13.

Given the complexities and novelties involved in this new kind of warfare, however, Part V further proposes that the international community and powerful states should seek to supplement existing IHL principles with more explicit and transparent policies that best correspond to modern Internet technology and address the ways in which this technology can legally be used to carry out cyber attacks.\nIn sum, this article addresses the use of cyber or computer network attacks and considers how jus in bello, or the body of law concerned with what is permissible during hostilities, governs such conflict.¹⁹ This article ultimately seeks to answer the question: “Does a cyber attack constitute an act of war such that international humanitarian law principles apply and govern its use?”\n## II. RECENT CYBER ATTACKS ILLUSTRATE HOW STATES ARE MORE FORCEFULLY ENGAGING IN CYBER WARFARE AS A MEANS TO WEAKEN OPPONENTS’ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES\nThe Internet has emerged as a powerful tool for government functions, information, and mobilization, as well as commerce and social networking.²⁰ It has even become a way to disseminate ideological and political messages.²¹ With the increase in utilization of the Internet for more than just economic and social functions, the international community must be aware that it can also serve as a tool for conducting operations that lead to confusion, destruction, and even death. Examples of cyber attacks against nations in recent history underscore the potential implications in using the Internet as a weapon in war, as well as how there is now clear international recognition of cyberspace as a battlefield. This is evidenced by the fact that information warfare systems are currently being developed and used by at least 120 countries, including Peru, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Croatia, Vietnam, and Russia.²² In order to fully understand cyber attacks and their\n19.

What is Cyber Warfare?\nThe U.S. Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”²³ Such harm could be inflicted on the computer network, as well as to physical facilities and persons. Cyber attacks are distinct from cyber crimes, which are governed by national criminal statutes and include such acts as identity theft and Internet fraud.²⁴ Cyber attacks, unlike cyber crimes, involve “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”²⁵\nIn order to fully comprehend what is meant by cyber warfare, the concept of “cyberspace” should also be explored. Essentially, cyberspace is the sum of electronic networks including, but not limited to, the Internet, where various information operations occur.²⁶\nInformation warfare, on the other hand, is narrower than information operations and is defined as “information operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict to achieve or promote\nChristensen, *Bracing for Guerrilla Warfare in Cyberspace: ‘There are Lots of Opportunities; That’s Very Scary’*, CNN.COM, Apr. 6, 1999, http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/cyberterror/).\n23.

Recent Cyber Attacks and the Resulting Damage\nCyber attacks that have taken place in the past few years illustrate how states are utilizing modern technology and more forcefully engaging in information warfare to weaken opponents’ critical infrastructures. There is significant international concern that hostile foreign governments could preemptively launch computer-based attacks on integral national or regional systems, such as those supporting energy distribution, telecommunications,\n27.

Individuals or nations that use cyber weapons may choose from a variety of options, including syntactic, semantic, and mixed weapons.⁴³ Syntactic weapons, which target a computer's operating system, include malicious code, such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, DDoS, and spyware.⁴⁴ Through DDoS attacks, like those used against Georgia, the cyber attacker shuts down a website by bombarding it with large amounts of traffic.⁴⁵ Conversely, semantic weapons target \"the accuracy of information to which the computer user has access.\"⁴⁶ In other words, a semantic attack consists of altering information that enters the computer's system\n38.

Bots are remote-controlled computer programs that infect other computers. A hacker who controls the bots can spy, copy, and transmit sensitive data, as well as organize the bots in a swarm attack against targeted computers.⁴⁹\nAttacked computers or networks are systems that have been infected with malicious software through the use of these weapons, and that are then brought under the control of an attacker in a remote location.⁵⁰ Infected devices continually listen for commands from the attacker and act upon them, with the intention of compromising the opponent’s security or critical infrastructure.⁵¹\nThe Internet was originally a network of computers linked to the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s and 1970s.⁵² As the computer networks of universities and private research facilities merged through the development of hypertext, a global network with benefits to both military and civilian sectors was created.⁵³ The new technology, however, has also created vulnerabilities for nations that rely heavily on the Internet, especially in their military and governmental infrastructures.⁵⁴ This has created an opportunity for warring parties to exploit network vulnerabilities with various cyber weapons and attacks.\n---\n47.

INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW SHOULD GOVERN THE LEGALITY OF CYBER ATTACKS WHEN SUCH ATTACKS CONSTITUTE ARMED CONFLICT\nInformation gathering and disruption have always been major tools of war. Disrupting an enemy's communications networks may even have greater strategic value than destroying its arsenals or supply lines. Indeed, some information warfare methods are considered so unsavory as to be prohibited by the laws of war.\nWhile a cyber attack is not truly kinetic or physical in nature like traditional forms of weaponry, a cyber attack may still lead to major physical destruction and even death.55 Therefore, because of these possible consequences, a cyber attack could constitute an armed conflict, such that IHL governs, if certain criteria are met. The threshold question is under what circumstances can a cyber attack be deemed an armed conflict, such that IHL applies. This is an important question because its answer provides guidance to nations on how they can respond to such attacks in a way that is consistent with international legal norms.\n## A. International Humanitarian Law Background\nIHL is the branch of public international law that \"seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering which it causes.\"56 It is one of two principle divisions of the laws of war and is termed jus in bello, or the \"law in war.\"57 The other division is known as jus ad bellum, or the \"law to war,\" which governs the legality of resorting to armed force.58 The terms \"law of war\" and \"law of armed conflict\" are synonymous.\nJus in bello traditionally involves both Geneva and Hague law. Geneva law rests on the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols.59 These treaties are particularly concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict, with Additional Protocol I focusing on the means and methods of warfare. Conversely, Hague law refers to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, and is mainly concerned with methods and means of warfare, tactics, and the general conduct of hostilities. In modern\n55.

Id. at 2.\n2010]\nThe Era of Cyber Warfare\n313\nusage, IHL is taken to comprise jus in bello in both its Geneva and Hague dimensions.⁶⁰\n## B. The Applicability of IHL to Cyber Attacks\nThe law of armed conflict, as a part of international law, is binding on states, yet a violation may also involve the prosecution of individuals for war crimes.⁶¹ Some have argued that IHL cannot govern cyber attacks because there is nothing physical or kinetic about such operations.⁶² In other words, a CNA is not an armed conflict in the true sense of the phrase and, therefore, such an attack falls outside of the scope of IHL. Article 2, which is common to all four of the Geneva Conventions, provides that “[i]n addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”⁶³ Additional Protocol I also relies on this same “armed conflict” language. Article 1(3) of Additional Protocol I states that “[t]his Protocol, which supplements the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims, shall apply in the situations referred to in Article 2 common to those Conventions.”⁶⁴ Thus, in order for IHL to govern a cyber attack, such an attack must in fact constitute an armed conflict.\nNevertheless, commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their subsequent Additional Protocols have posited that “armed conflict” can be viewed in a fairly expansive way.⁶⁵ Armed conflict has been defined as “any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces.”⁶⁶ A\n⁶⁰. *Id.*\n⁶¹.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\ndispute resulting in the engagement of armed forces, however, cannot be the sole criterion. For example, the replacement of border police with soldiers or an accidental border incursion by members of the armed forces would not amount to an armed conflict.67 Thus, some degree of intensity and duration must be considered, as underlying principles of IHL make clear.68 IHL is founded upon the idea that victims of armed conflict, including personnel who have been rendered hors de combat,69 are entitled to protection.70 This protection is “usually framed in terms of injury, death, or in the case of property, damage or destruction.”71 Therefore, fundamental principles of IHL provide that armed conflict occurs when a group takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy,72 thereby narrowing the definition of armed conflict and limiting its applicability.\nFrom the above discussion, it logically follows that a cyber attack may constitute armed conflict, even though the use of a computer as a weapon is not a traditional or physical method of warfare, as long as certain consequences arise. While cyber attacks employ modern technology not conceived of during the drafting of the Geneva Conventions, the language of Additional Protocol I, and in particular Article 36, indicate that the drafters anticipated the application of the rules to new developments in warfare methods.73 The law of armed conflict must change and develop to account for new humanitarian imperatives that may be generated\n67. See id.\n68. See Wired Warfare, supra note 27, at 372.\n69. According to Additional Protocol I, art. 41(1) and (2), a person is hors de combat if “he is in the power of an adverse party; he clearly expresses an intention to surrender; or he has been rendered unconscious or is otherwise incapacitated by wounds or sickness, and therefore is incapable of defending himself . . .” Additional Protocol I, supra note 64, 1125 U.N.T.S. at 22.\n70.

Article 36 provides: “In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party.” Additional Protocol I, supra note 64, 1125 U.N.T.S. at 21.\n2010]\nThe Era of Cyber Warfare\n315\nby the evolution in the conduct of armed conflict itself.74 In fact, IHL anticipates technological change. For example, the “Martens Clause” found in the Preamble to the Hague Convention IV of 1907 “asserts that even in cases not explicitly covered by specific agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of principles of international law derived from established custom, principles of humanity, and from the dictates of public conscience.”75 In other words, attacks should essentially be judged largely by their effects, rather than by how they are employed.76\nAdditional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides important guidance in assessing the applicability of IHL to cyber attacks. Additional Protocol I codifies many existing principles of CIL and introduces important new treaty provisions relating to international armed conflict.77 Some provisions of Additional Protocol I are controversial such that they are said to only bind state parties to the treaty and, thus, they do not reflect customary law.78 Nevertheless, the significance of Additional Protocol I, as it relates to cyber warfare specifically and jus in bello generally, is that it supplements the original Geneva Conventions as they apply to civilians in an armed conflict as well as to the prohibited methods of warfare in situations of conflict.79\nA key aspect of Additional Protocol I is the “doctrine of unnecessary suffering,” which is fundamental to jus in bello in general.80 Article 35 states: “In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.”81 This principle serves to place some limits on the barbarity and the range of means and weapons\n74.

Furthermore, Additional Protocol I was the first treaty to set out specifically the principle of proportionality, which requires that the losses resulting from military action should not be excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.⁸² Proportionality closely relates to the concept of indiscriminate attacks. Article 51(5)(b) describes an indiscriminate attack as one that \"may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\"⁸³ These principles are important to cyber warfare because they require that the attacker refrain from attacks that may be expected to cause excessive collateral damage.⁸⁴\nSimilar to nuclear weapons, cyber weapons are arguably sui generis or, in other words, they are unique in their characteristics and therefore should be governed by a unique set of laws.⁸⁵ Nevertheless, cyber weapons, just like nuclear weapons, are weapons that result in consequences similar to that of traditional weapons. Accordingly, IHL principles, such as the concept of unnecessary suffering and proportionality, still have relevance in the case of a cyber attack. Often, the question simply will be: To what extent do these principles apply? While some uncertainties remain, what is clear from this discussion is that an \"armed conflict\" occurs when an actor takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy, regardless of the weapon used.⁸⁶\nScholars agree that an armed conflict exists and IHL governs once kinetic weapons are used in combination with CNAs.⁸⁷ The question becomes more difficult when computer networks conduct the first or only hostile acts. The key in assessing such conduct, however, is the effects or consequences of the attacks. Based on this framework, IHL applies whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a\n⁸².

On the other hand, IHL would probably not pertain where the actual, foreseeable, or intended consequences do not include injury, death, damage, or destruction.\nThe reason why a consequence-based approach is necessary in analyzing the application of IHL to cyber attacks is because once armed conflict has commenced, the means by which injury, death, damage, or destruction are produced has no bearing on the legality of that conduct.⁹⁰ Thus, a lone cyber attack is subject to IHL if these particular consequences result.\nArticle 48 of Additional Protocol I mandates that parties to a conflict direct their operations against military objectives.⁹¹ Thus, targeting a military object, such as military air traffic control system, would be permissible. Since it is often the case that a CNA would target not purely military objectives, the next question is whether targeting civilian computer networks or systems are permissible. Based on the language of Article 48, however, the prohibition is not so much on targeting non-military objectives as it is on attacking them through acts of violence.⁹² Consequently, IHL would prohibit cyber attacks directed against non-military objectives that are intended to, or would foreseeably, cause injury, death, destruction, or damage.⁹³ On the other hand, an attack targeting a non-military objective that is not likely to result in the aforementioned consequences would be permissible.⁹⁴\n---\n⁸⁸.

THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN CYBER CONFLICT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITIES IN APPLYING IHL TO CYBER ATTACKS\nSince IHL may apply to cyber warfare in certain situations depending on the results of an attack, it is not necessary to create a completely new set of laws or form a new treaty to apply solely to cyber attacks. Nevertheless, applying IHL to the 2008 cyber conflict involving Russia and Georgia illustrates the difficulties in being able to implement fully IHL in these instances and to articulate concretely the reactions to such attacks. The most notable difficulties involve attributing responsibility for the attacks and determining the difference between military objectives and non-military objectives in the context of targeted websites and computer systems.\n### A. Was Russia Responsible for the Attacks on Georgian Websites?\nBoth Russia and Georgia are state parties to Additional Protocol I, which pertains to the protection of victims of international armed conflict.⁹⁵ Thus, as parties to the treaty, its provisions bind them, including the duty before carrying out an attack to “do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are . . . military objectives.”⁹⁶ Even for states not a party to the Protocol, customary law would still require their forces to attack only military objectives, meaning that these targets must be distinguished from civilian objectives.⁹⁷ The Institute of International Law even points out that existing international law prohibits the use of all weapons that, by their nature, affect indiscriminately both military and non-military objectives.⁹⁸\nAdditional Protocol I further requires that in the time of armed conflict, states must ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to counsel military commanders regarding the application of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol\n---\n⁹⁵.

Nevertheless, given the relatively small amount of equipment required to launch a cyber attack and the pervasiveness of the Internet, ascertaining whether Russia, as opposed to non-state actors, was responsible for the attacks on Georgian websites, such that legal implications are created, is extremely difficult. Conversely, actually engaging in cyber war or bombarding a website is relatively simple. As demonstrated by one reporter, all one needs to do is save a copy of a certain Georgian web page to one’s hard drive and then open it on the computer’s browser. Once accessed, the page will load thumb-nailed versions of a dozen key Georgian websites in a single window. All the cyber “soldier” must do is set the page to update automatically every three to five seconds and from then on the browser will continue to send thousands of queries to the most important Georgian websites, helping to overload them and bring them down.⁹⁹ This is the simple way of bringing down a website, but there are more sophisticated and creative options, including obtaining certain kinds of software to carry out DDoS attacks.¹⁰¹\nThe evidence is currently not clear whether Russia was involved in the shutdown of Georgian websites or whether the attacks can be attributed to non-state actors.¹⁰² Jose Nazario, an Internet security specialist, believes that non-state actors likely caused the attacks on Georgian websites, because there is a history of the kind of botnet attacks involved previously attacking commercial or non-political targets.¹⁰³ Cyber attacks are often difficult to trace and it can take several months to reach definitive answers.

The real suspects ended up being two teenagers in Northern California.¹⁰⁴\nProject Grey Goose, an open-source initiative launched on August 22, 2008, has examined the Russian-Georgian cyber war and has drawn conclusions regarding the Russian government's involvement in the attacks.¹⁰⁵ The group based its conclusion on data collected from two Russian hacker forums, www.xakep.ru and www.stopgeorgian.ru, along with network log files detailing 29,000 status events indicating the up/down status of 149 Georgian websites.¹⁰⁶ In its Phase I Report issued on October 17, 2008, Project Grey Goose concluded that \"the Russian government will likely continue its practice of distancing itself from the Russian nationalistic hacker community thus gaining deniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their actions.\"¹⁰⁷ The group was unable to find any direct link to Russian state organizations guiding the attacks, but maintained that there is significant historical evidence that Russian officials endorse cyber warfare initiated by their country's hacker community.¹⁰⁸ For example, General Vladislav Sherstyuk, the current Russian Federation Security Council Deputy Secretary and former Deputy Director of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information, stated in 2002 that \"strike-capable military computer viruses\" would be used in the cyber battlefield.¹⁰⁹ Furthermore, a letter from a Russian Duma member stated in March 2006: \"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers, that is hackers.\"¹¹⁰\nAs Project Grey Goose noted, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is no connection between Russian hackers and the\n104.

There has been consistent support from members of the Russian government and essentially an implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hackers’ attacks.¹¹¹ If indeed the Russian government or persons acting on behalf of the Russian government were responsible for the attacks on Georgian sites, then the only question as to the applicability of IHL would be whether such attacks resulted in death, damage, destruction, or injury.\nBesides the possibility of ordinary Russian citizens being responsible for the attacks, analysts have also accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a network of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and government, of the Georgian attacks.¹¹² Visits to Georgian government websites seemingly were re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey where the traffic was blocked. According to experts, these servers are widely known to be under the control of the RBN and influenced by the Russian government.¹¹³ If the RBN were acting on behalf of the Russian government, then this would constitute conduct by a state.¹¹⁴\nIf the actors were civilians, the problem in applying IHL becomes more complex. Even civilians or non-state actors who attempt to neutralize an enemy network, via a CNA that results in the aforementioned consequences, could be considered as direct participants in hostilities for purposes of Geneva law.¹¹⁵ This would mean that these civilians are illegal combatants and, therefore, not immune from retaliatory attack.¹¹⁶ Civilians could also be subject\n---\n111. *Id.* at 8.

They could be attacked in retaliation like any other military personnel and could be able to achieve prisoner of war status. Again, the situation becomes more problematic when the technicians that act for the nation or military are not incorporated into the armed forces, but rather are simply computer-savvy civilians.¹¹⁸\n## B. Defining Military Objectives\nAs mentioned above, in the context of military operations, only military objectives may be directly attacked. The definition of military objectives as provided in Additional Protocol I may be considered a part of CIL. Under Article 52(2) of the Protocol, \"military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\"¹¹⁹ Military equipment and their facilities, other than medical and religious structures, are clearly military objectives and, therefore, subject to direct cyber attacks.¹²⁰\nThe problem arises, however, when dual-use objects, objects that serve both military and civilian purposes such as airports and bridges, are targeted. The source of the dilemma in clearly defining military objectives versus non-military objectives is in interpreting the terms found in Article 52 of Additional Protocol I.¹²¹ Commentaries to the Protocol seem to define military objectives more narrowly, stating that they are objects \"directly used by the armed forces,\" locations \"of special importance for military operations,\" and objects intended for use or being used\n---\n¹¹⁷.

Chances are that if the attack results in none of the aforementioned consequences, the fact that a civilian object was targeted will probably be of little concern. This again underscores why the results of a cyber attack are central to the legal analysis.\n## C. The Attacks on Georgian Websites Likely Do Not Amount to an Instance of Armed Conflict, Such That IHL Governs\nAssuming that Russia was responsible for the cyber attacks on Georgia, the next question must be whether IHL governs this conflict. While the cyber attacks on Georgia appeared to eventually be part of a classic conflict in which the Russian military later invaded Georgia, the cyber conflict itself did not result in the kinds of consequences necessary to rise to the level of an armed conflict. As previously mentioned, during the cyber conflict, major Georgian servers were brought down, resulting in confusion throughout the country and hindering communication.¹²⁴ An argument could be made, perhaps, that damage or destruction was done to Georgian property, even if death or injury did not occur. Nevertheless, because it appears that the main results of the Georgian attacks were confusion and inconvenience, the attacks were thus permissible, regardless of whether the targets were deemed military or non-military objectives.¹²⁵\nEven so, cyber attacks that result in confusion, miscommunication, or the temporary shutdown of networks are serious problems, and can be harmful to countries that rely heavily on the Internet. Furthermore, it is entirely possible for the shutdown of a nation’s major websites to lead to far greater consequences.\nBecause investigators in one country do not ordinarily have the authority to cross international borders, the investigation into\n122. *Id.* at 380.\n123. *Id.* at 380-81.\n124.

Law enforcement or national security personnel cannot unilaterally pursue investigations into networks located in other countries.¹²⁶ Just as it is difficult to determine who conducted a cyber attack, it is equally difficult to determine what a permissible retaliatory response to this kind of attack is, especially when the attack inflicts minimal damage. In the absence of death or widespread destruction, whether the international community would consider a conventional military attack a proportionate response is questionable.¹²⁷ For example, although the United States recognizes that initial patterns of attack or infiltration can rise to the level of an armed attack, it takes the position that reprisals involving armed conflict or the use of force are illegal. The United States thus justifies a responsive use of force in the exercise of the right of self-defense.¹²⁸ Some also argue that cyber attacks require an expansion of the definition of the use of force, such that there would be greater permissible responses through self-defense.¹²⁹ But expanding the definition in order to create greater conflict is not necessary and does not serve any legitimate purpose, particularly when the initial attack does not result in widespread destruction or loss of life. Moreover, legal developments in this area should move in the direction of narrowing the permissible causes for armed conflict, not enlarging them.\nThe 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict provides a good example of how the many uncertainties and novelties of cyber warfare make the application of IHL difficult in certain instances. It is especially hard when determining responsibility for attacks or clearly defining the distinction between military and non-military objectives. An analysis of the Georgian attacks is meant to highlight the types of issues that arise when applying IHL to such conduct. This does not mean that IHL is not the proper regime to\n126. BRYAN W.

What is clear, however, is that cyber attacks should only be undertaken in a way that respects international law principles.\n## V. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND POWERFUL STATES MUST SET FORTH MORE EXPLICIT AND TRANSPARENT POLICIES REGARDING CYBER WARFARE ISSUES IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING IHL PRINCIPLES\nExisting principles governing the law of war need not be abandoned in the era of modern warfare. Rather, existing rules and mechanisms simply need to be applied in novel ways and old tenets of warfare must be rethought. The challenges, as well as the opportunities, of cyber warfare need to be better understood, and its laws and procedures need to be updated to accommodate the changes in global technology. Over the past few years, some states and international organizations have devoted considerable effort to devise and implement preventative measures aimed at ensuring better compliance with IHL in the event of a cyber attack.¹³¹ Expert seminars have been assembled to discuss various ideas and proposals, particularly through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).¹³² Many participants have acknowledged a positive obligation on states not involved in an armed conflict to take action against states that are violating IHL, particularly by using their influences to stop the violations.¹³³\nSome argue that a new international accord or treaty must be created in order to deal specifically with cyber warfare.¹³⁴ The rationale is that the Internet takes advantage of legal loopholes where state and non-state actors can ignore traditional Western notions of war as described by IHL and, therefore, more international laws are needed to apply directly to cyberspace.¹³⁵\n---\n¹³⁰. *Contra*.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\nInternational treaties, however, would not offer any real alternative to developing and continuing the dialogue among nations, and would likely complicate the issues at stake.¹³⁶ While technological improvements and transparent policies can help nations deal with the attribution problem, there still must be greater discourse regarding cyber warfare issues in order to clear up existing ambiguities.¹³⁷ Cyber warfare, if properly limited, may allow militaries to act on an expanded list of targets while also avoiding the loss of civilian lives.¹³⁸ In other words, cyber warfare could play an important niche role, by supplementing or amplifying more traditional forms of warfare.\nInternational organizations and states should continue their open dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues and should strive for transparency in their policies, such that there are clear international guidelines for how states can permissibly use computers to carry out attacks either independently or part and parcel of a traditional armed conflict. The international legal community must extend the existing IHL framework to apply to cyber warfare, and states must evolve new norms in the form of custom or codification based on experience.¹³⁹\n## A. The Role of International Organizations\nThe International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a specialized intergovernmental organization with state members and private organizational members.¹⁴⁰ Founded in 1865, it is now a constituent part of the UN. While the ITU's main purpose is adopting international regulations governing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, the organization's agenda also includes developing a global information infrastructure.¹⁴¹ In developing standards for online security and digital certificates, the ITU could also attempt to establish standards dealing with cyber attacks and information warfare. Regulations promulgated under the ITU\n136. See Kelsey, supra note 39, at 1449-50 (noting that the creation and enforcement of a new treaty for cyber warfare would prove to be difficult).\n137.

Even if there were stiffer repercussions, a country might still decide that these consequences would not outweigh its need to conduct operations against a particular adversary.¹⁴³ Because of the importance of satellites for international telecommunications, as well as for military command, control, and intelligence, some forms of cyber warfare may involve orbital assets and, thus, implicate the ITU and other telecommunication regulators.¹⁴⁴ Despite these concerns, the work of the ITU could still prove to be valuable in increasing international dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues, particularly through the ITU’s Global Cybersecurity Agenda, which works on coordinating responses to cyber attacks.¹⁴⁵\nThe European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was created in 2004 as a response to concerns about cyber security throughout the European Union.¹⁴⁶ Most of the efforts by the European Commission have resulted in creating technical standards specifically with regard to Internet governance, as opposed to supplementing international law norms. ENISA has, however, recognized the complexity of the technological environment and the threat posed by cyber attacks against electronic communications networks on the availability and integrity of the information accessed through these networks, creating a high-risk situation.¹⁴⁷ Similarly, an Asian regional forum, the Telecommunications and Information Working Group of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, has also promoted regional cooperation in fighting cyber attacks and terrorist misuse of cyber\n142.

The Malaysian government supported the establishment of the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism, or IMPACT, in May 2008.¹⁴⁹ IMPACT is focused mostly on the “‘upper end of cyber threats’” or attacks that would damage a nation’s critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control.¹⁵⁰ It is clear that individual nations or governments cannot address cyber warfare issues alone; international cooperation is required.¹⁵¹ The aforementioned organizations recognize the difficulties in applying IHL principles to cyber attacks, but are working to establish clearer policies on which nations can rely.\nAs mentioned earlier, a major concern is the ability to attribute a cyber attack to a particular government entity because, although an IP address can be tracked, it does not necessarily mean that a military or government official is behind the keyboard. In the near future, however, Internet anonymity may be lessened, thus making it easier to trace the source of cyber attacks.¹⁵² The UN National Security Agency has been participating in the “IP Traceback” drafting group since the fall of 2008. But this proposal has raised concerns among a number of international organizations. While the upshot of this may be that governments will be able to more effectively track cyber attacks to the source, it is also likely that this type of capability could be misused.¹⁵³ Some people believe that traceback mechanisms will no longer serve much of a purpose because there are too many sources in a DDoS attack to be useful, and the source computer was, in many cases, hacked in the first place.¹⁵⁴\nWhile the UN has no power to impose Internet standards on the world,¹⁵⁵ it has been lobbying for more influence over the way\n148.

While international organizations should continue to advocate transparent policies on cyber warfare in order to assist states, resorting to over-management of the Internet is not the right solution.\n## B. States Should Develop Clearly Defined Cyber Strategies and Comprehensive Government-Network Defenses\nThe conduct and practices of states are itself a major source of CIL and would assist in supplementing conventional norms regarding the law of war and its application to cyber warfare. Particularly, China and the United States serve as examples of states working to establish strong national policies on cyber attacks.\nThe Chinese military and nationally supported groups have prepared detailed plans regarding cyber attacks as a way to achieve electronic dominance.¹⁵⁷ China’s ambitions extend to crippling an enemy’s financial, military, and communications capabilities early in conflict, and there is evidence to indicate that China regards offensive computer operations as essential to taking control in the first stages of war.¹⁵⁸ Furthermore, China has developed viruses to attack enemy computers and has even recently hacked into the White House computer network.¹⁵⁹ While these plans may raise numerous concerns for other nations, China’s push to make cyber warfare an integral part of their national army is prudent. The sooner states embrace the concept of cyber warfare, the sooner IHL ambiguities can be resolved.\nEngineering standards are set by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), both of which are voluntary industry organizations. These private agencies have no regulatory power per se, but set standards that de facto control the Internet.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\nBecause cyber attacks are not going to disappear, it is better that states establish clear national policies, such that the rest of the international community can follow suit.\nThe United States has become increasingly concerned about the threats of cyber attacks. In recent years, there have been a series of cyber attacks on military and homeland security computer networks in the United States, many of which have been traced back to China.¹⁶⁰ Presumably as a way to deal with these dangers, the United States has developed cyber warfare contingency plans under the National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 16, which was implemented in 2002.¹⁶¹ The directive, however, has remained classified and, therefore, does little to deter potential enemies. Nevertheless, this directive apparently ordered the development of guidelines to regulate the use of cyber weapons in war. Additionally, NSPD 16 instituted strict rules of engagement requiring “top-level” approval for any such attack.¹⁶² Some people in the United States believe that the nation needs to do more to develop an offensive cyber war capability, similar to that of China.¹⁶³ In all reality, nations will probably not be able to develop a complete military offensive until there is further clarity in determining the attribution of attacks. Furthermore, the lines separating crime, terrorism, and warfare are often hard to draw.¹⁶⁴ Nevertheless, the United States is taking action by attempting to develop and sustain a cyber-force with personnel trained in conducting cyber warfare.¹⁶⁵ More nations should seek to develop transparent standards regarding cyber attacks so that the law can continue to develop and nations can better understand how respond to such attacks.\n160.

The Future of Cyber Warfare: The Cyber Defense Era\nThe near future of cyber warfare will likely resemble that of nuclear defense, in which the growing trend will be for nations to set up cyber defense systems as a way to deter cyber attacks by other nations. Recently, seven NATO countries backed the establishment of a new cyber warfare defense center in Estonia.¹⁶⁶ The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) began operations in the Fall of 2008, and conducts research and training in cyber warfare.¹⁶⁷ A large portion of the CCDCOE’s staff are specialists from the sponsoring countries, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Spain, and the United States has agreed to send an observer.¹⁶⁸ In June 2009, the CCDCOE held a Conference on Cyber Warfare to discuss definitions of cyber warfare and the enhancement of cyber defense capabilities.¹⁶⁹\nIn the near future, there will likely be greater adoption of counter-strategies by states in order to deflect radicalization that is used for inciting violence or attacking enemy infrastructures over the Internet. These strategies might include open-source intelligence gathering and infiltration efforts.¹⁷⁰ In addition, nations may also seek to take advantage of opportunities to use offensive information operations to achieve specific outcomes, including operations to undermine group cohesion and to interfere with decision-making, or to constrain terrorist activities in order to preempt attacks.¹⁷¹ The reason for this is that reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful cyber attacks.¹⁷² Thus, more effective defense measures should incorporate predictive, active, and preemptive elements.¹⁷³\nThe United States, through the Department of Defense (DOD), has also created a program known as Computer Network\n---\n¹⁶⁶.

Additionally, more nations will likely follow the United States’ lead by creating these kinds of defense mechanisms in the near future.\n## VI. CONCLUSION\nCyberspace has been in existence for a number of years, but government entities are increasingly taking advantage of this domain as a way to carry out various kinds of war-like attacks with the help of computers. This raises many concerns, given that major aspects of a nation’s critical or physical infrastructure are connected to cyberspace.¹⁷⁷\nThis article has shown that international laws that are currently in place do address the ever-changing nature of warfare. The Geneva Conventions, as well as the IHL principles of proportionality and unnecessary suffering, all provide a framework for addressing cyber warfare issues. The international legal community, however, must continue to work to address certain ambiguities that exist in applying IHL so that nations have a clear understanding as to how to go about carrying out or defending against a cyber attack. The key for states and international organizations in the upcoming years is to find better, more efficient ways to determine who is responsible for particular cyber attacks and to establish more transparent national policies regarding evolving cyber warfare issues. Although cyber attacks are usually not immediately directed at human beings, they do have the potential to indirectly cause severe injuries or even\n174. *Id.* at 2.\n175. *Id.* at 4.\n176. *Id.* at 12.\n177. *Solce, supra note 22, at 302.*\n2010]                                                                 The Era of Cyber Warfare                                                              333\ndeath.¹⁷⁸ The effects of a cyber attack will determine whether it is classified as an armed conflict for purposes of IHL. Additionally, the outcome of the attack will drive the victim-nation’s response.\nScience fiction literature and film are replete with future wars in which enemy nations or worlds disrupt civilian and military communications networks as a way to gain military and economic control.¹⁷⁹ Except that this is no longer science fiction. As early as 2001, it was recognized by the international community that cyber warfare would be a major threat in the future.¹⁸⁰\nAs expected, there are competing theories for how to best handle these changes in war tactics. Some advocate that a nation’s military should actually create a “Cyber Force” that focuses entirely on cyber attacks.¹⁸¹ Others argue that cyber attacks only produce a limited breadth of damage and, therefore, are not a major threat such that there should be international legal concerns.¹⁸² Nevertheless, the unpredictable consequences and unexpected adversarial advantages that stem from a cyber attack can be just as destructive and damaging as a physical attack. Accordingly, states and international organizations must take proactive stances toward establishing national cyber security strategies and adhering to international legal norms, with the recognition that cyber warfare is here to stay.\n---\n¹⁷⁸.

INTRODUCTION In early August 2008, a full-scale war broke out between Russia and Georgia over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a pro-Russian autonomous region of Georgia.¹ Bombs were dropped throughout the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, with Russian bombers targeting Georgia’s economic infrastructure, including the country’s largest Black Sea port, Poti, and the main road connecting the southern part of Georgia with the East.² In the two months leading up to this conflict, Georgia’s Internet infrastructure was also attacked and major Georgian website servers were brought down, hindering communication and causing confusion throughout the country.³ The kind of attacks used is known as distributed denial of service attacks.⁴ They are triggered * Senior Production Editor, Loyola of Los Angeles International &amp; Comparative Law Review (ILR), Volume 32; J.D., Loyola Law School, 2010; B.A., University of Southern California, 2007. I am grateful for the helpful comments and critiques of Professor Karl Manheim and the students of ILR. Most importantly, I want to thank my parents, my brother and sister, and Alex for their constant encouragement, support, and love.\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] when computers in a network are simultaneously ordered to bombard a website with millions of requests, which then overload the website server and cause it to shut down.⁵ These cyber attacks mainly hindered the Georgian government's ability to communicate with its citizens, as well as other nations, both before and during the physical invasion by Russia.⁶ Official Georgian websites, including those for the President's office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Defense were disabled, at least temporarily.⁷ Even after a cease-fire between the nations was ordered shortly after the physical invasion by Russia, major Georgian servers remained inoperable.⁸ The Russian-Georgian cyber conflict, which was perhaps the first time that cyber attacks were used alongside conventional military action,⁹ illustrates the havoc that can spread on the digital battlefield and re-energizes the debate over whether the laws of war apply to this new kind of warfare.\nWhether the world is prepared or not, cyber weapons are becoming a staple of modern war. Combat no longer consists solely of physical attacks or invasions among nations with distinct military units. This new kind of warfare uses a target nation's own technology against it, in order to bring down vital infrastructure.¹⁰ As Internet and computer technology continues to develop, so too will the methods and means of warfare. Moreover, given the low cost and wide availability of computers, as well as the ability to operate them anonymously, cyber attacks make for an attractive method of warfare.¹¹ In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks, both by nations and by non-state actors.¹²\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nCurrently, there is no provision in international humanitarian law (IHL)¹⁶ or customary international law (CIL)¹⁷ that explicitly outlaws cyber warfare or computer network attacks, either carried out independently or during times of war. This is understandable since the law of war dates back to the nineteenth century and has not yet been updated for applicability in the Information Age.¹⁸ Nonetheless, some legal restraints do apply.\nThis article argues that existing IHL principles should be used to analyze the legality of cyber attacks. Part II of this article discusses the increasing use of cyber warfare in international conflict. Part III of this article explains that IHL principles apply whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a state, are more than simply sporadic in nature and are intended to cause, or will foreseeably cause, injury, death, damage, or destruction. On the other hand, IHL most likely does not apply in the absence of those Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] consequences. Part IV applies IHL principles to the 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict. Given the complexities and novelties involved in this new kind of warfare, however, Part V further proposes that the international community and powerful states should seek to supplement existing IHL principles with more explicit and transparent policies that best correspond to modern Internet technology and address the ways in which this technology can legally be used to carry out cyber attacks.\nIn sum, this article addresses the use of cyber or computer network attacks and considers how jus in bello, or the body of law concerned with what is permissible during hostilities, governs such conflict.¹⁹ This article ultimately seeks to answer the question: “Does a cyber attack constitute an act of war such that international humanitarian law principles apply and govern its use?”\n## II. RECENT CYBER ATTACKS ILLUSTRATE HOW STATES ARE MORE FORCEFULLY ENGAGING IN CYBER WARFARE AS A MEANS TO WEAKEN OPPONENTS’ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES The Internet has emerged as a powerful tool for government functions, information, and mobilization, as well as commerce and social networking.²⁰ It has even become a way to disseminate ideological and political messages.²¹ With the increase in utilization of the Internet for more than just economic and social functions, the international community must be aware that it can also serve as a tool for conducting operations that lead to confusion, destruction, and even death. Examples of cyber attacks against nations in recent history underscore the potential implications in using the Internet as a weapon in war, as well as how there is now clear international recognition of cyberspace as a battlefield. This is evidenced by the fact that information warfare systems are currently being developed and used by at least 120 countries, including Peru, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Croatia, Vietnam, and Russia.²² In order to fully understand cyber attacks and their 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 307 implications, one must first define cyber warfare and its related concepts.\n## A. What is Cyber Warfare?\nThe U.S. Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”²³ Such harm could be inflicted on the computer network, as well as to physical facilities and persons. Cyber attacks are distinct from cyber crimes, which are governed by national criminal statutes and include such acts as identity theft and Internet fraud.²⁴ Cyber attacks, unlike cyber crimes, involve “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”²⁵ In order to fully comprehend what is meant by cyber warfare, the concept of “cyberspace” should also be explored. Essentially, cyberspace is the sum of electronic networks including, but not limited to, the Internet, where various information operations occur.²⁶ Information warfare, on the other hand, is narrower than information operations and is defined as “information operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict to achieve or promote Christensen, *Bracing for Guerrilla Warfare in Cyberspace: ‘There are Lots of Opportunities; That’s Very Scary’*, CNN.COM, Apr. 6, 1999, http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/cyberterror/).\n\nspecific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries.”²⁷ Information warfare has been conducted since at least the sixth century BC.²⁸ Even before the rise of cyberspace, warring parties used electronic deception and disruption as essential ingredients of “real war.” For instance, the U.S. Air Force has had information warfare squadrons since the 1980s, which were used successfully during the first Gulf War.²⁹ Information operations is an evolving discipline within many nations’s militaries.\nCyber warfare is simply the latest form of information warfare,³⁰ and can include computer network attacks (CNA), which consist of “operations to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers or computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”³¹ A CNA essentially involves the “hacking” of another nation’s computer network, but uses data systems, as opposed to physical weapons, to execute the attack.³² ## B. Recent Cyber Attacks and the Resulting Damage Cyber attacks that have taken place in the past few years illustrate how states are utilizing modern technology and more forcefully engaging in information warfare to weaken opponents’ critical infrastructures. There is significant international concern that hostile foreign governments could preemptively launch computer-based attacks on integral national or regional systems, such as those supporting energy distribution, telecommunications, 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 309 and financial services.³³ Since everything from transportation to commodity supply to health care to public safety to military operations now relies on computer information systems,³⁴ cyber attacks have the potential to cause far greater damage than conventional weapons.\nRecent publicly-known cyber attacks include attacks on Lithuanian commercial and government websites in June 2008, attacks on Estonian government websites in 2007, an e-mail breach in the Pentagon in June 2007, and hacks into Pakistan’s state-owned telephone company’s website in January 2003.³⁵ Around August 2008, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks temporarily disabled official Georgian websites, including those for the President’s office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Defense, and led to communication problems throughout the country.³⁶ Even more recently, it has been discovered that Chinese hackers have breached the White House computer networks on numerous occasions, obtaining e-mail communication exchanged among government officials.³⁷ Additionally, the damage caused by many of these attacks included injury, death, and property damage. In perhaps the most extreme example, the 2007 attacks on Estonian websites caused more than just confusion for the nation’s population. At the time of these attacks, Estonia had essentially instituted an “e-government” where many aspects of the government were carried Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] out online.³⁸ In addition to bringing down many of Estonia's critical government and commercial websites, the cyber attacks also caused the emergency phone number used for calling ambulances and the fire service to be unavailable for more than one hour.³⁹ As a result, widespread social unrest and rioting left 150 people injured and one Russian national dead.⁴⁰ In contrast, the Lithuanian attacks involved the defacement of government and commercial websites with anti-Lithuanian rhetoric and communist symbols.⁴¹ The government, however, was able to prepare sufficient defenses to these attacks.⁴² These two examples demonstrate that the damage from a cyber attack can often be unpredictable.\n## C. The Methods Used in Carrying Out a Cyber Attack Cyber weapons are not like traditional weapons of warfare. Individuals or nations that use cyber weapons may choose from a variety of options, including syntactic, semantic, and mixed weapons.⁴³ Syntactic weapons, which target a computer's operating system, include malicious code, such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, DDoS, and spyware.⁴⁴ Through DDoS attacks, like those used against Georgia, the cyber attacker shuts down a website by bombarding it with large amounts of traffic.⁴⁵ Conversely, semantic weapons target\"the accuracy of information to which the computer user has access.\"⁴⁶ In other words, a semantic attack consists of altering information that enters the computer's system 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 311 in order to produce errors without the user’s knowledge.⁴⁷ Mixed or blended weapons combine syntactic and semantic weapons to attack both information and the computer’s operating system, resulting in a more sophisticated attack.⁴⁸ An example of a mixed weapon is a “bot network,” which is a proliferation of “bots,” surreptitiously planted on innocent third-party computers. Bots are remote-controlled computer programs that infect other computers. A hacker who controls the bots can spy, copy, and transmit sensitive data, as well as organize the bots in a swarm attack against targeted computers.⁴⁹ Attacked computers or networks are systems that have been infected with malicious software through the use of these weapons, and that are then brought under the control of an attacker in a remote location.⁵⁰ Infected devices continually listen for commands from the attacker and act upon them, with the intention of compromising the opponent’s security or critical infrastructure.⁵¹ The Internet was originally a network of computers linked to the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s and 1970s.⁵² As the computer networks of universities and private research facilities merged through the development of hypertext, a global network with benefits to both military and civilian sectors was created.⁵³ The new technology, however, has also created vulnerabilities for nations that rely heavily on the Internet, especially in their military and governmental infrastructures.⁵⁴ This has created an opportunity for warring parties to exploit network vulnerabilities with various cyber weapons and attacks.\n--- Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] ## III. INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW SHOULD GOVERN THE LEGALITY OF CYBER ATTACKS WHEN SUCH ATTACKS CONSTITUTE ARMED CONFLICT Information gathering and disruption have always been major tools of war. Disrupting an enemy's communications networks may even have greater strategic value than destroying its arsenals or supply lines. Indeed, some information warfare methods are considered so unsavory as to be prohibited by the laws of war.\nWhile a cyber attack is not truly kinetic or physical in nature like traditional forms of weaponry, a cyber attack may still lead to major physical destruction and even death.55 Therefore, because of these possible consequences, a cyber attack could constitute an armed conflict, such that IHL governs, if certain criteria are met. The threshold question is under what circumstances can a cyber attack be deemed an armed conflict, such that IHL applies. This is an important question because its answer provides guidance to nations on how they can respond to such attacks in a way that is consistent with international legal norms.\n## A. International Humanitarian Law Background IHL is the branch of public international law that\"seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering which it causes.\"56 It is one of two principle divisions of the laws of war and is termed jus in bello, or the\"law in war.\"57 The other division is known as jus ad bellum, or the\"law to war,\"which governs the legality of resorting to armed force.58 The terms\"law of war\"and\"law of armed conflict\"are synonymous.\nJus in bello traditionally involves both Geneva and Hague law. Geneva law rests on the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols.59 These treaties are particularly concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict, with Additional Protocol I focusing on the means and methods of warfare. Conversely, Hague law refers to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, and is mainly concerned with methods and means of warfare, tactics, and the general conduct of hostilities. In modern\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\n## B. The Applicability of IHL to Cyber Attacks\nThe law of armed conflict, as a part of international law, is binding on states, yet a violation may also involve the prosecution of individuals for war crimes.⁶¹ Some have argued that IHL cannot govern cyber attacks because there is nothing physical or kinetic about such operations.⁶² In other words, a CNA is not an armed conflict in the true sense of the phrase and, therefore, such an attack falls outside of the scope of IHL. Article 2, which is common to all four of the Geneva Conventions, provides that “[i]n addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”⁶³ Additional Protocol I also relies on this same “armed conflict” language. Article 1(3) of Additional Protocol I states that “[t]his Protocol, which supplements the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims, shall apply in the situations referred to in Article 2 common to those Conventions.”⁶⁴ Thus, in order for IHL to govern a cyber attack, such an attack must in fact constitute an armed conflict.\nNevertheless, commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their subsequent Additional Protocols have posited that “armed conflict” can be viewed in a fairly expansive way.⁶⁵ Armed conflict has been defined as “any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces.”⁶⁶ A\n⁶⁰. *Id.*\n⁶¹.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\ndispute resulting in the engagement of armed forces, however, cannot be the sole criterion. For example, the replacement of border police with soldiers or an accidental border incursion by members of the armed forces would not amount to an armed conflict.67 Thus, some degree of intensity and duration must be considered, as underlying principles of IHL make clear.68 IHL is founded upon the idea that victims of armed conflict, including personnel who have been rendered hors de combat,69 are entitled to protection.70 This protection is “usually framed in terms of injury, death, or in the case of property, damage or destruction.”71 Therefore, fundamental principles of IHL provide that armed conflict occurs when a group takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy,72 thereby narrowing the definition of armed conflict and limiting its applicability.\nFrom the above discussion, it logically follows that a cyber attack may constitute armed conflict, even though the use of a computer as a weapon is not a traditional or physical method of warfare, as long as certain consequences arise. While cyber attacks employ modern technology not conceived of during the drafting of the Geneva Conventions, the language of Additional Protocol I, and in particular Article 36, indicate that the drafters anticipated the application of the rules to new developments in warfare methods.73 The law of armed conflict must change and develop to account for new humanitarian imperatives that may be generated\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nAdditional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides important guidance in assessing the applicability of IHL to cyber attacks. Additional Protocol I codifies many existing principles of CIL and introduces important new treaty provisions relating to international armed conflict.77 Some provisions of Additional Protocol I are controversial such that they are said to only bind state parties to the treaty and, thus, they do not reflect customary law.78 Nevertheless, the significance of Additional Protocol I, as it relates to cyber warfare specifically and jus in bello generally, is that it supplements the original Geneva Conventions as they apply to civilians in an armed conflict as well as to the prohibited methods of warfare in situations of conflict.79 A key aspect of Additional Protocol I is the “doctrine of unnecessary suffering,” which is fundamental to jus in bello in general.80 Article 35 states: “In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.”81 This principle serves to place some limits on the barbarity and the range of means and weapons Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] that are available in today's modern society. Furthermore, Additional Protocol I was the first treaty to set out specifically the principle of proportionality, which requires that the losses resulting from military action should not be excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.⁸² Proportionality closely relates to the concept of indiscriminate attacks. Article 51(5)(b) describes an indiscriminate attack as one that\"may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\"⁸³ These principles are important to cyber warfare because they require that the attacker refrain from attacks that may be expected to cause excessive collateral damage.⁸⁴ Similar to nuclear weapons, cyber weapons are arguably sui generis or, in other words, they are unique in their characteristics and therefore should be governed by a unique set of laws.⁸⁵ Nevertheless, cyber weapons, just like nuclear weapons, are weapons that result in consequences similar to that of traditional weapons. Accordingly, IHL principles, such as the concept of unnecessary suffering and proportionality, still have relevance in the case of a cyber attack. Often, the question simply will be: To what extent do these principles apply? While some uncertainties remain, what is clear from this discussion is that an\"armed conflict\"occurs when an actor takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy, regardless of the weapon used.⁸⁶ Scholars agree that an armed conflict exists and IHL governs once kinetic weapons are used in combination with CNAs.⁸⁷ The question becomes more difficult when computer networks conduct the first or only hostile acts. The key in assessing such conduct, however, is the effects or consequences of the attacks. Based on this framework, IHL applies whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a ⁸².

See APPLICABILITY OF THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS TO COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS, supra note 73, at 2.\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare The reason why a consequence-based approach is necessary in analyzing the application of IHL to cyber attacks is because once armed conflict has commenced, the means by which injury, death, damage, or destruction are produced has no bearing on the legality of that conduct.⁹⁰ Thus, a lone cyber attack is subject to IHL if these particular consequences result.\nArticle 48 of Additional Protocol I mandates that parties to a conflict direct their operations against military objectives.⁹¹ Thus, targeting a military object, such as military air traffic control system, would be permissible. Since it is often the case that a CNA would target not purely military objectives, the next question is whether targeting civilian computer networks or systems are permissible. Based on the language of Article 48, however, the prohibition is not so much on targeting non-military objectives as it is on attacking them through acts of violence.⁹² Consequently, IHL would prohibit cyber attacks directed against non-military objectives that are intended to, or would foreseeably, cause injury, death, destruction, or damage.⁹³ On the other hand, an attack targeting a non-military objective that is not likely to result in the aforementioned consequences would be permissible.⁹⁴ --- ⁸⁸.

THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN CYBER CONFLICT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITIES IN APPLYING IHL TO CYBER ATTACKS\nSince IHL may apply to cyber warfare in certain situations depending on the results of an attack, it is not necessary to create a completely new set of laws or form a new treaty to apply solely to cyber attacks. Nevertheless, applying IHL to the 2008 cyber conflict involving Russia and Georgia illustrates the difficulties in being able to implement fully IHL in these instances and to articulate concretely the reactions to such attacks. The most notable difficulties involve attributing responsibility for the attacks and determining the difference between military objectives and non-military objectives in the context of targeted websites and computer systems.\n### A. Was Russia Responsible for the Attacks on Georgian Websites?\nBoth Russia and Georgia are state parties to Additional Protocol I, which pertains to the protection of victims of international armed conflict.⁹⁵ Thus, as parties to the treaty, its provisions bind them, including the duty before carrying out an attack to “do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are . . . military objectives.”⁹⁶ Even for states not a party to the Protocol, customary law would still require their forces to attack only military objectives, meaning that these targets must be distinguished from civilian objectives.⁹⁷ The Institute of International Law even points out that existing international law prohibits the use of all weapons that, by their nature, affect indiscriminately both military and non-military objectives.⁹⁸\nAdditional Protocol I further requires that in the time of armed conflict, states must ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to counsel military commanders regarding the application of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol\n---\n⁹⁵. The list of state parties to Additional Protocol I is also located at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&amp;id=470&amp;ps=P.\n⁹⁶.

Nevertheless, given the relatively small amount of equipment required to launch a cyber attack and the pervasiveness of the Internet, ascertaining whether Russia, as opposed to non-state actors, was responsible for the attacks on Georgian websites, such that legal implications are created, is extremely difficult. Conversely, actually engaging in cyber war or bombarding a website is relatively simple. As demonstrated by one reporter, all one needs to do is save a copy of a certain Georgian web page to one’s hard drive and then open it on the computer’s browser. Once accessed, the page will load thumb-nailed versions of a dozen key Georgian websites in a single window. All the cyber “soldier” must do is set the page to update automatically every three to five seconds and from then on the browser will continue to send thousands of queries to the most important Georgian websites, helping to overload them and bring them down.⁹⁹ This is the simple way of bringing down a website, but there are more sophisticated and creative options, including obtaining certain kinds of software to carry out DDoS attacks.¹⁰¹\nThe evidence is currently not clear whether Russia was involved in the shutdown of Georgian websites or whether the attacks can be attributed to non-state actors.¹⁰² Jose Nazario, an Internet security specialist, believes that non-state actors likely caused the attacks on Georgian websites, because there is a history of the kind of botnet attacks involved previously attacking commercial or non-political targets.¹⁰³ Cyber attacks are often difficult to trace and it can take several months to reach definitive answers. For example, in 1998 an investigation by U.S. intelligence\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] officials initially linked Iraq to a series of breaches of the Department of Defense computers. The real suspects ended up being two teenagers in Northern California.¹⁰⁴ Project Grey Goose, an open-source initiative launched on August 22, 2008, has examined the Russian-Georgian cyber war and has drawn conclusions regarding the Russian government's involvement in the attacks.¹⁰⁵ The group based its conclusion on data collected from two Russian hacker forums, www.xakep.ru and www.stopgeorgian.ru, along with network log files detailing 29,000 status events indicating the up/down status of 149 Georgian websites.¹⁰⁶ In its Phase I Report issued on October 17, 2008, Project Grey Goose concluded that\"the Russian government will likely continue its practice of distancing itself from the Russian nationalistic hacker community thus gaining deniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their actions.\"¹⁰⁷ The group was unable to find any direct link to Russian state organizations guiding the attacks, but maintained that there is significant historical evidence that Russian officials endorse cyber warfare initiated by their country's hacker community.¹⁰⁸ For example, General Vladislav Sherstyuk, the current Russian Federation Security Council Deputy Secretary and former Deputy Director of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information, stated in 2002 that\"strike-capable military computer viruses\"would be used in the cyber battlefield.¹⁰⁹ Furthermore, a letter from a Russian Duma member stated in March 2006:\"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers, that is hackers.\"¹¹⁰ As Project Grey Goose noted, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is no connection between Russian hackers and the 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 321 Russian government. There has been consistent support from members of the Russian government and essentially an implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hackers’ attacks.¹¹¹ If indeed the Russian government or persons acting on behalf of the Russian government were responsible for the attacks on Georgian sites, then the only question as to the applicability of IHL would be whether such attacks resulted in death, damage, destruction, or injury.\nBesides the possibility of ordinary Russian citizens being responsible for the attacks, analysts have also accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a network of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and government, of the Georgian attacks.¹¹² Visits to Georgian government websites seemingly were re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey where the traffic was blocked. According to experts, these servers are widely known to be under the control of the RBN and influenced by the Russian government.¹¹³ If the RBN were acting on behalf of the Russian government, then this would constitute conduct by a state.¹¹⁴ If the actors were civilians, the problem in applying IHL becomes more complex. Even civilians or non-state actors who attempt to neutralize an enemy network, via a CNA that results in the aforementioned consequences, could be considered as direct participants in hostilities for purposes of Geneva law.¹¹⁵ This would mean that these civilians are illegal combatants and, therefore, not immune from retaliatory attack.¹¹⁶ Civilians could also be subject --- Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. [Vol. 32:303] to criminal prosecution under domestic law for the mere fact of taking part in hostilities.¹¹⁷ If the actors who carried out the cyber attacks against Georgia were members of Russia's armed forces, such personnel would have all the rights and liabilities of combatants. They could be attacked in retaliation like any other military personnel and could be able to achieve prisoner of war status. Again, the situation becomes more problematic when the technicians that act for the nation or military are not incorporated into the armed forces, but rather are simply computer-savvy civilians.¹¹⁸ ## B. Defining Military Objectives As mentioned above, in the context of military operations, only military objectives may be directly attacked. The definition of military objectives as provided in Additional Protocol I may be considered a part of CIL. Under Article 52(2) of the Protocol,\"military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\"¹¹⁹ Military equipment and their facilities, other than medical and religious structures, are clearly military objectives and, therefore, subject to direct cyber attacks.¹²⁰ The problem arises, however, when dual-use objects, objects that serve both military and civilian purposes such as airports and bridges, are targeted. The source of the dilemma in clearly defining military objectives versus non-military objectives is in interpreting the terms found in Article 52 of Additional Protocol I.¹²¹ Commentaries to the Protocol seem to define military objectives more narrowly, stating that they are objects\"directly used by the armed forces,\"locations\"of special importance for military operations,\"and objects intended for use or being used --- ¹¹⁷.

See Wired Warfare, supra note 27, at 380, 384-85.\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 323 for military purposes.¹²² In contrast, nations like the United States take a more expansive approach by including economic targets as military objectives.¹²³ Essentially, once the determination is made whether a cyber attack caused injury, death, damage or destruction, opinions will likely differ on whether the intended target was a civilian or military object. Chances are that if the attack results in none of the aforementioned consequences, the fact that a civilian object was targeted will probably be of little concern. This again underscores why the results of a cyber attack are central to the legal analysis.\n## C. The Attacks on Georgian Websites Likely Do Not Amount to an Instance of Armed Conflict, Such That IHL Governs Assuming that Russia was responsible for the cyber attacks on Georgia, the next question must be whether IHL governs this conflict. While the cyber attacks on Georgia appeared to eventually be part of a classic conflict in which the Russian military later invaded Georgia, the cyber conflict itself did not result in the kinds of consequences necessary to rise to the level of an armed conflict. As previously mentioned, during the cyber conflict, major Georgian servers were brought down, resulting in confusion throughout the country and hindering communication.¹²⁴ An argument could be made, perhaps, that damage or destruction was done to Georgian property, even if death or injury did not occur. Nevertheless, because it appears that the main results of the Georgian attacks were confusion and inconvenience, the attacks were thus permissible, regardless of whether the targets were deemed military or non-military objectives.¹²⁵ Even so, cyber attacks that result in confusion, miscommunication, or the temporary shutdown of networks are serious problems, and can be harmful to countries that rely heavily on the Internet. Furthermore, it is entirely possible for the shutdown of a nation’s major websites to lead to far greater consequences.\nBecause investigators in one country do not ordinarily have the authority to cross international borders, the investigation into Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] the source of a cyber attack is often difficult. Law enforcement or national security personnel cannot unilaterally pursue investigations into networks located in other countries.¹²⁶ Just as it is difficult to determine who conducted a cyber attack, it is equally difficult to determine what a permissible retaliatory response to this kind of attack is, especially when the attack inflicts minimal damage. In the absence of death or widespread destruction, whether the international community would consider a conventional military attack a proportionate response is questionable.¹²⁷ For example, although the United States recognizes that initial patterns of attack or infiltration can rise to the level of an armed attack, it takes the position that reprisals involving armed conflict or the use of force are illegal. The United States thus justifies a responsive use of force in the exercise of the right of self-defense.¹²⁸ Some also argue that cyber attacks require an expansion of the definition of the use of force, such that there would be greater permissible responses through self-defense.¹²⁹ But expanding the definition in order to create greater conflict is not necessary and does not serve any legitimate purpose, particularly when the initial attack does not result in widespread destruction or loss of life. Moreover, legal developments in this area should move in the direction of narrowing the permissible causes for armed conflict, not enlarging them.\nThe 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict provides a good example of how the many uncertainties and novelties of cyber warfare make the application of IHL difficult in certain instances. It is especially hard when determining responsibility for attacks or clearly defining the distinction between military and non-military objectives. An analysis of the Georgian attacks is meant to highlight the types of issues that arise when applying IHL to such conduct. This does not mean that IHL is not the proper regime to 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 325 deal with cyber attacks in the future.¹³⁰ Rather, it underscores the continued work that must be done by the international community in the upcoming years to more clearly define certain terms and to set forth more transparent policies. What is clear, however, is that cyber attacks should only be undertaken in a way that respects international law principles.\n## V. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND POWERFUL STATES MUST SET FORTH MORE EXPLICIT AND TRANSPARENT POLICIES REGARDING CYBER WARFARE ISSUES IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING IHL PRINCIPLES Existing principles governing the law of war need not be abandoned in the era of modern warfare. Rather, existing rules and mechanisms simply need to be applied in novel ways and old tenets of warfare must be rethought. The challenges, as well as the opportunities, of cyber warfare need to be better understood, and its laws and procedures need to be updated to accommodate the changes in global technology. Over the past few years, some states and international organizations have devoted considerable effort to devise and implement preventative measures aimed at ensuring better compliance with IHL in the event of a cyber attack.¹³¹ Expert seminars have been assembled to discuss various ideas and proposals, particularly through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).¹³² Many participants have acknowledged a positive obligation on states not involved in an armed conflict to take action against states that are violating IHL, particularly by using their influences to stop the violations.¹³³ Some argue that a new international accord or treaty must be created in order to deal specifically with cyber warfare.¹³⁴ The rationale is that the Internet takes advantage of legal loopholes where state and non-state actors can ignore traditional Western notions of war as described by IHL and, therefore, more international laws are needed to apply directly to cyberspace.¹³⁵ --- ¹³⁰. *Contra*.

Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] International treaties, however, would not offer any real alternative to developing and continuing the dialogue among nations, and would likely complicate the issues at stake.¹³⁶ While technological improvements and transparent policies can help nations deal with the attribution problem, there still must be greater discourse regarding cyber warfare issues in order to clear up existing ambiguities.¹³⁷ Cyber warfare, if properly limited, may allow militaries to act on an expanded list of targets while also avoiding the loss of civilian lives.¹³⁸ In other words, cyber warfare could play an important niche role, by supplementing or amplifying more traditional forms of warfare.\nInternational organizations and states should continue their open dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues and should strive for transparency in their policies, such that there are clear international guidelines for how states can permissibly use computers to carry out attacks either independently or part and parcel of a traditional armed conflict. The international legal community must extend the existing IHL framework to apply to cyber warfare, and states must evolve new norms in the form of custom or codification based on experience.¹³⁹ ## A. The Role of International Organizations The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a specialized intergovernmental organization with state members and private organizational members.¹⁴⁰ Founded in 1865, it is now a constituent part of the UN. While the ITU's main purpose is adopting international regulations governing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, the organization's agenda also includes developing a global information infrastructure.¹⁴¹ In developing standards for online security and digital certificates, the ITU could also attempt to establish standards dealing with cyber attacks and information warfare. Regulations promulgated under the ITU\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nThe European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was created in 2004 as a response to concerns about cyber security throughout the European Union.¹⁴⁶ Most of the efforts by the European Commission have resulted in creating technical standards specifically with regard to Internet governance, as opposed to supplementing international law norms. ENISA has, however, recognized the complexity of the technological environment and the threat posed by cyber attacks against electronic communications networks on the availability and integrity of the information accessed through these networks, creating a high-risk situation.¹⁴⁷ Similarly, an Asian regional forum, the Telecommunications and Information Working Group of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, has also promoted regional cooperation in fighting cyber attacks and terrorist misuse of cyber Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] space.¹⁴⁸ Other Asian countries are also looking to bolster cyber defenses. The Malaysian government supported the establishment of the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism, or IMPACT, in May 2008.¹⁴⁹ IMPACT is focused mostly on the “‘upper end of cyber threats’” or attacks that would damage a nation’s critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control.¹⁵⁰ It is clear that individual nations or governments cannot address cyber warfare issues alone; international cooperation is required.¹⁵¹ The aforementioned organizations recognize the difficulties in applying IHL principles to cyber attacks, but are working to establish clearer policies on which nations can rely.\nAs mentioned earlier, a major concern is the ability to attribute a cyber attack to a particular government entity because, although an IP address can be tracked, it does not necessarily mean that a military or government official is behind the keyboard. In the near future, however, Internet anonymity may be lessened, thus making it easier to trace the source of cyber attacks.¹⁵² The UN National Security Agency has been participating in the “IP Traceback” drafting group since the fall of 2008. But this proposal has raised concerns among a number of international organizations. While the upshot of this may be that governments will be able to more effectively track cyber attacks to the source, it is also likely that this type of capability could be misused.¹⁵³ Some people believe that traceback mechanisms will no longer serve much of a purpose because there are too many sources in a DDoS attack to be useful, and the source computer was, in many cases, hacked in the first place.¹⁵⁴ While the UN has no power to impose Internet standards on the world,¹⁵⁵ it has been lobbying for more influence over the way 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 329 the Internet is managed, most prominently through the World Summit on the Information Society.¹⁵⁶ Still, it is unlikely that any sort of mandatory IP Traceback or authentication regime will or could be imposed by national governments or international bodies. While international organizations should continue to advocate transparent policies on cyber warfare in order to assist states, resorting to over-management of the Internet is not the right solution.\n## B. States Should Develop Clearly Defined Cyber Strategies and Comprehensive Government-Network Defenses The conduct and practices of states are itself a major source of CIL and would assist in supplementing conventional norms regarding the law of war and its application to cyber warfare. Particularly, China and the United States serve as examples of states working to establish strong national policies on cyber attacks.\nThe Chinese military and nationally supported groups have prepared detailed plans regarding cyber attacks as a way to achieve electronic dominance.¹⁵⁷ China’s ambitions extend to crippling an enemy’s financial, military, and communications capabilities early in conflict, and there is evidence to indicate that China regards offensive computer operations as essential to taking control in the first stages of war.¹⁵⁸ Furthermore, China has developed viruses to attack enemy computers and has even recently hacked into the White House computer network.¹⁵⁹ While these plans may raise numerous concerns for other nations, China’s push to make cyber warfare an integral part of their national army is prudent. The sooner states embrace the concept of cyber warfare, the sooner IHL ambiguities can be resolved.\nEngineering standards are set by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), both of which are voluntary industry organizations. These private agencies have no regulatory power per se, but set standards that de facto control the Internet. WORKING GROUP ON INTERNET GOVERNANCE, BACKGROUND REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON INTERNET GOVERNANCE (2005), available at http://www.wgig.org/docs/BackgroundReport.pdf.\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] Because cyber attacks are not going to disappear, it is better that states establish clear national policies, such that the rest of the international community can follow suit.\nThe United States has become increasingly concerned about the threats of cyber attacks. In recent years, there have been a series of cyber attacks on military and homeland security computer networks in the United States, many of which have been traced back to China.¹⁶⁰ Presumably as a way to deal with these dangers, the United States has developed cyber warfare contingency plans under the National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 16, which was implemented in 2002.¹⁶¹ The directive, however, has remained classified and, therefore, does little to deter potential enemies. Nevertheless, this directive apparently ordered the development of guidelines to regulate the use of cyber weapons in war. Additionally, NSPD 16 instituted strict rules of engagement requiring “top-level” approval for any such attack.¹⁶² Some people in the United States believe that the nation needs to do more to develop an offensive cyber war capability, similar to that of China.¹⁶³ In all reality, nations will probably not be able to develop a complete military offensive until there is further clarity in determining the attribution of attacks. Furthermore, the lines separating crime, terrorism, and warfare are often hard to draw.¹⁶⁴ Nevertheless, the United States is taking action by attempting to develop and sustain a cyber-force with personnel trained in conducting cyber warfare.¹⁶⁵ More nations should seek to develop transparent standards regarding cyber attacks so that the law can continue to develop and nations can better understand how respond to such attacks.\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 331 ## C. The Future of Cyber Warfare: The Cyber Defense Era The near future of cyber warfare will likely resemble that of nuclear defense, in which the growing trend will be for nations to set up cyber defense systems as a way to deter cyber attacks by other nations. Recently, seven NATO countries backed the establishment of a new cyber warfare defense center in Estonia.¹⁶⁶ The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) began operations in the Fall of 2008, and conducts research and training in cyber warfare.¹⁶⁷ A large portion of the CCDCOE’s staff are specialists from the sponsoring countries, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Spain, and the United States has agreed to send an observer.¹⁶⁸ In June 2009, the CCDCOE held a Conference on Cyber Warfare to discuss definitions of cyber warfare and the enhancement of cyber defense capabilities.¹⁶⁹ In the near future, there will likely be greater adoption of counter-strategies by states in order to deflect radicalization that is used for inciting violence or attacking enemy infrastructures over the Internet. These strategies might include open-source intelligence gathering and infiltration efforts.¹⁷⁰ In addition, nations may also seek to take advantage of opportunities to use offensive information operations to achieve specific outcomes, including operations to undermine group cohesion and to interfere with decision-making, or to constrain terrorist activities in order to preempt attacks.¹⁷¹ The reason for this is that reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful cyber attacks.¹⁷² Thus, more effective defense measures should incorporate predictive, active, and preemptive elements.¹⁷³ The United States, through the Department of Defense (DOD), has also created a program known as Computer Network --- ¹⁶⁶.

Additionally, more nations will likely follow the United States’ lead by creating these kinds of defense mechanisms in the near future.\n## VI. CONCLUSION Cyberspace has been in existence for a number of years, but government entities are increasingly taking advantage of this domain as a way to carry out various kinds of war-like attacks with the help of computers. This raises many concerns, given that major aspects of a nation’s critical or physical infrastructure are connected to cyberspace.¹⁷⁷ This article has shown that international laws that are currently in place do address the ever-changing nature of warfare. The Geneva Conventions, as well as the IHL principles of proportionality and unnecessary suffering, all provide a framework for addressing cyber warfare issues. The international legal community, however, must continue to work to address certain ambiguities that exist in applying IHL so that nations have a clear understanding as to how to go about carrying out or defending against a cyber attack. The key for states and international organizations in the upcoming years is to find better, more efficient ways to determine who is responsible for particular cyber attacks and to establish more transparent national policies regarding evolving cyber warfare issues. Although cyber attacks are usually not immediately directed at human beings, they do have the potential to indirectly cause severe injuries or even 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 333 death.¹⁷⁸ The effects of a cyber attack will determine whether it is classified as an armed conflict for purposes of IHL. Additionally, the outcome of the attack will drive the victim-nation’s response.\nScience fiction literature and film are replete with future wars in which enemy nations or worlds disrupt civilian and military communications networks as a way to gain military and economic control.¹⁷⁹ Except that this is no longer science fiction. As early as 2001, it was recognized by the international community that cyber warfare would be a major threat in the future.¹⁸⁰ As expected, there are competing theories for how to best handle these changes in war tactics. Some advocate that a nation’s military should actually create a “Cyber Force” that focuses entirely on cyber attacks.¹⁸¹ Others argue that cyber attacks only produce a limited breadth of damage and, therefore, are not a major threat such that there should be international legal concerns.¹⁸² Nevertheless, the unpredictable consequences and unexpected adversarial advantages that stem from a cyber attack can be just as destructive and damaging as a physical attack. Accordingly, states and international organizations must take proactive stances toward establishing national cyber security strategies and adhering to international legal norms, with the recognition that cyber warfare is here to stay.\n--- ¹⁷⁸.

INTRODUCTION In early August 2008, a full-scale war broke out between Russia and Georgia over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a pro-Russian autonomous region of Georgia.¹ Bombs were dropped throughout the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, with Russian bombers targeting Georgia’s economic infrastructure, including the country’s largest Black Sea port, Poti, and the main road connecting the southern part of Georgia with the East.² In the two months leading up to this conflict, Georgia’s Internet infrastructure was also attacked and major Georgian website servers were brought down, hindering communication and causing confusion throughout the country.³ The kind of attacks used is known as distributed denial of service attacks.⁴ They are triggered * Senior Production Editor, Loyola of Los Angeles International &amp; Comparative Law Review (ILR), Volume 32; J.D., Loyola Law School, 2010; B.A., University of Southern California, 2007. I am grateful for the helpful comments and critiques of Professor Karl Manheim and the students of ILR. Most importantly, I want to thank my parents, my brother and sister, and Alex for their constant encouragement, support, and love.\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] when computers in a network are simultaneously ordered to bombard a website with millions of requests, which then overload the website server and cause it to shut down.⁵ These cyber attacks mainly hindered the Georgian government's ability to communicate with its citizens, as well as other nations, both before and during the physical invasion by Russia.⁶ Official Georgian websites, including those for the President's office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Defense were disabled, at least temporarily.⁷ Even after a cease-fire between the nations was ordered shortly after the physical invasion by Russia, major Georgian servers remained inoperable.⁸ The Russian-Georgian cyber conflict, which was perhaps the first time that cyber attacks were used alongside conventional military action,⁹ illustrates the havoc that can spread on the digital battlefield and re-energizes the debate over whether the laws of war apply to this new kind of warfare.\nWhether the world is prepared or not, cyber weapons are becoming a staple of modern war. Combat no longer consists solely of physical attacks or invasions among nations with distinct military units. This new kind of warfare uses a target nation's own technology against it, in order to bring down vital infrastructure.¹⁰ As Internet and computer technology continues to develop, so too will the methods and means of warfare. Moreover, given the low cost and wide availability of computers, as well as the ability to operate them anonymously, cyber attacks make for an attractive method of warfare.¹¹ In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks, both by nations and by non-state actors.¹²\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nCurrently, there is no provision in international humanitarian law (IHL)¹⁶ or customary international law (CIL)¹⁷ that explicitly outlaws cyber warfare or computer network attacks, either carried out independently or during times of war. This is understandable since the law of war dates back to the nineteenth century and has not yet been updated for applicability in the Information Age.¹⁸ Nonetheless, some legal restraints do apply.\nThis article argues that existing IHL principles should be used to analyze the legality of cyber attacks. Part II of this article discusses the increasing use of cyber warfare in international conflict. Part III of this article explains that IHL principles apply whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a state, are more than simply sporadic in nature and are intended to cause, or will foreseeably cause, injury, death, damage, or destruction. On the other hand, IHL most likely does not apply in the absence of those Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] consequences. Part IV applies IHL principles to the 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict. Given the complexities and novelties involved in this new kind of warfare, however, Part V further proposes that the international community and powerful states should seek to supplement existing IHL principles with more explicit and transparent policies that best correspond to modern Internet technology and address the ways in which this technology can legally be used to carry out cyber attacks.\nIn sum, this article addresses the use of cyber or computer network attacks and considers how jus in bello, or the body of law concerned with what is permissible during hostilities, governs such conflict.¹⁹ This article ultimately seeks to answer the question: “Does a cyber attack constitute an act of war such that international humanitarian law principles apply and govern its use?”\n## II. RECENT CYBER ATTACKS ILLUSTRATE HOW STATES ARE MORE FORCEFULLY ENGAGING IN CYBER WARFARE AS A MEANS TO WEAKEN OPPONENTS’ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES The Internet has emerged as a powerful tool for government functions, information, and mobilization, as well as commerce and social networking.²⁰ It has even become a way to disseminate ideological and political messages.²¹ With the increase in utilization of the Internet for more than just economic and social functions, the international community must be aware that it can also serve as a tool for conducting operations that lead to confusion, destruction, and even death. Examples of cyber attacks against nations in recent history underscore the potential implications in using the Internet as a weapon in war, as well as how there is now clear international recognition of cyberspace as a battlefield. This is evidenced by the fact that information warfare systems are currently being developed and used by at least 120 countries, including Peru, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Croatia, Vietnam, and Russia.²² In order to fully understand cyber attacks and their 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 307 implications, one must first define cyber warfare and its related concepts.\n## A. What is Cyber Warfare?\nThe U.S. Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”²³ Such harm could be inflicted on the computer network, as well as to physical facilities and persons. Cyber attacks are distinct from cyber crimes, which are governed by national criminal statutes and include such acts as identity theft and Internet fraud.²⁴ Cyber attacks, unlike cyber crimes, involve “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”²⁵ In order to fully comprehend what is meant by cyber warfare, the concept of “cyberspace” should also be explored. Essentially, cyberspace is the sum of electronic networks including, but not limited to, the Internet, where various information operations occur.²⁶ Information warfare, on the other hand, is narrower than information operations and is defined as “information operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict to achieve or promote Christensen, *Bracing for Guerrilla Warfare in Cyberspace: ‘There are Lots of Opportunities; That’s Very Scary’*, CNN.COM, Apr. 6, 1999, http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/cyberterror/).\n\nspecific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries.”²⁷ Information warfare has been conducted since at least the sixth century BC.²⁸ Even before the rise of cyberspace, warring parties used electronic deception and disruption as essential ingredients of “real war.” For instance, the U.S. Air Force has had information warfare squadrons since the 1980s, which were used successfully during the first Gulf War.²⁹ Information operations is an evolving discipline within many nations’s militaries.\nCyber warfare is simply the latest form of information warfare,³⁰ and can include computer network attacks (CNA), which consist of “operations to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers or computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”³¹ A CNA essentially involves the “hacking” of another nation’s computer network, but uses data systems, as opposed to physical weapons, to execute the attack.³² ## B. Recent Cyber Attacks and the Resulting Damage Cyber attacks that have taken place in the past few years illustrate how states are utilizing modern technology and more forcefully engaging in information warfare to weaken opponents’ critical infrastructures. There is significant international concern that hostile foreign governments could preemptively launch computer-based attacks on integral national or regional systems, such as those supporting energy distribution, telecommunications, 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 309 and financial services.³³ Since everything from transportation to commodity supply to health care to public safety to military operations now relies on computer information systems,³⁴ cyber attacks have the potential to cause far greater damage than conventional weapons.\nRecent publicly-known cyber attacks include attacks on Lithuanian commercial and government websites in June 2008, attacks on Estonian government websites in 2007, an e-mail breach in the Pentagon in June 2007, and hacks into Pakistan’s state-owned telephone company’s website in January 2003.³⁵ Around August 2008, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks temporarily disabled official Georgian websites, including those for the President’s office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Defense, and led to communication problems throughout the country.³⁶ Even more recently, it has been discovered that Chinese hackers have breached the White House computer networks on numerous occasions, obtaining e-mail communication exchanged among government officials.³⁷ Additionally, the damage caused by many of these attacks included injury, death, and property damage. In perhaps the most extreme example, the 2007 attacks on Estonian websites caused more than just confusion for the nation’s population. At the time of these attacks, Estonia had essentially instituted an “e-government” where many aspects of the government were carried Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] out online.³⁸ In addition to bringing down many of Estonia's critical government and commercial websites, the cyber attacks also caused the emergency phone number used for calling ambulances and the fire service to be unavailable for more than one hour.³⁹ As a result, widespread social unrest and rioting left 150 people injured and one Russian national dead.⁴⁰ In contrast, the Lithuanian attacks involved the defacement of government and commercial websites with anti-Lithuanian rhetoric and communist symbols.⁴¹ The government, however, was able to prepare sufficient defenses to these attacks.⁴² These two examples demonstrate that the damage from a cyber attack can often be unpredictable.\n## C. The Methods Used in Carrying Out a Cyber Attack Cyber weapons are not like traditional weapons of warfare. Individuals or nations that use cyber weapons may choose from a variety of options, including syntactic, semantic, and mixed weapons.⁴³ Syntactic weapons, which target a computer's operating system, include malicious code, such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, DDoS, and spyware.⁴⁴ Through DDoS attacks, like those used against Georgia, the cyber attacker shuts down a website by bombarding it with large amounts of traffic.⁴⁵ Conversely, semantic weapons target\"the accuracy of information to which the computer user has access.\"⁴⁶ In other words, a semantic attack consists of altering information that enters the computer's system 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 311 in order to produce errors without the user’s knowledge.⁴⁷ Mixed or blended weapons combine syntactic and semantic weapons to attack both information and the computer’s operating system, resulting in a more sophisticated attack.⁴⁸ An example of a mixed weapon is a “bot network,” which is a proliferation of “bots,” surreptitiously planted on innocent third-party computers. Bots are remote-controlled computer programs that infect other computers. A hacker who controls the bots can spy, copy, and transmit sensitive data, as well as organize the bots in a swarm attack against targeted computers.⁴⁹ Attacked computers or networks are systems that have been infected with malicious software through the use of these weapons, and that are then brought under the control of an attacker in a remote location.⁵⁰ Infected devices continually listen for commands from the attacker and act upon them, with the intention of compromising the opponent’s security or critical infrastructure.⁵¹ The Internet was originally a network of computers linked to the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s and 1970s.⁵² As the computer networks of universities and private research facilities merged through the development of hypertext, a global network with benefits to both military and civilian sectors was created.⁵³ The new technology, however, has also created vulnerabilities for nations that rely heavily on the Internet, especially in their military and governmental infrastructures.⁵⁴ This has created an opportunity for warring parties to exploit network vulnerabilities with various cyber weapons and attacks.\n--- Loy.

INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW SHOULD GOVERN THE LEGALITY OF CYBER ATTACKS WHEN SUCH ATTACKS CONSTITUTE ARMED CONFLICT Information gathering and disruption have always been major tools of war. Disrupting an enemy's communications networks may even have greater strategic value than destroying its arsenals or supply lines. Indeed, some information warfare methods are considered so unsavory as to be prohibited by the laws of war.\nWhile a cyber attack is not truly kinetic or physical in nature like traditional forms of weaponry, a cyber attack may still lead to major physical destruction and even death.55 Therefore, because of these possible consequences, a cyber attack could constitute an armed conflict, such that IHL governs, if certain criteria are met. The threshold question is under what circumstances can a cyber attack be deemed an armed conflict, such that IHL applies. This is an important question because its answer provides guidance to nations on how they can respond to such attacks in a way that is consistent with international legal norms.\n## A. International Humanitarian Law Background IHL is the branch of public international law that\"seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering which it causes.\"56 It is one of two principle divisions of the laws of war and is termed jus in bello, or the\"law in war.\"57 The other division is known as jus ad bellum, or the\"law to war,\"which governs the legality of resorting to armed force.58 The terms\"law of war\"and\"law of armed conflict\"are synonymous.\nJus in bello traditionally involves both Geneva and Hague law. Geneva law rests on the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols.59 These treaties are particularly concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict, with Additional Protocol I focusing on the means and methods of warfare. Conversely, Hague law refers to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, and is mainly concerned with methods and means of warfare, tactics, and the general conduct of hostilities. In modern\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\n## B. The Applicability of IHL to Cyber Attacks\nThe law of armed conflict, as a part of international law, is binding on states, yet a violation may also involve the prosecution of individuals for war crimes.⁶¹ Some have argued that IHL cannot govern cyber attacks because there is nothing physical or kinetic about such operations.⁶² In other words, a CNA is not an armed conflict in the true sense of the phrase and, therefore, such an attack falls outside of the scope of IHL. Article 2, which is common to all four of the Geneva Conventions, provides that “[i]n addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”⁶³ Additional Protocol I also relies on this same “armed conflict” language. Article 1(3) of Additional Protocol I states that “[t]his Protocol, which supplements the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims, shall apply in the situations referred to in Article 2 common to those Conventions.”⁶⁴ Thus, in order for IHL to govern a cyber attack, such an attack must in fact constitute an armed conflict.\nNevertheless, commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their subsequent Additional Protocols have posited that “armed conflict” can be viewed in a fairly expansive way.⁶⁵ Armed conflict has been defined as “any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces.”⁶⁶ A\n⁶⁰. *Id.*\n⁶¹.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\ndispute resulting in the engagement of armed forces, however, cannot be the sole criterion. For example, the replacement of border police with soldiers or an accidental border incursion by members of the armed forces would not amount to an armed conflict.67 Thus, some degree of intensity and duration must be considered, as underlying principles of IHL make clear.68 IHL is founded upon the idea that victims of armed conflict, including personnel who have been rendered hors de combat,69 are entitled to protection.70 This protection is “usually framed in terms of injury, death, or in the case of property, damage or destruction.”71 Therefore, fundamental principles of IHL provide that armed conflict occurs when a group takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy,72 thereby narrowing the definition of armed conflict and limiting its applicability.\nFrom the above discussion, it logically follows that a cyber attack may constitute armed conflict, even though the use of a computer as a weapon is not a traditional or physical method of warfare, as long as certain consequences arise. While cyber attacks employ modern technology not conceived of during the drafting of the Geneva Conventions, the language of Additional Protocol I, and in particular Article 36, indicate that the drafters anticipated the application of the rules to new developments in warfare methods.73 The law of armed conflict must change and develop to account for new humanitarian imperatives that may be generated\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nAdditional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides important guidance in assessing the applicability of IHL to cyber attacks. Additional Protocol I codifies many existing principles of CIL and introduces important new treaty provisions relating to international armed conflict.77 Some provisions of Additional Protocol I are controversial such that they are said to only bind state parties to the treaty and, thus, they do not reflect customary law.78 Nevertheless, the significance of Additional Protocol I, as it relates to cyber warfare specifically and jus in bello generally, is that it supplements the original Geneva Conventions as they apply to civilians in an armed conflict as well as to the prohibited methods of warfare in situations of conflict.79 A key aspect of Additional Protocol I is the “doctrine of unnecessary suffering,” which is fundamental to jus in bello in general.80 Article 35 states: “In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.”81 This principle serves to place some limits on the barbarity and the range of means and weapons Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] that are available in today's modern society. Furthermore, Additional Protocol I was the first treaty to set out specifically the principle of proportionality, which requires that the losses resulting from military action should not be excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.⁸² Proportionality closely relates to the concept of indiscriminate attacks. Article 51(5)(b) describes an indiscriminate attack as one that\"may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\"⁸³ These principles are important to cyber warfare because they require that the attacker refrain from attacks that may be expected to cause excessive collateral damage.⁸⁴ Similar to nuclear weapons, cyber weapons are arguably sui generis or, in other words, they are unique in their characteristics and therefore should be governed by a unique set of laws.⁸⁵ Nevertheless, cyber weapons, just like nuclear weapons, are weapons that result in consequences similar to that of traditional weapons. Accordingly, IHL principles, such as the concept of unnecessary suffering and proportionality, still have relevance in the case of a cyber attack. Often, the question simply will be: To what extent do these principles apply? While some uncertainties remain, what is clear from this discussion is that an\"armed conflict\"occurs when an actor takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy, regardless of the weapon used.⁸⁶ Scholars agree that an armed conflict exists and IHL governs once kinetic weapons are used in combination with CNAs.⁸⁷ The question becomes more difficult when computer networks conduct the first or only hostile acts. The key in assessing such conduct, however, is the effects or consequences of the attacks. Based on this framework, IHL applies whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a ⁸².

See APPLICABILITY OF THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS TO COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS, supra note 73, at 2.\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare The reason why a consequence-based approach is necessary in analyzing the application of IHL to cyber attacks is because once armed conflict has commenced, the means by which injury, death, damage, or destruction are produced has no bearing on the legality of that conduct.⁹⁰ Thus, a lone cyber attack is subject to IHL if these particular consequences result.\nArticle 48 of Additional Protocol I mandates that parties to a conflict direct their operations against military objectives.⁹¹ Thus, targeting a military object, such as military air traffic control system, would be permissible. Since it is often the case that a CNA would target not purely military objectives, the next question is whether targeting civilian computer networks or systems are permissible. Based on the language of Article 48, however, the prohibition is not so much on targeting non-military objectives as it is on attacking them through acts of violence.⁹² Consequently, IHL would prohibit cyber attacks directed against non-military objectives that are intended to, or would foreseeably, cause injury, death, destruction, or damage.⁹³ On the other hand, an attack targeting a non-military objective that is not likely to result in the aforementioned consequences would be permissible.⁹⁴ --- ⁸⁸.

THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN CYBER CONFLICT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITIES IN APPLYING IHL TO CYBER ATTACKS\nSince IHL may apply to cyber warfare in certain situations depending on the results of an attack, it is not necessary to create a completely new set of laws or form a new treaty to apply solely to cyber attacks. Nevertheless, applying IHL to the 2008 cyber conflict involving Russia and Georgia illustrates the difficulties in being able to implement fully IHL in these instances and to articulate concretely the reactions to such attacks. The most notable difficulties involve attributing responsibility for the attacks and determining the difference between military objectives and non-military objectives in the context of targeted websites and computer systems.\n### A. Was Russia Responsible for the Attacks on Georgian Websites?\nBoth Russia and Georgia are state parties to Additional Protocol I, which pertains to the protection of victims of international armed conflict.⁹⁵ Thus, as parties to the treaty, its provisions bind them, including the duty before carrying out an attack to “do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are . . . military objectives.”⁹⁶ Even for states not a party to the Protocol, customary law would still require their forces to attack only military objectives, meaning that these targets must be distinguished from civilian objectives.⁹⁷ The Institute of International Law even points out that existing international law prohibits the use of all weapons that, by their nature, affect indiscriminately both military and non-military objectives.⁹⁸\nAdditional Protocol I further requires that in the time of armed conflict, states must ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to counsel military commanders regarding the application of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol\n---\n⁹⁵.

Nevertheless, given the relatively small amount of equipment required to launch a cyber attack and the pervasiveness of the Internet, ascertaining whether Russia, as opposed to non-state actors, was responsible for the attacks on Georgian websites, such that legal implications are created, is extremely difficult. Conversely, actually engaging in cyber war or bombarding a website is relatively simple. As demonstrated by one reporter, all one needs to do is save a copy of a certain Georgian web page to one’s hard drive and then open it on the computer’s browser. Once accessed, the page will load thumb-nailed versions of a dozen key Georgian websites in a single window. All the cyber “soldier” must do is set the page to update automatically every three to five seconds and from then on the browser will continue to send thousands of queries to the most important Georgian websites, helping to overload them and bring them down.⁹⁹ This is the simple way of bringing down a website, but there are more sophisticated and creative options, including obtaining certain kinds of software to carry out DDoS attacks.¹⁰¹\nThe evidence is currently not clear whether Russia was involved in the shutdown of Georgian websites or whether the attacks can be attributed to non-state actors.¹⁰² Jose Nazario, an Internet security specialist, believes that non-state actors likely caused the attacks on Georgian websites, because there is a history of the kind of botnet attacks involved previously attacking commercial or non-political targets.¹⁰³ Cyber attacks are often difficult to trace and it can take several months to reach definitive answers. For example, in 1998 an investigation by U.S. intelligence\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] officials initially linked Iraq to a series of breaches of the Department of Defense computers. The real suspects ended up being two teenagers in Northern California.¹⁰⁴ Project Grey Goose, an open-source initiative launched on August 22, 2008, has examined the Russian-Georgian cyber war and has drawn conclusions regarding the Russian government's involvement in the attacks.¹⁰⁵ The group based its conclusion on data collected from two Russian hacker forums, www.xakep.ru and www.stopgeorgian.ru, along with network log files detailing 29,000 status events indicating the up/down status of 149 Georgian websites.¹⁰⁶ In its Phase I Report issued on October 17, 2008, Project Grey Goose concluded that\"the Russian government will likely continue its practice of distancing itself from the Russian nationalistic hacker community thus gaining deniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their actions.\"¹⁰⁷ The group was unable to find any direct link to Russian state organizations guiding the attacks, but maintained that there is significant historical evidence that Russian officials endorse cyber warfare initiated by their country's hacker community.¹⁰⁸ For example, General Vladislav Sherstyuk, the current Russian Federation Security Council Deputy Secretary and former Deputy Director of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information, stated in 2002 that\"strike-capable military computer viruses\"would be used in the cyber battlefield.¹⁰⁹ Furthermore, a letter from a Russian Duma member stated in March 2006:\"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers, that is hackers.\"¹¹⁰ As Project Grey Goose noted, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is no connection between Russian hackers and the 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 321 Russian government. There has been consistent support from members of the Russian government and essentially an implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hackers’ attacks.¹¹¹ If indeed the Russian government or persons acting on behalf of the Russian government were responsible for the attacks on Georgian sites, then the only question as to the applicability of IHL would be whether such attacks resulted in death, damage, destruction, or injury.\nBesides the possibility of ordinary Russian citizens being responsible for the attacks, analysts have also accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a network of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and government, of the Georgian attacks.¹¹² Visits to Georgian government websites seemingly were re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey where the traffic was blocked. According to experts, these servers are widely known to be under the control of the RBN and influenced by the Russian government.¹¹³ If the RBN were acting on behalf of the Russian government, then this would constitute conduct by a state.¹¹⁴ If the actors were civilians, the problem in applying IHL becomes more complex. Even civilians or non-state actors who attempt to neutralize an enemy network, via a CNA that results in the aforementioned consequences, could be considered as direct participants in hostilities for purposes of Geneva law.¹¹⁵ This would mean that these civilians are illegal combatants and, therefore, not immune from retaliatory attack.¹¹⁶ Civilians could also be subject --- Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. [Vol. 32:303] to criminal prosecution under domestic law for the mere fact of taking part in hostilities.¹¹⁷ If the actors who carried out the cyber attacks against Georgia were members of Russia's armed forces, such personnel would have all the rights and liabilities of combatants. They could be attacked in retaliation like any other military personnel and could be able to achieve prisoner of war status. Again, the situation becomes more problematic when the technicians that act for the nation or military are not incorporated into the armed forces, but rather are simply computer-savvy civilians.¹¹⁸ ## B. Defining Military Objectives As mentioned above, in the context of military operations, only military objectives may be directly attacked. The definition of military objectives as provided in Additional Protocol I may be considered a part of CIL. Under Article 52(2) of the Protocol,\"military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\"¹¹⁹ Military equipment and their facilities, other than medical and religious structures, are clearly military objectives and, therefore, subject to direct cyber attacks.¹²⁰ The problem arises, however, when dual-use objects, objects that serve both military and civilian purposes such as airports and bridges, are targeted. The source of the dilemma in clearly defining military objectives versus non-military objectives is in interpreting the terms found in Article 52 of Additional Protocol I.¹²¹ Commentaries to the Protocol seem to define military objectives more narrowly, stating that they are objects\"directly used by the armed forces,\"locations\"of special importance for military operations,\"and objects intended for use or being used --- ¹¹⁷.

See Wired Warfare, supra note 27, at 380, 384-85.\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 323 for military purposes.¹²² In contrast, nations like the United States take a more expansive approach by including economic targets as military objectives.¹²³ Essentially, once the determination is made whether a cyber attack caused injury, death, damage or destruction, opinions will likely differ on whether the intended target was a civilian or military object. Chances are that if the attack results in none of the aforementioned consequences, the fact that a civilian object was targeted will probably be of little concern. This again underscores why the results of a cyber attack are central to the legal analysis.\n## C. The Attacks on Georgian Websites Likely Do Not Amount to an Instance of Armed Conflict, Such That IHL Governs Assuming that Russia was responsible for the cyber attacks on Georgia, the next question must be whether IHL governs this conflict. While the cyber attacks on Georgia appeared to eventually be part of a classic conflict in which the Russian military later invaded Georgia, the cyber conflict itself did not result in the kinds of consequences necessary to rise to the level of an armed conflict. As previously mentioned, during the cyber conflict, major Georgian servers were brought down, resulting in confusion throughout the country and hindering communication.¹²⁴ An argument could be made, perhaps, that damage or destruction was done to Georgian property, even if death or injury did not occur. Nevertheless, because it appears that the main results of the Georgian attacks were confusion and inconvenience, the attacks were thus permissible, regardless of whether the targets were deemed military or non-military objectives.¹²⁵ Even so, cyber attacks that result in confusion, miscommunication, or the temporary shutdown of networks are serious problems, and can be harmful to countries that rely heavily on the Internet. Furthermore, it is entirely possible for the shutdown of a nation’s major websites to lead to far greater consequences.\nBecause investigators in one country do not ordinarily have the authority to cross international borders, the investigation into Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] the source of a cyber attack is often difficult. Law enforcement or national security personnel cannot unilaterally pursue investigations into networks located in other countries.¹²⁶ Just as it is difficult to determine who conducted a cyber attack, it is equally difficult to determine what a permissible retaliatory response to this kind of attack is, especially when the attack inflicts minimal damage. In the absence of death or widespread destruction, whether the international community would consider a conventional military attack a proportionate response is questionable.¹²⁷ For example, although the United States recognizes that initial patterns of attack or infiltration can rise to the level of an armed attack, it takes the position that reprisals involving armed conflict or the use of force are illegal. The United States thus justifies a responsive use of force in the exercise of the right of self-defense.¹²⁸ Some also argue that cyber attacks require an expansion of the definition of the use of force, such that there would be greater permissible responses through self-defense.¹²⁹ But expanding the definition in order to create greater conflict is not necessary and does not serve any legitimate purpose, particularly when the initial attack does not result in widespread destruction or loss of life. Moreover, legal developments in this area should move in the direction of narrowing the permissible causes for armed conflict, not enlarging them.\nThe 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict provides a good example of how the many uncertainties and novelties of cyber warfare make the application of IHL difficult in certain instances. It is especially hard when determining responsibility for attacks or clearly defining the distinction between military and non-military objectives. An analysis of the Georgian attacks is meant to highlight the types of issues that arise when applying IHL to such conduct. This does not mean that IHL is not the proper regime to 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 325 deal with cyber attacks in the future.¹³⁰ Rather, it underscores the continued work that must be done by the international community in the upcoming years to more clearly define certain terms and to set forth more transparent policies. What is clear, however, is that cyber attacks should only be undertaken in a way that respects international law principles.\n## V. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND POWERFUL STATES MUST SET FORTH MORE EXPLICIT AND TRANSPARENT POLICIES REGARDING CYBER WARFARE ISSUES IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING IHL PRINCIPLES Existing principles governing the law of war need not be abandoned in the era of modern warfare. Rather, existing rules and mechanisms simply need to be applied in novel ways and old tenets of warfare must be rethought. The challenges, as well as the opportunities, of cyber warfare need to be better understood, and its laws and procedures need to be updated to accommodate the changes in global technology. Over the past few years, some states and international organizations have devoted considerable effort to devise and implement preventative measures aimed at ensuring better compliance with IHL in the event of a cyber attack.¹³¹ Expert seminars have been assembled to discuss various ideas and proposals, particularly through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).¹³² Many participants have acknowledged a positive obligation on states not involved in an armed conflict to take action against states that are violating IHL, particularly by using their influences to stop the violations.¹³³ Some argue that a new international accord or treaty must be created in order to deal specifically with cyber warfare.¹³⁴ The rationale is that the Internet takes advantage of legal loopholes where state and non-state actors can ignore traditional Western notions of war as described by IHL and, therefore, more international laws are needed to apply directly to cyberspace.¹³⁵ --- ¹³⁰. *Contra*.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] International treaties, however, would not offer any real alternative to developing and continuing the dialogue among nations, and would likely complicate the issues at stake.¹³⁶ While technological improvements and transparent policies can help nations deal with the attribution problem, there still must be greater discourse regarding cyber warfare issues in order to clear up existing ambiguities.¹³⁷ Cyber warfare, if properly limited, may allow militaries to act on an expanded list of targets while also avoiding the loss of civilian lives.¹³⁸ In other words, cyber warfare could play an important niche role, by supplementing or amplifying more traditional forms of warfare.\nInternational organizations and states should continue their open dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues and should strive for transparency in their policies, such that there are clear international guidelines for how states can permissibly use computers to carry out attacks either independently or part and parcel of a traditional armed conflict. The international legal community must extend the existing IHL framework to apply to cyber warfare, and states must evolve new norms in the form of custom or codification based on experience.¹³⁹ ## A. The Role of International Organizations The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a specialized intergovernmental organization with state members and private organizational members.¹⁴⁰ Founded in 1865, it is now a constituent part of the UN. While the ITU's main purpose is adopting international regulations governing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, the organization's agenda also includes developing a global information infrastructure.¹⁴¹ In developing standards for online security and digital certificates, the ITU could also attempt to establish standards dealing with cyber attacks and information warfare. Regulations promulgated under the ITU\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nThe European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was created in 2004 as a response to concerns about cyber security throughout the European Union.¹⁴⁶ Most of the efforts by the European Commission have resulted in creating technical standards specifically with regard to Internet governance, as opposed to supplementing international law norms. ENISA has, however, recognized the complexity of the technological environment and the threat posed by cyber attacks against electronic communications networks on the availability and integrity of the information accessed through these networks, creating a high-risk situation.¹⁴⁷ Similarly, an Asian regional forum, the Telecommunications and Information Working Group of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, has also promoted regional cooperation in fighting cyber attacks and terrorist misuse of cyber Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] space.¹⁴⁸ Other Asian countries are also looking to bolster cyber defenses. The Malaysian government supported the establishment of the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism, or IMPACT, in May 2008.¹⁴⁹ IMPACT is focused mostly on the “‘upper end of cyber threats’” or attacks that would damage a nation’s critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control.¹⁵⁰ It is clear that individual nations or governments cannot address cyber warfare issues alone; international cooperation is required.¹⁵¹ The aforementioned organizations recognize the difficulties in applying IHL principles to cyber attacks, but are working to establish clearer policies on which nations can rely.\nAs mentioned earlier, a major concern is the ability to attribute a cyber attack to a particular government entity because, although an IP address can be tracked, it does not necessarily mean that a military or government official is behind the keyboard. In the near future, however, Internet anonymity may be lessened, thus making it easier to trace the source of cyber attacks.¹⁵² The UN National Security Agency has been participating in the “IP Traceback” drafting group since the fall of 2008. But this proposal has raised concerns among a number of international organizations. While the upshot of this may be that governments will be able to more effectively track cyber attacks to the source, it is also likely that this type of capability could be misused.¹⁵³ Some people believe that traceback mechanisms will no longer serve much of a purpose because there are too many sources in a DDoS attack to be useful, and the source computer was, in many cases, hacked in the first place.¹⁵⁴ While the UN has no power to impose Internet standards on the world,¹⁵⁵ it has been lobbying for more influence over the way 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 329 the Internet is managed, most prominently through the World Summit on the Information Society.¹⁵⁶ Still, it is unlikely that any sort of mandatory IP Traceback or authentication regime will or could be imposed by national governments or international bodies. While international organizations should continue to advocate transparent policies on cyber warfare in order to assist states, resorting to over-management of the Internet is not the right solution.\n## B. States Should Develop Clearly Defined Cyber Strategies and Comprehensive Government-Network Defenses The conduct and practices of states are itself a major source of CIL and would assist in supplementing conventional norms regarding the law of war and its application to cyber warfare. Particularly, China and the United States serve as examples of states working to establish strong national policies on cyber attacks.\nThe Chinese military and nationally supported groups have prepared detailed plans regarding cyber attacks as a way to achieve electronic dominance.¹⁵⁷ China’s ambitions extend to crippling an enemy’s financial, military, and communications capabilities early in conflict, and there is evidence to indicate that China regards offensive computer operations as essential to taking control in the first stages of war.¹⁵⁸ Furthermore, China has developed viruses to attack enemy computers and has even recently hacked into the White House computer network.¹⁵⁹ While these plans may raise numerous concerns for other nations, China’s push to make cyber warfare an integral part of their national army is prudent. The sooner states embrace the concept of cyber warfare, the sooner IHL ambiguities can be resolved.\nEngineering standards are set by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), both of which are voluntary industry organizations. These private agencies have no regulatory power per se, but set standards that de facto control the Internet. WORKING GROUP ON INTERNET GOVERNANCE, BACKGROUND REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON INTERNET GOVERNANCE (2005), available at http://www.wgig.org/docs/BackgroundReport.pdf.\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] Because cyber attacks are not going to disappear, it is better that states establish clear national policies, such that the rest of the international community can follow suit.\nThe United States has become increasingly concerned about the threats of cyber attacks. In recent years, there have been a series of cyber attacks on military and homeland security computer networks in the United States, many of which have been traced back to China.¹⁶⁰ Presumably as a way to deal with these dangers, the United States has developed cyber warfare contingency plans under the National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 16, which was implemented in 2002.¹⁶¹ The directive, however, has remained classified and, therefore, does little to deter potential enemies. Nevertheless, this directive apparently ordered the development of guidelines to regulate the use of cyber weapons in war. Additionally, NSPD 16 instituted strict rules of engagement requiring “top-level” approval for any such attack.¹⁶² Some people in the United States believe that the nation needs to do more to develop an offensive cyber war capability, similar to that of China.¹⁶³ In all reality, nations will probably not be able to develop a complete military offensive until there is further clarity in determining the attribution of attacks. Furthermore, the lines separating crime, terrorism, and warfare are often hard to draw.¹⁶⁴ Nevertheless, the United States is taking action by attempting to develop and sustain a cyber-force with personnel trained in conducting cyber warfare.¹⁶⁵ More nations should seek to develop transparent standards regarding cyber attacks so that the law can continue to develop and nations can better understand how respond to such attacks.\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 331 ## C. The Future of Cyber Warfare: The Cyber Defense Era The near future of cyber warfare will likely resemble that of nuclear defense, in which the growing trend will be for nations to set up cyber defense systems as a way to deter cyber attacks by other nations. Recently, seven NATO countries backed the establishment of a new cyber warfare defense center in Estonia.¹⁶⁶ The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) began operations in the Fall of 2008, and conducts research and training in cyber warfare.¹⁶⁷ A large portion of the CCDCOE’s staff are specialists from the sponsoring countries, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Spain, and the United States has agreed to send an observer.¹⁶⁸ In June 2009, the CCDCOE held a Conference on Cyber Warfare to discuss definitions of cyber warfare and the enhancement of cyber defense capabilities.¹⁶⁹ In the near future, there will likely be greater adoption of counter-strategies by states in order to deflect radicalization that is used for inciting violence or attacking enemy infrastructures over the Internet. These strategies might include open-source intelligence gathering and infiltration efforts.¹⁷⁰ In addition, nations may also seek to take advantage of opportunities to use offensive information operations to achieve specific outcomes, including operations to undermine group cohesion and to interfere with decision-making, or to constrain terrorist activities in order to preempt attacks.¹⁷¹ The reason for this is that reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful cyber attacks.¹⁷² Thus, more effective defense measures should incorporate predictive, active, and preemptive elements.¹⁷³ The United States, through the Department of Defense (DOD), has also created a program known as Computer Network --- ¹⁶⁶.

Additionally, more nations will likely follow the United States’ lead by creating these kinds of defense mechanisms in the near future.\n## VI. CONCLUSION Cyberspace has been in existence for a number of years, but government entities are increasingly taking advantage of this domain as a way to carry out various kinds of war-like attacks with the help of computers. This raises many concerns, given that major aspects of a nation’s critical or physical infrastructure are connected to cyberspace.¹⁷⁷ This article has shown that international laws that are currently in place do address the ever-changing nature of warfare. The Geneva Conventions, as well as the IHL principles of proportionality and unnecessary suffering, all provide a framework for addressing cyber warfare issues. The international legal community, however, must continue to work to address certain ambiguities that exist in applying IHL so that nations have a clear understanding as to how to go about carrying out or defending against a cyber attack. The key for states and international organizations in the upcoming years is to find better, more efficient ways to determine who is responsible for particular cyber attacks and to establish more transparent national policies regarding evolving cyber warfare issues. Although cyber attacks are usually not immediately directed at human beings, they do have the potential to indirectly cause severe injuries or even 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 333 death.¹⁷⁸ The effects of a cyber attack will determine whether it is classified as an armed conflict for purposes of IHL. Additionally, the outcome of the attack will drive the victim-nation’s response.\nScience fiction literature and film are replete with future wars in which enemy nations or worlds disrupt civilian and military communications networks as a way to gain military and economic control.¹⁷⁹ Except that this is no longer science fiction. As early as 2001, it was recognized by the international community that cyber warfare would be a major threat in the future.¹⁸⁰ As expected, there are competing theories for how to best handle these changes in war tactics. Some advocate that a nation’s military should actually create a “Cyber Force” that focuses entirely on cyber attacks.¹⁸¹ Others argue that cyber attacks only produce a limited breadth of damage and, therefore, are not a major threat such that there should be international legal concerns.¹⁸² Nevertheless, the unpredictable consequences and unexpected adversarial advantages that stem from a cyber attack can be just as destructive and damaging as a physical attack. Accordingly, states and international organizations must take proactive stances toward establishing national cyber security strategies and adhering to international legal norms, with the recognition that cyber warfare is here to stay.\n--- ¹⁷⁸.

INTRODUCTION In early August 2008, a full-scale war broke out between Russia and Georgia over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a pro-Russian autonomous region of Georgia.¹ Bombs were dropped throughout the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, with Russian bombers targeting Georgia’s economic infrastructure, including the country’s largest Black Sea port, Poti, and the main road connecting the southern part of Georgia with the East.² In the two months leading up to this conflict, Georgia’s Internet infrastructure was also attacked and major Georgian website servers were brought down, hindering communication and causing confusion throughout the country.³ The kind of attacks used is known as distributed denial of service attacks.⁴ They are triggered * Senior Production Editor, Loyola of Los Angeles International &amp; Comparative Law Review (ILR), Volume 32; J.D., Loyola Law School, 2010; B.A., University of Southern California, 2007. I am grateful for the helpful comments and critiques of Professor Karl Manheim and the students of ILR. Most importantly, I want to thank my parents, my brother and sister, and Alex for their constant encouragement, support, and love.\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] when computers in a network are simultaneously ordered to bombard a website with millions of requests, which then overload the website server and cause it to shut down.⁵ These cyber attacks mainly hindered the Georgian government's ability to communicate with its citizens, as well as other nations, both before and during the physical invasion by Russia.⁶ Official Georgian websites, including those for the President's office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Defense were disabled, at least temporarily.⁷ Even after a cease-fire between the nations was ordered shortly after the physical invasion by Russia, major Georgian servers remained inoperable.⁸ The Russian-Georgian cyber conflict, which was perhaps the first time that cyber attacks were used alongside conventional military action,⁹ illustrates the havoc that can spread on the digital battlefield and re-energizes the debate over whether the laws of war apply to this new kind of warfare.\nWhether the world is prepared or not, cyber weapons are becoming a staple of modern war. Combat no longer consists solely of physical attacks or invasions among nations with distinct military units. This new kind of warfare uses a target nation's own technology against it, in order to bring down vital infrastructure.¹⁰ As Internet and computer technology continues to develop, so too will the methods and means of warfare. Moreover, given the low cost and wide availability of computers, as well as the ability to operate them anonymously, cyber attacks make for an attractive method of warfare.¹¹ In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks, both by nations and by non-state actors.¹²\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nCurrently, there is no provision in international humanitarian law (IHL)¹⁶ or customary international law (CIL)¹⁷ that explicitly outlaws cyber warfare or computer network attacks, either carried out independently or during times of war. This is understandable since the law of war dates back to the nineteenth century and has not yet been updated for applicability in the Information Age.¹⁸ Nonetheless, some legal restraints do apply.\nThis article argues that existing IHL principles should be used to analyze the legality of cyber attacks. Part II of this article discusses the increasing use of cyber warfare in international conflict. Part III of this article explains that IHL principles apply whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a state, are more than simply sporadic in nature and are intended to cause, or will foreseeably cause, injury, death, damage, or destruction. On the other hand, IHL most likely does not apply in the absence of those Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] consequences. Part IV applies IHL principles to the 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict. Given the complexities and novelties involved in this new kind of warfare, however, Part V further proposes that the international community and powerful states should seek to supplement existing IHL principles with more explicit and transparent policies that best correspond to modern Internet technology and address the ways in which this technology can legally be used to carry out cyber attacks.\nIn sum, this article addresses the use of cyber or computer network attacks and considers how jus in bello, or the body of law concerned with what is permissible during hostilities, governs such conflict.¹⁹ This article ultimately seeks to answer the question: “Does a cyber attack constitute an act of war such that international humanitarian law principles apply and govern its use?”\n## II. RECENT CYBER ATTACKS ILLUSTRATE HOW STATES ARE MORE FORCEFULLY ENGAGING IN CYBER WARFARE AS A MEANS TO WEAKEN OPPONENTS’ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES The Internet has emerged as a powerful tool for government functions, information, and mobilization, as well as commerce and social networking.²⁰ It has even become a way to disseminate ideological and political messages.²¹ With the increase in utilization of the Internet for more than just economic and social functions, the international community must be aware that it can also serve as a tool for conducting operations that lead to confusion, destruction, and even death. Examples of cyber attacks against nations in recent history underscore the potential implications in using the Internet as a weapon in war, as well as how there is now clear international recognition of cyberspace as a battlefield. This is evidenced by the fact that information warfare systems are currently being developed and used by at least 120 countries, including Peru, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Croatia, Vietnam, and Russia.²² In order to fully understand cyber attacks and their 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 307 implications, one must first define cyber warfare and its related concepts.\n## A. What is Cyber Warfare?\nThe U.S. Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”²³ Such harm could be inflicted on the computer network, as well as to physical facilities and persons. Cyber attacks are distinct from cyber crimes, which are governed by national criminal statutes and include such acts as identity theft and Internet fraud.²⁴ Cyber attacks, unlike cyber crimes, involve “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”²⁵ In order to fully comprehend what is meant by cyber warfare, the concept of “cyberspace” should also be explored. Essentially, cyberspace is the sum of electronic networks including, but not limited to, the Internet, where various information operations occur.²⁶ Information warfare, on the other hand, is narrower than information operations and is defined as “information operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict to achieve or promote Christensen, *Bracing for Guerrilla Warfare in Cyberspace: ‘There are Lots of Opportunities; That’s Very Scary’*, CNN.COM, Apr. 6, 1999, http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/cyberterror/).\n\nspecific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries.”²⁷ Information warfare has been conducted since at least the sixth century BC.²⁸ Even before the rise of cyberspace, warring parties used electronic deception and disruption as essential ingredients of “real war.” For instance, the U.S. Air Force has had information warfare squadrons since the 1980s, which were used successfully during the first Gulf War.²⁹ Information operations is an evolving discipline within many nations’s militaries.\nCyber warfare is simply the latest form of information warfare,³⁰ and can include computer network attacks (CNA), which consist of “operations to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers or computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”³¹ A CNA essentially involves the “hacking” of another nation’s computer network, but uses data systems, as opposed to physical weapons, to execute the attack.³² ## B. Recent Cyber Attacks and the Resulting Damage Cyber attacks that have taken place in the past few years illustrate how states are utilizing modern technology and more forcefully engaging in information warfare to weaken opponents’ critical infrastructures. There is significant international concern that hostile foreign governments could preemptively launch computer-based attacks on integral national or regional systems, such as those supporting energy distribution, telecommunications, 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 309 and financial services.³³ Since everything from transportation to commodity supply to health care to public safety to military operations now relies on computer information systems,³⁴ cyber attacks have the potential to cause far greater damage than conventional weapons.\nRecent publicly-known cyber attacks include attacks on Lithuanian commercial and government websites in June 2008, attacks on Estonian government websites in 2007, an e-mail breach in the Pentagon in June 2007, and hacks into Pakistan’s state-owned telephone company’s website in January 2003.³⁵ Around August 2008, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks temporarily disabled official Georgian websites, including those for the President’s office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Defense, and led to communication problems throughout the country.³⁶ Even more recently, it has been discovered that Chinese hackers have breached the White House computer networks on numerous occasions, obtaining e-mail communication exchanged among government officials.³⁷ Additionally, the damage caused by many of these attacks included injury, death, and property damage. In perhaps the most extreme example, the 2007 attacks on Estonian websites caused more than just confusion for the nation’s population. At the time of these attacks, Estonia had essentially instituted an “e-government” where many aspects of the government were carried Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] out online.³⁸ In addition to bringing down many of Estonia's critical government and commercial websites, the cyber attacks also caused the emergency phone number used for calling ambulances and the fire service to be unavailable for more than one hour.³⁹ As a result, widespread social unrest and rioting left 150 people injured and one Russian national dead.⁴⁰ In contrast, the Lithuanian attacks involved the defacement of government and commercial websites with anti-Lithuanian rhetoric and communist symbols.⁴¹ The government, however, was able to prepare sufficient defenses to these attacks.⁴² These two examples demonstrate that the damage from a cyber attack can often be unpredictable.\n## C. The Methods Used in Carrying Out a Cyber Attack Cyber weapons are not like traditional weapons of warfare. Individuals or nations that use cyber weapons may choose from a variety of options, including syntactic, semantic, and mixed weapons.⁴³ Syntactic weapons, which target a computer's operating system, include malicious code, such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, DDoS, and spyware.⁴⁴ Through DDoS attacks, like those used against Georgia, the cyber attacker shuts down a website by bombarding it with large amounts of traffic.⁴⁵ Conversely, semantic weapons target\"the accuracy of information to which the computer user has access.\"⁴⁶ In other words, a semantic attack consists of altering information that enters the computer's system 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 311 in order to produce errors without the user’s knowledge.⁴⁷ Mixed or blended weapons combine syntactic and semantic weapons to attack both information and the computer’s operating system, resulting in a more sophisticated attack.⁴⁸ An example of a mixed weapon is a “bot network,” which is a proliferation of “bots,” surreptitiously planted on innocent third-party computers. Bots are remote-controlled computer programs that infect other computers. A hacker who controls the bots can spy, copy, and transmit sensitive data, as well as organize the bots in a swarm attack against targeted computers.⁴⁹ Attacked computers or networks are systems that have been infected with malicious software through the use of these weapons, and that are then brought under the control of an attacker in a remote location.⁵⁰ Infected devices continually listen for commands from the attacker and act upon them, with the intention of compromising the opponent’s security or critical infrastructure.⁵¹ The Internet was originally a network of computers linked to the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s and 1970s.⁵² As the computer networks of universities and private research facilities merged through the development of hypertext, a global network with benefits to both military and civilian sectors was created.⁵³ The new technology, however, has also created vulnerabilities for nations that rely heavily on the Internet, especially in their military and governmental infrastructures.⁵⁴ This has created an opportunity for warring parties to exploit network vulnerabilities with various cyber weapons and attacks.\n--- Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] ## III. INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW SHOULD GOVERN THE LEGALITY OF CYBER ATTACKS WHEN SUCH ATTACKS CONSTITUTE ARMED CONFLICT Information gathering and disruption have always been major tools of war. Disrupting an enemy's communications networks may even have greater strategic value than destroying its arsenals or supply lines. Indeed, some information warfare methods are considered so unsavory as to be prohibited by the laws of war.\nWhile a cyber attack is not truly kinetic or physical in nature like traditional forms of weaponry, a cyber attack may still lead to major physical destruction and even death.55 Therefore, because of these possible consequences, a cyber attack could constitute an armed conflict, such that IHL governs, if certain criteria are met. The threshold question is under what circumstances can a cyber attack be deemed an armed conflict, such that IHL applies. This is an important question because its answer provides guidance to nations on how they can respond to such attacks in a way that is consistent with international legal norms.\n## A. International Humanitarian Law Background IHL is the branch of public international law that\"seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering which it causes.\"56 It is one of two principle divisions of the laws of war and is termed jus in bello, or the\"law in war.\"57 The other division is known as jus ad bellum, or the\"law to war,\"which governs the legality of resorting to armed force.58 The terms\"law of war\"and\"law of armed conflict\"are synonymous.\nJus in bello traditionally involves both Geneva and Hague law. Geneva law rests on the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols.59 These treaties are particularly concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict, with Additional Protocol I focusing on the means and methods of warfare. Conversely, Hague law refers to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, and is mainly concerned with methods and means of warfare, tactics, and the general conduct of hostilities. In modern\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\n## B. The Applicability of IHL to Cyber Attacks\nThe law of armed conflict, as a part of international law, is binding on states, yet a violation may also involve the prosecution of individuals for war crimes.⁶¹ Some have argued that IHL cannot govern cyber attacks because there is nothing physical or kinetic about such operations.⁶² In other words, a CNA is not an armed conflict in the true sense of the phrase and, therefore, such an attack falls outside of the scope of IHL. Article 2, which is common to all four of the Geneva Conventions, provides that “[i]n addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”⁶³ Additional Protocol I also relies on this same “armed conflict” language. Article 1(3) of Additional Protocol I states that “[t]his Protocol, which supplements the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims, shall apply in the situations referred to in Article 2 common to those Conventions.”⁶⁴ Thus, in order for IHL to govern a cyber attack, such an attack must in fact constitute an armed conflict.\nNevertheless, commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their subsequent Additional Protocols have posited that “armed conflict” can be viewed in a fairly expansive way.⁶⁵ Armed conflict has been defined as “any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces.”⁶⁶ A\n⁶⁰. *Id.*\n⁶¹.

For example, the replacement of border police with soldiers or an accidental border incursion by members of the armed forces would not amount to an armed conflict.67 Thus, some degree of intensity and duration must be considered, as underlying principles of IHL make clear.68 IHL is founded upon the idea that victims of armed conflict, including personnel who have been rendered hors de combat,69 are entitled to protection.70 This protection is “usually framed in terms of injury, death, or in the case of property, damage or destruction.”71 Therefore, fundamental principles of IHL provide that armed conflict occurs when a group takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy,72 thereby narrowing the definition of armed conflict and limiting its applicability.\nFrom the above discussion, it logically follows that a cyber attack may constitute armed conflict, even though the use of a computer as a weapon is not a traditional or physical method of warfare, as long as certain consequences arise. While cyber attacks employ modern technology not conceived of during the drafting of the Geneva Conventions, the language of Additional Protocol I, and in particular Article 36, indicate that the drafters anticipated the application of the rules to new developments in warfare methods.73 The law of armed conflict must change and develop to account for new humanitarian imperatives that may be generated\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nAdditional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides important guidance in assessing the applicability of IHL to cyber attacks. Additional Protocol I codifies many existing principles of CIL and introduces important new treaty provisions relating to international armed conflict.77 Some provisions of Additional Protocol I are controversial such that they are said to only bind state parties to the treaty and, thus, they do not reflect customary law.78 Nevertheless, the significance of Additional Protocol I, as it relates to cyber warfare specifically and jus in bello generally, is that it supplements the original Geneva Conventions as they apply to civilians in an armed conflict as well as to the prohibited methods of warfare in situations of conflict.79 A key aspect of Additional Protocol I is the “doctrine of unnecessary suffering,” which is fundamental to jus in bello in general.80 Article 35 states: “In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.”81 This principle serves to place some limits on the barbarity and the range of means and weapons Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] that are available in today's modern society. Furthermore, Additional Protocol I was the first treaty to set out specifically the principle of proportionality, which requires that the losses resulting from military action should not be excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.⁸² Proportionality closely relates to the concept of indiscriminate attacks. Article 51(5)(b) describes an indiscriminate attack as one that\"may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\"⁸³ These principles are important to cyber warfare because they require that the attacker refrain from attacks that may be expected to cause excessive collateral damage.⁸⁴ Similar to nuclear weapons, cyber weapons are arguably sui generis or, in other words, they are unique in their characteristics and therefore should be governed by a unique set of laws.⁸⁵ Nevertheless, cyber weapons, just like nuclear weapons, are weapons that result in consequences similar to that of traditional weapons. Accordingly, IHL principles, such as the concept of unnecessary suffering and proportionality, still have relevance in the case of a cyber attack. Often, the question simply will be: To what extent do these principles apply? While some uncertainties remain, what is clear from this discussion is that an\"armed conflict\"occurs when an actor takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy, regardless of the weapon used.⁸⁶ Scholars agree that an armed conflict exists and IHL governs once kinetic weapons are used in combination with CNAs.⁸⁷ The question becomes more difficult when computer networks conduct the first or only hostile acts. The key in assessing such conduct, however, is the effects or consequences of the attacks. Based on this framework, IHL applies whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a ⁸².

See APPLICABILITY OF THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS TO COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS, supra note 73, at 2.\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare The reason why a consequence-based approach is necessary in analyzing the application of IHL to cyber attacks is because once armed conflict has commenced, the means by which injury, death, damage, or destruction are produced has no bearing on the legality of that conduct.⁹⁰ Thus, a lone cyber attack is subject to IHL if these particular consequences result.\nArticle 48 of Additional Protocol I mandates that parties to a conflict direct their operations against military objectives.⁹¹ Thus, targeting a military object, such as military air traffic control system, would be permissible. Since it is often the case that a CNA would target not purely military objectives, the next question is whether targeting civilian computer networks or systems are permissible. Based on the language of Article 48, however, the prohibition is not so much on targeting non-military objectives as it is on attacking them through acts of violence.⁹² Consequently, IHL would prohibit cyber attacks directed against non-military objectives that are intended to, or would foreseeably, cause injury, death, destruction, or damage.⁹³ On the other hand, an attack targeting a non-military objective that is not likely to result in the aforementioned consequences would be permissible.⁹⁴ --- ⁸⁸.

THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN CYBER CONFLICT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITIES IN APPLYING IHL TO CYBER ATTACKS\nSince IHL may apply to cyber warfare in certain situations depending on the results of an attack, it is not necessary to create a completely new set of laws or form a new treaty to apply solely to cyber attacks. Nevertheless, applying IHL to the 2008 cyber conflict involving Russia and Georgia illustrates the difficulties in being able to implement fully IHL in these instances and to articulate concretely the reactions to such attacks. The most notable difficulties involve attributing responsibility for the attacks and determining the difference between military objectives and non-military objectives in the context of targeted websites and computer systems.\n### A. Was Russia Responsible for the Attacks on Georgian Websites?\nBoth Russia and Georgia are state parties to Additional Protocol I, which pertains to the protection of victims of international armed conflict.⁹⁵ Thus, as parties to the treaty, its provisions bind them, including the duty before carrying out an attack to “do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are . . . military objectives.”⁹⁶ Even for states not a party to the Protocol, customary law would still require their forces to attack only military objectives, meaning that these targets must be distinguished from civilian objectives.⁹⁷ The Institute of International Law even points out that existing international law prohibits the use of all weapons that, by their nature, affect indiscriminately both military and non-military objectives.⁹⁸\nAdditional Protocol I further requires that in the time of armed conflict, states must ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to counsel military commanders regarding the application of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol\n---\n⁹⁵.

Nevertheless, given the relatively small amount of equipment required to launch a cyber attack and the pervasiveness of the Internet, ascertaining whether Russia, as opposed to non-state actors, was responsible for the attacks on Georgian websites, such that legal implications are created, is extremely difficult. Conversely, actually engaging in cyber war or bombarding a website is relatively simple. As demonstrated by one reporter, all one needs to do is save a copy of a certain Georgian web page to one’s hard drive and then open it on the computer’s browser. Once accessed, the page will load thumb-nailed versions of a dozen key Georgian websites in a single window. All the cyber “soldier” must do is set the page to update automatically every three to five seconds and from then on the browser will continue to send thousands of queries to the most important Georgian websites, helping to overload them and bring them down.⁹⁹ This is the simple way of bringing down a website, but there are more sophisticated and creative options, including obtaining certain kinds of software to carry out DDoS attacks.¹⁰¹\nThe evidence is currently not clear whether Russia was involved in the shutdown of Georgian websites or whether the attacks can be attributed to non-state actors.¹⁰² Jose Nazario, an Internet security specialist, believes that non-state actors likely caused the attacks on Georgian websites, because there is a history of the kind of botnet attacks involved previously attacking commercial or non-political targets.¹⁰³ Cyber attacks are often difficult to trace and it can take several months to reach definitive answers. For example, in 1998 an investigation by U.S. intelligence\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] officials initially linked Iraq to a series of breaches of the Department of Defense computers. The real suspects ended up being two teenagers in Northern California.¹⁰⁴ Project Grey Goose, an open-source initiative launched on August 22, 2008, has examined the Russian-Georgian cyber war and has drawn conclusions regarding the Russian government's involvement in the attacks.¹⁰⁵ The group based its conclusion on data collected from two Russian hacker forums, www.xakep.ru and www.stopgeorgian.ru, along with network log files detailing 29,000 status events indicating the up/down status of 149 Georgian websites.¹⁰⁶ In its Phase I Report issued on October 17, 2008, Project Grey Goose concluded that\"the Russian government will likely continue its practice of distancing itself from the Russian nationalistic hacker community thus gaining deniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their actions.\"¹⁰⁷ The group was unable to find any direct link to Russian state organizations guiding the attacks, but maintained that there is significant historical evidence that Russian officials endorse cyber warfare initiated by their country's hacker community.¹⁰⁸ For example, General Vladislav Sherstyuk, the current Russian Federation Security Council Deputy Secretary and former Deputy Director of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information, stated in 2002 that\"strike-capable military computer viruses\"would be used in the cyber battlefield.¹⁰⁹ Furthermore, a letter from a Russian Duma member stated in March 2006:\"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers, that is hackers.\"¹¹⁰ As Project Grey Goose noted, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is no connection between Russian hackers and the 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 321 Russian government. There has been consistent support from members of the Russian government and essentially an implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hackers’ attacks.¹¹¹ If indeed the Russian government or persons acting on behalf of the Russian government were responsible for the attacks on Georgian sites, then the only question as to the applicability of IHL would be whether such attacks resulted in death, damage, destruction, or injury.\nBesides the possibility of ordinary Russian citizens being responsible for the attacks, analysts have also accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a network of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and government, of the Georgian attacks.¹¹² Visits to Georgian government websites seemingly were re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey where the traffic was blocked. According to experts, these servers are widely known to be under the control of the RBN and influenced by the Russian government.¹¹³ If the RBN were acting on behalf of the Russian government, then this would constitute conduct by a state.¹¹⁴ If the actors were civilians, the problem in applying IHL becomes more complex. Even civilians or non-state actors who attempt to neutralize an enemy network, via a CNA that results in the aforementioned consequences, could be considered as direct participants in hostilities for purposes of Geneva law.¹¹⁵ This would mean that these civilians are illegal combatants and, therefore, not immune from retaliatory attack.¹¹⁶ Civilians could also be subject --- Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. [Vol. 32:303] to criminal prosecution under domestic law for the mere fact of taking part in hostilities.¹¹⁷ If the actors who carried out the cyber attacks against Georgia were members of Russia's armed forces, such personnel would have all the rights and liabilities of combatants. They could be attacked in retaliation like any other military personnel and could be able to achieve prisoner of war status. Again, the situation becomes more problematic when the technicians that act for the nation or military are not incorporated into the armed forces, but rather are simply computer-savvy civilians.¹¹⁸ ## B. Defining Military Objectives As mentioned above, in the context of military operations, only military objectives may be directly attacked. The definition of military objectives as provided in Additional Protocol I may be considered a part of CIL. Under Article 52(2) of the Protocol,\"military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\"¹¹⁹ Military equipment and their facilities, other than medical and religious structures, are clearly military objectives and, therefore, subject to direct cyber attacks.¹²⁰ The problem arises, however, when dual-use objects, objects that serve both military and civilian purposes such as airports and bridges, are targeted. The source of the dilemma in clearly defining military objectives versus non-military objectives is in interpreting the terms found in Article 52 of Additional Protocol I.¹²¹ Commentaries to the Protocol seem to define military objectives more narrowly, stating that they are objects\"directly used by the armed forces,\"locations\"of special importance for military operations,\"and objects intended for use or being used --- ¹¹⁷.

See Wired Warfare, supra note 27, at 380, 384-85.\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 323 for military purposes.¹²² In contrast, nations like the United States take a more expansive approach by including economic targets as military objectives.¹²³ Essentially, once the determination is made whether a cyber attack caused injury, death, damage or destruction, opinions will likely differ on whether the intended target was a civilian or military object. Chances are that if the attack results in none of the aforementioned consequences, the fact that a civilian object was targeted will probably be of little concern. This again underscores why the results of a cyber attack are central to the legal analysis.\n## C. The Attacks on Georgian Websites Likely Do Not Amount to an Instance of Armed Conflict, Such That IHL Governs Assuming that Russia was responsible for the cyber attacks on Georgia, the next question must be whether IHL governs this conflict. While the cyber attacks on Georgia appeared to eventually be part of a classic conflict in which the Russian military later invaded Georgia, the cyber conflict itself did not result in the kinds of consequences necessary to rise to the level of an armed conflict. As previously mentioned, during the cyber conflict, major Georgian servers were brought down, resulting in confusion throughout the country and hindering communication.¹²⁴ An argument could be made, perhaps, that damage or destruction was done to Georgian property, even if death or injury did not occur. Nevertheless, because it appears that the main results of the Georgian attacks were confusion and inconvenience, the attacks were thus permissible, regardless of whether the targets were deemed military or non-military objectives.¹²⁵ Even so, cyber attacks that result in confusion, miscommunication, or the temporary shutdown of networks are serious problems, and can be harmful to countries that rely heavily on the Internet. Furthermore, it is entirely possible for the shutdown of a nation’s major websites to lead to far greater consequences.\nBecause investigators in one country do not ordinarily have the authority to cross international borders, the investigation into Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] the source of a cyber attack is often difficult. Law enforcement or national security personnel cannot unilaterally pursue investigations into networks located in other countries.¹²⁶ Just as it is difficult to determine who conducted a cyber attack, it is equally difficult to determine what a permissible retaliatory response to this kind of attack is, especially when the attack inflicts minimal damage. In the absence of death or widespread destruction, whether the international community would consider a conventional military attack a proportionate response is questionable.¹²⁷ For example, although the United States recognizes that initial patterns of attack or infiltration can rise to the level of an armed attack, it takes the position that reprisals involving armed conflict or the use of force are illegal. The United States thus justifies a responsive use of force in the exercise of the right of self-defense.¹²⁸ Some also argue that cyber attacks require an expansion of the definition of the use of force, such that there would be greater permissible responses through self-defense.¹²⁹ But expanding the definition in order to create greater conflict is not necessary and does not serve any legitimate purpose, particularly when the initial attack does not result in widespread destruction or loss of life. Moreover, legal developments in this area should move in the direction of narrowing the permissible causes for armed conflict, not enlarging them.\nThe 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict provides a good example of how the many uncertainties and novelties of cyber warfare make the application of IHL difficult in certain instances. It is especially hard when determining responsibility for attacks or clearly defining the distinction between military and non-military objectives. An analysis of the Georgian attacks is meant to highlight the types of issues that arise when applying IHL to such conduct. This does not mean that IHL is not the proper regime to 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 325 deal with cyber attacks in the future.¹³⁰ Rather, it underscores the continued work that must be done by the international community in the upcoming years to more clearly define certain terms and to set forth more transparent policies. What is clear, however, is that cyber attacks should only be undertaken in a way that respects international law principles.\n## V. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND POWERFUL STATES MUST SET FORTH MORE EXPLICIT AND TRANSPARENT POLICIES REGARDING CYBER WARFARE ISSUES IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING IHL PRINCIPLES Existing principles governing the law of war need not be abandoned in the era of modern warfare. Rather, existing rules and mechanisms simply need to be applied in novel ways and old tenets of warfare must be rethought. The challenges, as well as the opportunities, of cyber warfare need to be better understood, and its laws and procedures need to be updated to accommodate the changes in global technology. Over the past few years, some states and international organizations have devoted considerable effort to devise and implement preventative measures aimed at ensuring better compliance with IHL in the event of a cyber attack.¹³¹ Expert seminars have been assembled to discuss various ideas and proposals, particularly through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).¹³² Many participants have acknowledged a positive obligation on states not involved in an armed conflict to take action against states that are violating IHL, particularly by using their influences to stop the violations.¹³³ Some argue that a new international accord or treaty must be created in order to deal specifically with cyber warfare.¹³⁴ The rationale is that the Internet takes advantage of legal loopholes where state and non-state actors can ignore traditional Western notions of war as described by IHL and, therefore, more international laws are needed to apply directly to cyberspace.¹³⁵ --- ¹³⁰. *Contra*.

Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] International treaties, however, would not offer any real alternative to developing and continuing the dialogue among nations, and would likely complicate the issues at stake.¹³⁶ While technological improvements and transparent policies can help nations deal with the attribution problem, there still must be greater discourse regarding cyber warfare issues in order to clear up existing ambiguities.¹³⁷ Cyber warfare, if properly limited, may allow militaries to act on an expanded list of targets while also avoiding the loss of civilian lives.¹³⁸ In other words, cyber warfare could play an important niche role, by supplementing or amplifying more traditional forms of warfare.\nInternational organizations and states should continue their open dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues and should strive for transparency in their policies, such that there are clear international guidelines for how states can permissibly use computers to carry out attacks either independently or part and parcel of a traditional armed conflict. The international legal community must extend the existing IHL framework to apply to cyber warfare, and states must evolve new norms in the form of custom or codification based on experience.¹³⁹ ## A. The Role of International Organizations The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a specialized intergovernmental organization with state members and private organizational members.¹⁴⁰ Founded in 1865, it is now a constituent part of the UN. While the ITU's main purpose is adopting international regulations governing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, the organization's agenda also includes developing a global information infrastructure.¹⁴¹ In developing standards for online security and digital certificates, the ITU could also attempt to establish standards dealing with cyber attacks and information warfare. Regulations promulgated under the ITU\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nThe European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was created in 2004 as a response to concerns about cyber security throughout the European Union.¹⁴⁶ Most of the efforts by the European Commission have resulted in creating technical standards specifically with regard to Internet governance, as opposed to supplementing international law norms. ENISA has, however, recognized the complexity of the technological environment and the threat posed by cyber attacks against electronic communications networks on the availability and integrity of the information accessed through these networks, creating a high-risk situation.¹⁴⁷ Similarly, an Asian regional forum, the Telecommunications and Information Working Group of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, has also promoted regional cooperation in fighting cyber attacks and terrorist misuse of cyber Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] space.¹⁴⁸ Other Asian countries are also looking to bolster cyber defenses. The Malaysian government supported the establishment of the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism, or IMPACT, in May 2008.¹⁴⁹ IMPACT is focused mostly on the “‘upper end of cyber threats’” or attacks that would damage a nation’s critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control.¹⁵⁰ It is clear that individual nations or governments cannot address cyber warfare issues alone; international cooperation is required.¹⁵¹ The aforementioned organizations recognize the difficulties in applying IHL principles to cyber attacks, but are working to establish clearer policies on which nations can rely.\nAs mentioned earlier, a major concern is the ability to attribute a cyber attack to a particular government entity because, although an IP address can be tracked, it does not necessarily mean that a military or government official is behind the keyboard. In the near future, however, Internet anonymity may be lessened, thus making it easier to trace the source of cyber attacks.¹⁵² The UN National Security Agency has been participating in the “IP Traceback” drafting group since the fall of 2008. But this proposal has raised concerns among a number of international organizations. While the upshot of this may be that governments will be able to more effectively track cyber attacks to the source, it is also likely that this type of capability could be misused.¹⁵³ Some people believe that traceback mechanisms will no longer serve much of a purpose because there are too many sources in a DDoS attack to be useful, and the source computer was, in many cases, hacked in the first place.¹⁵⁴ While the UN has no power to impose Internet standards on the world,¹⁵⁵ it has been lobbying for more influence over the way 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 329 the Internet is managed, most prominently through the World Summit on the Information Society.¹⁵⁶ Still, it is unlikely that any sort of mandatory IP Traceback or authentication regime will or could be imposed by national governments or international bodies. While international organizations should continue to advocate transparent policies on cyber warfare in order to assist states, resorting to over-management of the Internet is not the right solution.\n## B. States Should Develop Clearly Defined Cyber Strategies and Comprehensive Government-Network Defenses The conduct and practices of states are itself a major source of CIL and would assist in supplementing conventional norms regarding the law of war and its application to cyber warfare. Particularly, China and the United States serve as examples of states working to establish strong national policies on cyber attacks.\nThe Chinese military and nationally supported groups have prepared detailed plans regarding cyber attacks as a way to achieve electronic dominance.¹⁵⁷ China’s ambitions extend to crippling an enemy’s financial, military, and communications capabilities early in conflict, and there is evidence to indicate that China regards offensive computer operations as essential to taking control in the first stages of war.¹⁵⁸ Furthermore, China has developed viruses to attack enemy computers and has even recently hacked into the White House computer network.¹⁵⁹ While these plans may raise numerous concerns for other nations, China’s push to make cyber warfare an integral part of their national army is prudent. The sooner states embrace the concept of cyber warfare, the sooner IHL ambiguities can be resolved.\nEngineering standards are set by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), both of which are voluntary industry organizations. These private agencies have no regulatory power per se, but set standards that de facto control the Internet.

L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] Because cyber attacks are not going to disappear, it is better that states establish clear national policies, such that the rest of the international community can follow suit.\nThe United States has become increasingly concerned about the threats of cyber attacks. In recent years, there have been a series of cyber attacks on military and homeland security computer networks in the United States, many of which have been traced back to China.¹⁶⁰ Presumably as a way to deal with these dangers, the United States has developed cyber warfare contingency plans under the National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 16, which was implemented in 2002.¹⁶¹ The directive, however, has remained classified and, therefore, does little to deter potential enemies. Nevertheless, this directive apparently ordered the development of guidelines to regulate the use of cyber weapons in war. Additionally, NSPD 16 instituted strict rules of engagement requiring “top-level” approval for any such attack.¹⁶² Some people in the United States believe that the nation needs to do more to develop an offensive cyber war capability, similar to that of China.¹⁶³ In all reality, nations will probably not be able to develop a complete military offensive until there is further clarity in determining the attribution of attacks. Furthermore, the lines separating crime, terrorism, and warfare are often hard to draw.¹⁶⁴ Nevertheless, the United States is taking action by attempting to develop and sustain a cyber-force with personnel trained in conducting cyber warfare.¹⁶⁵ More nations should seek to develop transparent standards regarding cyber attacks so that the law can continue to develop and nations can better understand how respond to such attacks.\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 331 ## C. The Future of Cyber Warfare: The Cyber Defense Era The near future of cyber warfare will likely resemble that of nuclear defense, in which the growing trend will be for nations to set up cyber defense systems as a way to deter cyber attacks by other nations. Recently, seven NATO countries backed the establishment of a new cyber warfare defense center in Estonia.¹⁶⁶ The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) began operations in the Fall of 2008, and conducts research and training in cyber warfare.¹⁶⁷ A large portion of the CCDCOE’s staff are specialists from the sponsoring countries, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Spain, and the United States has agreed to send an observer.¹⁶⁸ In June 2009, the CCDCOE held a Conference on Cyber Warfare to discuss definitions of cyber warfare and the enhancement of cyber defense capabilities.¹⁶⁹ In the near future, there will likely be greater adoption of counter-strategies by states in order to deflect radicalization that is used for inciting violence or attacking enemy infrastructures over the Internet. These strategies might include open-source intelligence gathering and infiltration efforts.¹⁷⁰ In addition, nations may also seek to take advantage of opportunities to use offensive information operations to achieve specific outcomes, including operations to undermine group cohesion and to interfere with decision-making, or to constrain terrorist activities in order to preempt attacks.¹⁷¹ The reason for this is that reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful cyber attacks.¹⁷² Thus, more effective defense measures should incorporate predictive, active, and preemptive elements.¹⁷³ The United States, through the Department of Defense (DOD), has also created a program known as Computer Network --- ¹⁶⁶.

Additionally, more nations will likely follow the United States’ lead by creating these kinds of defense mechanisms in the near future.\n## VI. CONCLUSION Cyberspace has been in existence for a number of years, but government entities are increasingly taking advantage of this domain as a way to carry out various kinds of war-like attacks with the help of computers. This raises many concerns, given that major aspects of a nation’s critical or physical infrastructure are connected to cyberspace.¹⁷⁷ This article has shown that international laws that are currently in place do address the ever-changing nature of warfare. The Geneva Conventions, as well as the IHL principles of proportionality and unnecessary suffering, all provide a framework for addressing cyber warfare issues. The international legal community, however, must continue to work to address certain ambiguities that exist in applying IHL so that nations have a clear understanding as to how to go about carrying out or defending against a cyber attack. The key for states and international organizations in the upcoming years is to find better, more efficient ways to determine who is responsible for particular cyber attacks and to establish more transparent national policies regarding evolving cyber warfare issues. Although cyber attacks are usually not immediately directed at human beings, they do have the potential to indirectly cause severe injuries or even 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 333 death.¹⁷⁸ The effects of a cyber attack will determine whether it is classified as an armed conflict for purposes of IHL. Additionally, the outcome of the attack will drive the victim-nation’s response.\nScience fiction literature and film are replete with future wars in which enemy nations or worlds disrupt civilian and military communications networks as a way to gain military and economic control.¹⁷⁹ Except that this is no longer science fiction. As early as 2001, it was recognized by the international community that cyber warfare would be a major threat in the future.¹⁸⁰ As expected, there are competing theories for how to best handle these changes in war tactics. Some advocate that a nation’s military should actually create a “Cyber Force” that focuses entirely on cyber attacks.¹⁸¹ Others argue that cyber attacks only produce a limited breadth of damage and, therefore, are not a major threat such that there should be international legal concerns.¹⁸² Nevertheless, the unpredictable consequences and unexpected adversarial advantages that stem from a cyber attack can be just as destructive and damaging as a physical attack. Accordingly, states and international organizations must take proactive stances toward establishing national cyber security strategies and adhering to international legal norms, with the recognition that cyber warfare is here to stay.\n--- ¹⁷⁸.

INTRODUCTION\nIn early August 2008, a full-scale war broke out between Russia and Georgia over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a pro-Russian autonomous region of Georgia.¹ Bombs were dropped throughout the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, with Russian bombers targeting Georgia’s economic infrastructure, including the country’s largest Black Sea port, Poti, and the main road connecting the southern part of Georgia with the East.² In the two months leading up to this conflict, Georgia’s Internet infrastructure was also attacked and major Georgian website servers were brought down, hindering communication and causing confusion throughout the country.³ The kind of attacks used is known as distributed denial of service attacks.⁴ They are triggered\n* Senior Production Editor, Loyola of Los Angeles International &amp; Comparative Law Review (ILR), Volume 32; J.D., Loyola Law School, 2010; B.A., University of Southern California, 2007.

Combat no longer consists solely of physical attacks or invasions among nations with distinct military units. This new kind of warfare uses a target nation's own technology against it, in order to bring down vital infrastructure.¹⁰ As Internet and computer technology continues to develop, so too will the methods and means of warfare. Moreover, given the low cost and wide availability of computers, as well as the ability to operate them anonymously, cyber attacks make for an attractive method of warfare.¹¹ In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks, both by nations and by non-state actors.¹²\n5.

As described in a recent news article, a survey of the seventy largest Internet operators in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia found that malicious computer attacks were rising sharply and growing more sophisticated.¹³ Additionally, these attacks are being used not only in political conflict, but also in blackmail schemes and for the purpose of malicious mischief.¹⁴ While concerted online attacks have been a threat for years, the Russian-Georgian cyber conflict of 2008 illustrates how states are more forcefully engaging in cyber attacks as a way to weaken opponents' critical infrastructures—systems and assets vital to national security, economic security, and public health and safety.¹⁵\nCurrently, there is no provision in international humanitarian law (IHL)¹⁶ or customary international law (CIL)¹⁷ that explicitly outlaws cyber warfare or computer network attacks, either carried out independently or during times of war. This is understandable since the law of war dates back to the nineteenth century and has not yet been updated for applicability in the Information Age.¹⁸ Nonetheless, some legal restraints do apply.\nThis article argues that existing IHL principles should be used to analyze the legality of cyber attacks. Part II of this article discusses the increasing use of cyber warfare in international conflict. Part III of this article explains that IHL principles apply whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a state, are more than simply sporadic in nature and are intended to cause, or will foreseeably cause, injury, death, damage, or destruction. On the other hand, IHL most likely does not apply in the absence of those\n13.

Given the complexities and novelties involved in this new kind of warfare, however, Part V further proposes that the international community and powerful states should seek to supplement existing IHL principles with more explicit and transparent policies that best correspond to modern Internet technology and address the ways in which this technology can legally be used to carry out cyber attacks.\nIn sum, this article addresses the use of cyber or computer network attacks and considers how jus in bello, or the body of law concerned with what is permissible during hostilities, governs such conflict.¹⁹ This article ultimately seeks to answer the question: “Does a cyber attack constitute an act of war such that international humanitarian law principles apply and govern its use?”\n## II. RECENT CYBER ATTACKS ILLUSTRATE HOW STATES ARE MORE FORCEFULLY ENGAGING IN CYBER WARFARE AS A MEANS TO WEAKEN OPPONENTS’ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES\nThe Internet has emerged as a powerful tool for government functions, information, and mobilization, as well as commerce and social networking.²⁰ It has even become a way to disseminate ideological and political messages.²¹ With the increase in utilization of the Internet for more than just economic and social functions, the international community must be aware that it can also serve as a tool for conducting operations that lead to confusion, destruction, and even death. Examples of cyber attacks against nations in recent history underscore the potential implications in using the Internet as a weapon in war, as well as how there is now clear international recognition of cyberspace as a battlefield. This is evidenced by the fact that information warfare systems are currently being developed and used by at least 120 countries, including Peru, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Croatia, Vietnam, and Russia.²² In order to fully understand cyber attacks and their\n19.

What is Cyber Warfare?\nThe U.S. Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”²³ Such harm could be inflicted on the computer network, as well as to physical facilities and persons. Cyber attacks are distinct from cyber crimes, which are governed by national criminal statutes and include such acts as identity theft and Internet fraud.²⁴ Cyber attacks, unlike cyber crimes, involve “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”²⁵\nIn order to fully comprehend what is meant by cyber warfare, the concept of “cyberspace” should also be explored. Essentially, cyberspace is the sum of electronic networks including, but not limited to, the Internet, where various information operations occur.²⁶\nInformation warfare, on the other hand, is narrower than information operations and is defined as “information operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict to achieve or promote\nChristensen, *Bracing for Guerrilla Warfare in Cyberspace: ‘There are Lots of Opportunities; That’s Very Scary’*, CNN.COM, Apr. 6, 1999, http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/cyberterror/).\n23.

Recent Cyber Attacks and the Resulting Damage\nCyber attacks that have taken place in the past few years illustrate how states are utilizing modern technology and more forcefully engaging in information warfare to weaken opponents’ critical infrastructures. There is significant international concern that hostile foreign governments could preemptively launch computer-based attacks on integral national or regional systems, such as those supporting energy distribution, telecommunications,\n27.

In perhaps the most extreme example, the 2007 attacks on Estonian websites caused more than just confusion for the nation’s population. At the time of these attacks, Estonia had essentially instituted an “e-government” where many aspects of the government were carried\n33.

The Methods Used in Carrying Out a Cyber Attack\nCyber weapons are not like traditional weapons of warfare. Individuals or nations that use cyber weapons may choose from a variety of options, including syntactic, semantic, and mixed weapons.⁴³ Syntactic weapons, which target a computer's operating system, include malicious code, such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, DDoS, and spyware.⁴⁴ Through DDoS attacks, like those used against Georgia, the cyber attacker shuts down a website by bombarding it with large amounts of traffic.⁴⁵ Conversely, semantic weapons target \"the accuracy of information to which the computer user has access.\"⁴⁶ In other words, a semantic attack consists of altering information that enters the computer's system\n38.

Bots are remote-controlled computer programs that infect other computers. A hacker who controls the bots can spy, copy, and transmit sensitive data, as well as organize the bots in a swarm attack against targeted computers.⁴⁹\nAttacked computers or networks are systems that have been infected with malicious software through the use of these weapons, and that are then brought under the control of an attacker in a remote location.⁵⁰ Infected devices continually listen for commands from the attacker and act upon them, with the intention of compromising the opponent’s security or critical infrastructure.⁵¹\nThe Internet was originally a network of computers linked to the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s and 1970s.⁵² As the computer networks of universities and private research facilities merged through the development of hypertext, a global network with benefits to both military and civilian sectors was created.⁵³ The new technology, however, has also created vulnerabilities for nations that rely heavily on the Internet, especially in their military and governmental infrastructures.⁵⁴ This has created an opportunity for warring parties to exploit network vulnerabilities with various cyber weapons and attacks.\n---\n47.

INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW SHOULD GOVERN THE LEGALITY OF CYBER ATTACKS WHEN SUCH ATTACKS CONSTITUTE ARMED CONFLICT\nInformation gathering and disruption have always been major tools of war. Disrupting an enemy's communications networks may even have greater strategic value than destroying its arsenals or supply lines. Indeed, some information warfare methods are considered so unsavory as to be prohibited by the laws of war.\nWhile a cyber attack is not truly kinetic or physical in nature like traditional forms of weaponry, a cyber attack may still lead to major physical destruction and even death.55 Therefore, because of these possible consequences, a cyber attack could constitute an armed conflict, such that IHL governs, if certain criteria are met. The threshold question is under what circumstances can a cyber attack be deemed an armed conflict, such that IHL applies. This is an important question because its answer provides guidance to nations on how they can respond to such attacks in a way that is consistent with international legal norms.\n## A. International Humanitarian Law Background\nIHL is the branch of public international law that \"seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering which it causes.\"56 It is one of two principle divisions of the laws of war and is termed jus in bello, or the \"law in war.\"57 The other division is known as jus ad bellum, or the \"law to war,\" which governs the legality of resorting to armed force.58 The terms \"law of war\" and \"law of armed conflict\" are synonymous.\nJus in bello traditionally involves both Geneva and Hague law. Geneva law rests on the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols.59 These treaties are particularly concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict, with Additional Protocol I focusing on the means and methods of warfare. Conversely, Hague law refers to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, and is mainly concerned with methods and means of warfare, tactics, and the general conduct of hostilities. In modern\n55. See supra Part II.B.\n56. MCCOUBREY, supra note 18, at 1.\n57. Id.\n58. Id.\n59. Id. at 2.\n2010]\nThe Era of Cyber Warfare\n313\nusage, IHL is taken to comprise jus in bello in both its Geneva and Hague dimensions.⁶⁰\n## B. The Applicability of IHL to Cyber Attacks\nThe law of armed conflict, as a part of international law, is binding on states, yet a violation may also involve the prosecution of individuals for war crimes.⁶¹ Some have argued that IHL cannot govern cyber attacks because there is nothing physical or kinetic about such operations.⁶² In other words, a CNA is not an armed conflict in the true sense of the phrase and, therefore, such an attack falls outside of the scope of IHL. Article 2, which is common to all four of the Geneva Conventions, provides that “[i]n addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”⁶³ Additional Protocol I also relies on this same “armed conflict” language. Article 1(3) of Additional Protocol I states that “[t]his Protocol, which supplements the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims, shall apply in the situations referred to in Article 2 common to those Conventions.”⁶⁴ Thus, in order for IHL to govern a cyber attack, such an attack must in fact constitute an armed conflict.\nNevertheless, commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their subsequent Additional Protocols have posited that “armed conflict” can be viewed in a fairly expansive way.⁶⁵ Armed conflict has been defined as “any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces.”⁶⁶ A\n⁶⁰. *Id.*\n⁶¹.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\ndispute resulting in the engagement of armed forces, however, cannot be the sole criterion. For example, the replacement of border police with soldiers or an accidental border incursion by members of the armed forces would not amount to an armed conflict.67 Thus, some degree of intensity and duration must be considered, as underlying principles of IHL make clear.68 IHL is founded upon the idea that victims of armed conflict, including personnel who have been rendered hors de combat,69 are entitled to protection.70 This protection is “usually framed in terms of injury, death, or in the case of property, damage or destruction.”71 Therefore, fundamental principles of IHL provide that armed conflict occurs when a group takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy,72 thereby narrowing the definition of armed conflict and limiting its applicability.\nFrom the above discussion, it logically follows that a cyber attack may constitute armed conflict, even though the use of a computer as a weapon is not a traditional or physical method of warfare, as long as certain consequences arise. While cyber attacks employ modern technology not conceived of during the drafting of the Geneva Conventions, the language of Additional Protocol I, and in particular Article 36, indicate that the drafters anticipated the application of the rules to new developments in warfare methods.73 The law of armed conflict must change and develop to account for new humanitarian imperatives that may be generated\n67.

According to Additional Protocol I, art. 41(1) and (2), a person is hors de combat if “he is in the power of an adverse party; he clearly expresses an intention to surrender; or he has been rendered unconscious or is otherwise incapacitated by wounds or sickness, and therefore is incapable of defending himself . . .” Additional Protocol I, supra note 64, 1125 U.N.T.S. at 22.\n70.

Article 36 provides: “In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party.” Additional Protocol I, supra note 64, 1125 U.N.T.S. at 21.\n2010]\nThe Era of Cyber Warfare\n315\nby the evolution in the conduct of armed conflict itself.74 In fact, IHL anticipates technological change. For example, the “Martens Clause” found in the Preamble to the Hague Convention IV of 1907 “asserts that even in cases not explicitly covered by specific agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of principles of international law derived from established custom, principles of humanity, and from the dictates of public conscience.”75 In other words, attacks should essentially be judged largely by their effects, rather than by how they are employed.76\nAdditional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides important guidance in assessing the applicability of IHL to cyber attacks. Additional Protocol I codifies many existing principles of CIL and introduces important new treaty provisions relating to international armed conflict.77 Some provisions of Additional Protocol I are controversial such that they are said to only bind state parties to the treaty and, thus, they do not reflect customary law.78 Nevertheless, the significance of Additional Protocol I, as it relates to cyber warfare specifically and jus in bello generally, is that it supplements the original Geneva Conventions as they apply to civilians in an armed conflict as well as to the prohibited methods of warfare in situations of conflict.79\nA key aspect of Additional Protocol I is the “doctrine of unnecessary suffering,” which is fundamental to jus in bello in general.80 Article 35 states: “In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.”81 This principle serves to place some limits on the barbarity and the range of means and weapons\n74.

Furthermore, Additional Protocol I was the first treaty to set out specifically the principle of proportionality, which requires that the losses resulting from military action should not be excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.⁸² Proportionality closely relates to the concept of indiscriminate attacks. Article 51(5)(b) describes an indiscriminate attack as one that \"may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\"⁸³ These principles are important to cyber warfare because they require that the attacker refrain from attacks that may be expected to cause excessive collateral damage.⁸⁴\nSimilar to nuclear weapons, cyber weapons are arguably sui generis or, in other words, they are unique in their characteristics and therefore should be governed by a unique set of laws.⁸⁵ Nevertheless, cyber weapons, just like nuclear weapons, are weapons that result in consequences similar to that of traditional weapons. Accordingly, IHL principles, such as the concept of unnecessary suffering and proportionality, still have relevance in the case of a cyber attack. Often, the question simply will be: To what extent do these principles apply? While some uncertainties remain, what is clear from this discussion is that an \"armed conflict\" occurs when an actor takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy, regardless of the weapon used.⁸⁶\nScholars agree that an armed conflict exists and IHL governs once kinetic weapons are used in combination with CNAs.⁸⁷ The question becomes more difficult when computer networks conduct the first or only hostile acts. The key in assessing such conduct, however, is the effects or consequences of the attacks. Based on this framework, IHL applies whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a\n⁸².

On the other hand, IHL would probably not pertain where the actual, foreseeable, or intended consequences do not include injury, death, damage, or destruction.\nThe reason why a consequence-based approach is necessary in analyzing the application of IHL to cyber attacks is because once armed conflict has commenced, the means by which injury, death, damage, or destruction are produced has no bearing on the legality of that conduct.⁹⁰ Thus, a lone cyber attack is subject to IHL if these particular consequences result.\nArticle 48 of Additional Protocol I mandates that parties to a conflict direct their operations against military objectives.⁹¹ Thus, targeting a military object, such as military air traffic control system, would be permissible. Since it is often the case that a CNA would target not purely military objectives, the next question is whether targeting civilian computer networks or systems are permissible. Based on the language of Article 48, however, the prohibition is not so much on targeting non-military objectives as it is on attacking them through acts of violence.⁹² Consequently, IHL would prohibit cyber attacks directed against non-military objectives that are intended to, or would foreseeably, cause injury, death, destruction, or damage.⁹³ On the other hand, an attack targeting a non-military objective that is not likely to result in the aforementioned consequences would be permissible.⁹⁴\n---\n⁸⁸.

THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN CYBER CONFLICT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITIES IN APPLYING IHL TO CYBER ATTACKS\nSince IHL may apply to cyber warfare in certain situations depending on the results of an attack, it is not necessary to create a completely new set of laws or form a new treaty to apply solely to cyber attacks. Nevertheless, applying IHL to the 2008 cyber conflict involving Russia and Georgia illustrates the difficulties in being able to implement fully IHL in these instances and to articulate concretely the reactions to such attacks. The most notable difficulties involve attributing responsibility for the attacks and determining the difference between military objectives and non-military objectives in the context of targeted websites and computer systems.\n### A. Was Russia Responsible for the Attacks on Georgian Websites?\nBoth Russia and Georgia are state parties to Additional Protocol I, which pertains to the protection of victims of international armed conflict.⁹⁵ Thus, as parties to the treaty, its provisions bind them, including the duty before carrying out an attack to “do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are . . . military objectives.”⁹⁶ Even for states not a party to the Protocol, customary law would still require their forces to attack only military objectives, meaning that these targets must be distinguished from civilian objectives.⁹⁷ The Institute of International Law even points out that existing international law prohibits the use of all weapons that, by their nature, affect indiscriminately both military and non-military objectives.⁹⁸\nAdditional Protocol I further requires that in the time of armed conflict, states must ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to counsel military commanders regarding the application of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol\n---\n⁹⁵.

Nevertheless, given the relatively small amount of equipment required to launch a cyber attack and the pervasiveness of the Internet, ascertaining whether Russia, as opposed to non-state actors, was responsible for the attacks on Georgian websites, such that legal implications are created, is extremely difficult. Conversely, actually engaging in cyber war or bombarding a website is relatively simple. As demonstrated by one reporter, all one needs to do is save a copy of a certain Georgian web page to one’s hard drive and then open it on the computer’s browser. Once accessed, the page will load thumb-nailed versions of a dozen key Georgian websites in a single window. All the cyber “soldier” must do is set the page to update automatically every three to five seconds and from then on the browser will continue to send thousands of queries to the most important Georgian websites, helping to overload them and bring them down.⁹⁹ This is the simple way of bringing down a website, but there are more sophisticated and creative options, including obtaining certain kinds of software to carry out DDoS attacks.¹⁰¹\nThe evidence is currently not clear whether Russia was involved in the shutdown of Georgian websites or whether the attacks can be attributed to non-state actors.¹⁰² Jose Nazario, an Internet security specialist, believes that non-state actors likely caused the attacks on Georgian websites, because there is a history of the kind of botnet attacks involved previously attacking commercial or non-political targets.¹⁰³ Cyber attacks are often difficult to trace and it can take several months to reach definitive answers.

There has been consistent support from members of the Russian government and essentially an implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hackers’ attacks.¹¹¹ If indeed the Russian government or persons acting on behalf of the Russian government were responsible for the attacks on Georgian sites, then the only question as to the applicability of IHL would be whether such attacks resulted in death, damage, destruction, or injury.\nBesides the possibility of ordinary Russian citizens being responsible for the attacks, analysts have also accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a network of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and government, of the Georgian attacks.¹¹² Visits to Georgian government websites seemingly were re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey where the traffic was blocked. According to experts, these servers are widely known to be under the control of the RBN and influenced by the Russian government.¹¹³ If the RBN were acting on behalf of the Russian government, then this would constitute conduct by a state.¹¹⁴\nIf the actors were civilians, the problem in applying IHL becomes more complex. Even civilians or non-state actors who attempt to neutralize an enemy network, via a CNA that results in the aforementioned consequences, could be considered as direct participants in hostilities for purposes of Geneva law.¹¹⁵ This would mean that these civilians are illegal combatants and, therefore, not immune from retaliatory attack.¹¹⁶ Civilians could also be subject\n---\n111. *Id.* at 8.

They could be attacked in retaliation like any other military personnel and could be able to achieve prisoner of war status. Again, the situation becomes more problematic when the technicians that act for the nation or military are not incorporated into the armed forces, but rather are simply computer-savvy civilians.¹¹⁸\n## B. Defining Military Objectives\nAs mentioned above, in the context of military operations, only military objectives may be directly attacked. The definition of military objectives as provided in Additional Protocol I may be considered a part of CIL. Under Article 52(2) of the Protocol, \"military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\"¹¹⁹ Military equipment and their facilities, other than medical and religious structures, are clearly military objectives and, therefore, subject to direct cyber attacks.¹²⁰\nThe problem arises, however, when dual-use objects, objects that serve both military and civilian purposes such as airports and bridges, are targeted. The source of the dilemma in clearly defining military objectives versus non-military objectives is in interpreting the terms found in Article 52 of Additional Protocol I.¹²¹ Commentaries to the Protocol seem to define military objectives more narrowly, stating that they are objects \"directly used by the armed forces,\" locations \"of special importance for military operations,\" and objects intended for use or being used\n---\n¹¹⁷.

Chances are that if the attack results in none of the aforementioned consequences, the fact that a civilian object was targeted will probably be of little concern. This again underscores why the results of a cyber attack are central to the legal analysis.\n## C. The Attacks on Georgian Websites Likely Do Not Amount to an Instance of Armed Conflict, Such That IHL Governs\nAssuming that Russia was responsible for the cyber attacks on Georgia, the next question must be whether IHL governs this conflict. While the cyber attacks on Georgia appeared to eventually be part of a classic conflict in which the Russian military later invaded Georgia, the cyber conflict itself did not result in the kinds of consequences necessary to rise to the level of an armed conflict. As previously mentioned, during the cyber conflict, major Georgian servers were brought down, resulting in confusion throughout the country and hindering communication.¹²⁴ An argument could be made, perhaps, that damage or destruction was done to Georgian property, even if death or injury did not occur. Nevertheless, because it appears that the main results of the Georgian attacks were confusion and inconvenience, the attacks were thus permissible, regardless of whether the targets were deemed military or non-military objectives.¹²⁵\nEven so, cyber attacks that result in confusion, miscommunication, or the temporary shutdown of networks are serious problems, and can be harmful to countries that rely heavily on the Internet. Furthermore, it is entirely possible for the shutdown of a nation’s major websites to lead to far greater consequences.\nBecause investigators in one country do not ordinarily have the authority to cross international borders, the investigation into\n122. *Id.* at 380.\n123. *Id.* at 380-81.\n124.

Law enforcement or national security personnel cannot unilaterally pursue investigations into networks located in other countries.¹²⁶ Just as it is difficult to determine who conducted a cyber attack, it is equally difficult to determine what a permissible retaliatory response to this kind of attack is, especially when the attack inflicts minimal damage. In the absence of death or widespread destruction, whether the international community would consider a conventional military attack a proportionate response is questionable.¹²⁷ For example, although the United States recognizes that initial patterns of attack or infiltration can rise to the level of an armed attack, it takes the position that reprisals involving armed conflict or the use of force are illegal. The United States thus justifies a responsive use of force in the exercise of the right of self-defense.¹²⁸ Some also argue that cyber attacks require an expansion of the definition of the use of force, such that there would be greater permissible responses through self-defense.¹²⁹ But expanding the definition in order to create greater conflict is not necessary and does not serve any legitimate purpose, particularly when the initial attack does not result in widespread destruction or loss of life. Moreover, legal developments in this area should move in the direction of narrowing the permissible causes for armed conflict, not enlarging them.\nThe 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict provides a good example of how the many uncertainties and novelties of cyber warfare make the application of IHL difficult in certain instances. It is especially hard when determining responsibility for attacks or clearly defining the distinction between military and non-military objectives. An analysis of the Georgian attacks is meant to highlight the types of issues that arise when applying IHL to such conduct. This does not mean that IHL is not the proper regime to\n126. BRYAN W.

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND POWERFUL STATES MUST SET FORTH MORE EXPLICIT AND TRANSPARENT POLICIES REGARDING CYBER WARFARE ISSUES IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING IHL PRINCIPLES\nExisting principles governing the law of war need not be abandoned in the era of modern warfare. Rather, existing rules and mechanisms simply need to be applied in novel ways and old tenets of warfare must be rethought. The challenges, as well as the opportunities, of cyber warfare need to be better understood, and its laws and procedures need to be updated to accommodate the changes in global technology. Over the past few years, some states and international organizations have devoted considerable effort to devise and implement preventative measures aimed at ensuring better compliance with IHL in the event of a cyber attack.¹³¹ Expert seminars have been assembled to discuss various ideas and proposals, particularly through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).¹³² Many participants have acknowledged a positive obligation on states not involved in an armed conflict to take action against states that are violating IHL, particularly by using their influences to stop the violations.¹³³\nSome argue that a new international accord or treaty must be created in order to deal specifically with cyber warfare.¹³⁴ The rationale is that the Internet takes advantage of legal loopholes where state and non-state actors can ignore traditional Western notions of war as described by IHL and, therefore, more international laws are needed to apply directly to cyberspace.¹³⁵\n---\n¹³⁰. *Contra*.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\nInternational treaties, however, would not offer any real alternative to developing and continuing the dialogue among nations, and would likely complicate the issues at stake.¹³⁶ While technological improvements and transparent policies can help nations deal with the attribution problem, there still must be greater discourse regarding cyber warfare issues in order to clear up existing ambiguities.¹³⁷ Cyber warfare, if properly limited, may allow militaries to act on an expanded list of targets while also avoiding the loss of civilian lives.¹³⁸ In other words, cyber warfare could play an important niche role, by supplementing or amplifying more traditional forms of warfare.\nInternational organizations and states should continue their open dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues and should strive for transparency in their policies, such that there are clear international guidelines for how states can permissibly use computers to carry out attacks either independently or part and parcel of a traditional armed conflict. The international legal community must extend the existing IHL framework to apply to cyber warfare, and states must evolve new norms in the form of custom or codification based on experience.¹³⁹\n## A. The Role of International Organizations\nThe International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a specialized intergovernmental organization with state members and private organizational members.¹⁴⁰ Founded in 1865, it is now a constituent part of the UN. While the ITU's main purpose is adopting international regulations governing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, the organization's agenda also includes developing a global information infrastructure.¹⁴¹ In developing standards for online security and digital certificates, the ITU could also attempt to establish standards dealing with cyber attacks and information warfare. Regulations promulgated under the ITU\n136. See Kelsey, supra note 39, at 1449-50 (noting that the creation and enforcement of a new treaty for cyber warfare would prove to be difficult).\n137.

Even if there were stiffer repercussions, a country might still decide that these consequences would not outweigh its need to conduct operations against a particular adversary.¹⁴³ Because of the importance of satellites for international telecommunications, as well as for military command, control, and intelligence, some forms of cyber warfare may involve orbital assets and, thus, implicate the ITU and other telecommunication regulators.¹⁴⁴ Despite these concerns, the work of the ITU could still prove to be valuable in increasing international dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues, particularly through the ITU’s Global Cybersecurity Agenda, which works on coordinating responses to cyber attacks.¹⁴⁵\nThe European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was created in 2004 as a response to concerns about cyber security throughout the European Union.¹⁴⁶ Most of the efforts by the European Commission have resulted in creating technical standards specifically with regard to Internet governance, as opposed to supplementing international law norms. ENISA has, however, recognized the complexity of the technological environment and the threat posed by cyber attacks against electronic communications networks on the availability and integrity of the information accessed through these networks, creating a high-risk situation.¹⁴⁷ Similarly, an Asian regional forum, the Telecommunications and Information Working Group of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, has also promoted regional cooperation in fighting cyber attacks and terrorist misuse of cyber\n142.

The Malaysian government supported the establishment of the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism, or IMPACT, in May 2008.¹⁴⁹ IMPACT is focused mostly on the “‘upper end of cyber threats’” or attacks that would damage a nation’s critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control.¹⁵⁰ It is clear that individual nations or governments cannot address cyber warfare issues alone; international cooperation is required.¹⁵¹ The aforementioned organizations recognize the difficulties in applying IHL principles to cyber attacks, but are working to establish clearer policies on which nations can rely.\nAs mentioned earlier, a major concern is the ability to attribute a cyber attack to a particular government entity because, although an IP address can be tracked, it does not necessarily mean that a military or government official is behind the keyboard. In the near future, however, Internet anonymity may be lessened, thus making it easier to trace the source of cyber attacks.¹⁵² The UN National Security Agency has been participating in the “IP Traceback” drafting group since the fall of 2008. But this proposal has raised concerns among a number of international organizations. While the upshot of this may be that governments will be able to more effectively track cyber attacks to the source, it is also likely that this type of capability could be misused.¹⁵³ Some people believe that traceback mechanisms will no longer serve much of a purpose because there are too many sources in a DDoS attack to be useful, and the source computer was, in many cases, hacked in the first place.¹⁵⁴\nWhile the UN has no power to impose Internet standards on the world,¹⁵⁵ it has been lobbying for more influence over the way\n148.

While international organizations should continue to advocate transparent policies on cyber warfare in order to assist states, resorting to over-management of the Internet is not the right solution.\n## B. States Should Develop Clearly Defined Cyber Strategies and Comprehensive Government-Network Defenses\nThe conduct and practices of states are itself a major source of CIL and would assist in supplementing conventional norms regarding the law of war and its application to cyber warfare. Particularly, China and the United States serve as examples of states working to establish strong national policies on cyber attacks.\nThe Chinese military and nationally supported groups have prepared detailed plans regarding cyber attacks as a way to achieve electronic dominance.¹⁵⁷ China’s ambitions extend to crippling an enemy’s financial, military, and communications capabilities early in conflict, and there is evidence to indicate that China regards offensive computer operations as essential to taking control in the first stages of war.¹⁵⁸ Furthermore, China has developed viruses to attack enemy computers and has even recently hacked into the White House computer network.¹⁵⁹ While these plans may raise numerous concerns for other nations, China’s push to make cyber warfare an integral part of their national army is prudent. The sooner states embrace the concept of cyber warfare, the sooner IHL ambiguities can be resolved.\nEngineering standards are set by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), both of which are voluntary industry organizations. These private agencies have no regulatory power per se, but set standards that de facto control the Internet.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\nBecause cyber attacks are not going to disappear, it is better that states establish clear national policies, such that the rest of the international community can follow suit.\nThe United States has become increasingly concerned about the threats of cyber attacks. In recent years, there have been a series of cyber attacks on military and homeland security computer networks in the United States, many of which have been traced back to China.¹⁶⁰ Presumably as a way to deal with these dangers, the United States has developed cyber warfare contingency plans under the National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 16, which was implemented in 2002.¹⁶¹ The directive, however, has remained classified and, therefore, does little to deter potential enemies. Nevertheless, this directive apparently ordered the development of guidelines to regulate the use of cyber weapons in war. Additionally, NSPD 16 instituted strict rules of engagement requiring “top-level” approval for any such attack.¹⁶² Some people in the United States believe that the nation needs to do more to develop an offensive cyber war capability, similar to that of China.¹⁶³ In all reality, nations will probably not be able to develop a complete military offensive until there is further clarity in determining the attribution of attacks. Furthermore, the lines separating crime, terrorism, and warfare are often hard to draw.¹⁶⁴ Nevertheless, the United States is taking action by attempting to develop and sustain a cyber-force with personnel trained in conducting cyber warfare.¹⁶⁵ More nations should seek to develop transparent standards regarding cyber attacks so that the law can continue to develop and nations can better understand how respond to such attacks.\n160.

The Future of Cyber Warfare: The Cyber Defense Era\nThe near future of cyber warfare will likely resemble that of nuclear defense, in which the growing trend will be for nations to set up cyber defense systems as a way to deter cyber attacks by other nations. Recently, seven NATO countries backed the establishment of a new cyber warfare defense center in Estonia.¹⁶⁶ The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) began operations in the Fall of 2008, and conducts research and training in cyber warfare.¹⁶⁷ A large portion of the CCDCOE’s staff are specialists from the sponsoring countries, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Spain, and the United States has agreed to send an observer.¹⁶⁸ In June 2009, the CCDCOE held a Conference on Cyber Warfare to discuss definitions of cyber warfare and the enhancement of cyber defense capabilities.¹⁶⁹\nIn the near future, there will likely be greater adoption of counter-strategies by states in order to deflect radicalization that is used for inciting violence or attacking enemy infrastructures over the Internet. These strategies might include open-source intelligence gathering and infiltration efforts.¹⁷⁰ In addition, nations may also seek to take advantage of opportunities to use offensive information operations to achieve specific outcomes, including operations to undermine group cohesion and to interfere with decision-making, or to constrain terrorist activities in order to preempt attacks.¹⁷¹ The reason for this is that reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful cyber attacks.¹⁷² Thus, more effective defense measures should incorporate predictive, active, and preemptive elements.¹⁷³\nThe United States, through the Department of Defense (DOD), has also created a program known as Computer Network\n---\n¹⁶⁶.

Additionally, more nations will likely follow the United States’ lead by creating these kinds of defense mechanisms in the near future.\n## VI. CONCLUSION\nCyberspace has been in existence for a number of years, but government entities are increasingly taking advantage of this domain as a way to carry out various kinds of war-like attacks with the help of computers. This raises many concerns, given that major aspects of a nation’s critical or physical infrastructure are connected to cyberspace.¹⁷⁷\nThis article has shown that international laws that are currently in place do address the ever-changing nature of warfare. The Geneva Conventions, as well as the IHL principles of proportionality and unnecessary suffering, all provide a framework for addressing cyber warfare issues. The international legal community, however, must continue to work to address certain ambiguities that exist in applying IHL so that nations have a clear understanding as to how to go about carrying out or defending against a cyber attack. The key for states and international organizations in the upcoming years is to find better, more efficient ways to determine who is responsible for particular cyber attacks and to establish more transparent national policies regarding evolving cyber warfare issues. Although cyber attacks are usually not immediately directed at human beings, they do have the potential to indirectly cause severe injuries or even\n174. *Id.* at 2.\n175. *Id.* at 4.\n176. *Id.* at 12.\n177. *Solce, supra note 22, at 302.*\n2010]                                                                 The Era of Cyber Warfare                                                              333\ndeath.¹⁷⁸ The effects of a cyber attack will determine whether it is classified as an armed conflict for purposes of IHL. Additionally, the outcome of the attack will drive the victim-nation’s response.\nScience fiction literature and film are replete with future wars in which enemy nations or worlds disrupt civilian and military communications networks as a way to gain military and economic control.¹⁷⁹ Except that this is no longer science fiction. As early as 2001, it was recognized by the international community that cyber warfare would be a major threat in the future.¹⁸⁰\nAs expected, there are competing theories for how to best handle these changes in war tactics. Some advocate that a nation’s military should actually create a “Cyber Force” that focuses entirely on cyber attacks.¹⁸¹ Others argue that cyber attacks only produce a limited breadth of damage and, therefore, are not a major threat such that there should be international legal concerns.¹⁸² Nevertheless, the unpredictable consequences and unexpected adversarial advantages that stem from a cyber attack can be just as destructive and damaging as a physical attack. Accordingly, states and international organizations must take proactive stances toward establishing national cyber security strategies and adhering to international legal norms, with the recognition that cyber warfare is here to stay.\n---\n¹⁷⁸.

INTRODUCTION In early August 2008, a full-scale war broke out between Russia and Georgia over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a pro-Russian autonomous region of Georgia.¹ Bombs were dropped throughout the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, with Russian bombers targeting Georgia’s economic infrastructure, including the country’s largest Black Sea port, Poti, and the main road connecting the southern part of Georgia with the East.² In the two months leading up to this conflict, Georgia’s Internet infrastructure was also attacked and major Georgian website servers were brought down, hindering communication and causing confusion throughout the country.³ The kind of attacks used is known as distributed denial of service attacks.⁴ They are triggered * Senior Production Editor, Loyola of Los Angeles International &amp; Comparative Law Review (ILR), Volume 32; J.D., Loyola Law School, 2010; B.A., University of Southern California, 2007.

Most importantly, I want to thank my parents, my brother and sister, and Alex for their constant encouragement, support, and love.\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] when computers in a network are simultaneously ordered to bombard a website with millions of requests, which then overload the website server and cause it to shut down.⁵ These cyber attacks mainly hindered the Georgian government's ability to communicate with its citizens, as well as other nations, both before and during the physical invasion by Russia.⁶ Official Georgian websites, including those for the President's office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Defense were disabled, at least temporarily.⁷ Even after a cease-fire between the nations was ordered shortly after the physical invasion by Russia, major Georgian servers remained inoperable.⁸ The Russian-Georgian cyber conflict, which was perhaps the first time that cyber attacks were used alongside conventional military action,⁹ illustrates the havoc that can spread on the digital battlefield and re-energizes the debate over whether the laws of war apply to this new kind of warfare.\nWhether the world is prepared or not, cyber weapons are becoming a staple of modern war. Combat no longer consists solely of physical attacks or invasions among nations with distinct military units. This new kind of warfare uses a target nation's own technology against it, in order to bring down vital infrastructure.¹⁰ As Internet and computer technology continues to develop, so too will the methods and means of warfare. Moreover, given the low cost and wide availability of computers, as well as the ability to operate them anonymously, cyber attacks make for an attractive method of warfare.¹¹ In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks, both by nations and by non-state actors.¹²\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nCurrently, there is no provision in international humanitarian law (IHL)¹⁶ or customary international law (CIL)¹⁷ that explicitly outlaws cyber warfare or computer network attacks, either carried out independently or during times of war. This is understandable since the law of war dates back to the nineteenth century and has not yet been updated for applicability in the Information Age.¹⁸ Nonetheless, some legal restraints do apply.\nThis article argues that existing IHL principles should be used to analyze the legality of cyber attacks. Part II of this article discusses the increasing use of cyber warfare in international conflict. Part III of this article explains that IHL principles apply whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a state, are more than simply sporadic in nature and are intended to cause, or will foreseeably cause, injury, death, damage, or destruction. On the other hand, IHL most likely does not apply in the absence of those Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] consequences. Part IV applies IHL principles to the 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict. Given the complexities and novelties involved in this new kind of warfare, however, Part V further proposes that the international community and powerful states should seek to supplement existing IHL principles with more explicit and transparent policies that best correspond to modern Internet technology and address the ways in which this technology can legally be used to carry out cyber attacks.\nIn sum, this article addresses the use of cyber or computer network attacks and considers how jus in bello, or the body of law concerned with what is permissible during hostilities, governs such conflict.¹⁹ This article ultimately seeks to answer the question: “Does a cyber attack constitute an act of war such that international humanitarian law principles apply and govern its use?”\n## II. RECENT CYBER ATTACKS ILLUSTRATE HOW STATES ARE MORE FORCEFULLY ENGAGING IN CYBER WARFARE AS A MEANS TO WEAKEN OPPONENTS’ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES The Internet has emerged as a powerful tool for government functions, information, and mobilization, as well as commerce and social networking.²⁰ It has even become a way to disseminate ideological and political messages.²¹ With the increase in utilization of the Internet for more than just economic and social functions, the international community must be aware that it can also serve as a tool for conducting operations that lead to confusion, destruction, and even death. Examples of cyber attacks against nations in recent history underscore the potential implications in using the Internet as a weapon in war, as well as how there is now clear international recognition of cyberspace as a battlefield. This is evidenced by the fact that information warfare systems are currently being developed and used by at least 120 countries, including Peru, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Croatia, Vietnam, and Russia.²² In order to fully understand cyber attacks and their 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 307 implications, one must first define cyber warfare and its related concepts.\n## A. What is Cyber Warfare?\nThe U.S. Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”²³ Such harm could be inflicted on the computer network, as well as to physical facilities and persons. Cyber attacks are distinct from cyber crimes, which are governed by national criminal statutes and include such acts as identity theft and Internet fraud.²⁴ Cyber attacks, unlike cyber crimes, involve “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”²⁵ In order to fully comprehend what is meant by cyber warfare, the concept of “cyberspace” should also be explored. Essentially, cyberspace is the sum of electronic networks including, but not limited to, the Internet, where various information operations occur.²⁶ Information warfare, on the other hand, is narrower than information operations and is defined as “information operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict to achieve or promote Christensen, *Bracing for Guerrilla Warfare in Cyberspace: ‘There are Lots of Opportunities; That’s Very Scary’*, CNN.COM, Apr. 6, 1999, http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/cyberterror/).\n\nspecific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries.”²⁷ Information warfare has been conducted since at least the sixth century BC.²⁸ Even before the rise of cyberspace, warring parties used electronic deception and disruption as essential ingredients of “real war.” For instance, the U.S. Air Force has had information warfare squadrons since the 1980s, which were used successfully during the first Gulf War.²⁹ Information operations is an evolving discipline within many nations’s militaries.\nCyber warfare is simply the latest form of information warfare,³⁰ and can include computer network attacks (CNA), which consist of “operations to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers or computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”³¹ A CNA essentially involves the “hacking” of another nation’s computer network, but uses data systems, as opposed to physical weapons, to execute the attack.³² ## B. Recent Cyber Attacks and the Resulting Damage Cyber attacks that have taken place in the past few years illustrate how states are utilizing modern technology and more forcefully engaging in information warfare to weaken opponents’ critical infrastructures. There is significant international concern that hostile foreign governments could preemptively launch computer-based attacks on integral national or regional systems, such as those supporting energy distribution, telecommunications, 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 309 and financial services.³³ Since everything from transportation to commodity supply to health care to public safety to military operations now relies on computer information systems,³⁴ cyber attacks have the potential to cause far greater damage than conventional weapons.\nRecent publicly-known cyber attacks include attacks on Lithuanian commercial and government websites in June 2008, attacks on Estonian government websites in 2007, an e-mail breach in the Pentagon in June 2007, and hacks into Pakistan’s state-owned telephone company’s website in January 2003.³⁵ Around August 2008, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks temporarily disabled official Georgian websites, including those for the President’s office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Defense, and led to communication problems throughout the country.³⁶ Even more recently, it has been discovered that Chinese hackers have breached the White House computer networks on numerous occasions, obtaining e-mail communication exchanged among government officials.³⁷ Additionally, the damage caused by many of these attacks included injury, death, and property damage. In perhaps the most extreme example, the 2007 attacks on Estonian websites caused more than just confusion for the nation’s population. At the time of these attacks, Estonia had essentially instituted an “e-government” where many aspects of the government were carried Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] out online.³⁸ In addition to bringing down many of Estonia's critical government and commercial websites, the cyber attacks also caused the emergency phone number used for calling ambulances and the fire service to be unavailable for more than one hour.³⁹ As a result, widespread social unrest and rioting left 150 people injured and one Russian national dead.⁴⁰ In contrast, the Lithuanian attacks involved the defacement of government and commercial websites with anti-Lithuanian rhetoric and communist symbols.⁴¹ The government, however, was able to prepare sufficient defenses to these attacks.⁴² These two examples demonstrate that the damage from a cyber attack can often be unpredictable.\n## C. The Methods Used in Carrying Out a Cyber Attack Cyber weapons are not like traditional weapons of warfare. Individuals or nations that use cyber weapons may choose from a variety of options, including syntactic, semantic, and mixed weapons.⁴³ Syntactic weapons, which target a computer's operating system, include malicious code, such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, DDoS, and spyware.⁴⁴ Through DDoS attacks, like those used against Georgia, the cyber attacker shuts down a website by bombarding it with large amounts of traffic.⁴⁵ Conversely, semantic weapons target\"the accuracy of information to which the computer user has access.\"⁴⁶ In other words, a semantic attack consists of altering information that enters the computer's system 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 311 in order to produce errors without the user’s knowledge.⁴⁷ Mixed or blended weapons combine syntactic and semantic weapons to attack both information and the computer’s operating system, resulting in a more sophisticated attack.⁴⁸ An example of a mixed weapon is a “bot network,” which is a proliferation of “bots,” surreptitiously planted on innocent third-party computers. Bots are remote-controlled computer programs that infect other computers. A hacker who controls the bots can spy, copy, and transmit sensitive data, as well as organize the bots in a swarm attack against targeted computers.⁴⁹ Attacked computers or networks are systems that have been infected with malicious software through the use of these weapons, and that are then brought under the control of an attacker in a remote location.⁵⁰ Infected devices continually listen for commands from the attacker and act upon them, with the intention of compromising the opponent’s security or critical infrastructure.⁵¹ The Internet was originally a network of computers linked to the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s and 1970s.⁵² As the computer networks of universities and private research facilities merged through the development of hypertext, a global network with benefits to both military and civilian sectors was created.⁵³ The new technology, however, has also created vulnerabilities for nations that rely heavily on the Internet, especially in their military and governmental infrastructures.⁵⁴ This has created an opportunity for warring parties to exploit network vulnerabilities with various cyber weapons and attacks.\n--- Loy.

INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW SHOULD GOVERN THE LEGALITY OF CYBER ATTACKS WHEN SUCH ATTACKS CONSTITUTE ARMED CONFLICT Information gathering and disruption have always been major tools of war. Disrupting an enemy's communications networks may even have greater strategic value than destroying its arsenals or supply lines. Indeed, some information warfare methods are considered so unsavory as to be prohibited by the laws of war.\nWhile a cyber attack is not truly kinetic or physical in nature like traditional forms of weaponry, a cyber attack may still lead to major physical destruction and even death.55 Therefore, because of these possible consequences, a cyber attack could constitute an armed conflict, such that IHL governs, if certain criteria are met. The threshold question is under what circumstances can a cyber attack be deemed an armed conflict, such that IHL applies. This is an important question because its answer provides guidance to nations on how they can respond to such attacks in a way that is consistent with international legal norms.\n## A. International Humanitarian Law Background IHL is the branch of public international law that\"seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering which it causes.\"56 It is one of two principle divisions of the laws of war and is termed jus in bello, or the\"law in war.\"57 The other division is known as jus ad bellum, or the\"law to war,\"which governs the legality of resorting to armed force.58 The terms\"law of war\"and\"law of armed conflict\"are synonymous.\nJus in bello traditionally involves both Geneva and Hague law. Geneva law rests on the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols.59 These treaties are particularly concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict, with Additional Protocol I focusing on the means and methods of warfare. Conversely, Hague law refers to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, and is mainly concerned with methods and means of warfare, tactics, and the general conduct of hostilities. In modern\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\n## B. The Applicability of IHL to Cyber Attacks\nThe law of armed conflict, as a part of international law, is binding on states, yet a violation may also involve the prosecution of individuals for war crimes.⁶¹ Some have argued that IHL cannot govern cyber attacks because there is nothing physical or kinetic about such operations.⁶² In other words, a CNA is not an armed conflict in the true sense of the phrase and, therefore, such an attack falls outside of the scope of IHL. Article 2, which is common to all four of the Geneva Conventions, provides that “[i]n addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”⁶³ Additional Protocol I also relies on this same “armed conflict” language. Article 1(3) of Additional Protocol I states that “[t]his Protocol, which supplements the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims, shall apply in the situations referred to in Article 2 common to those Conventions.”⁶⁴ Thus, in order for IHL to govern a cyber attack, such an attack must in fact constitute an armed conflict.\nNevertheless, commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their subsequent Additional Protocols have posited that “armed conflict” can be viewed in a fairly expansive way.⁶⁵ Armed conflict has been defined as “any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces.”⁶⁶ A\n⁶⁰. *Id.*\n⁶¹.

Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303]\ndispute resulting in the engagement of armed forces, however, cannot be the sole criterion. For example, the replacement of border police with soldiers or an accidental border incursion by members of the armed forces would not amount to an armed conflict.67 Thus, some degree of intensity and duration must be considered, as underlying principles of IHL make clear.68 IHL is founded upon the idea that victims of armed conflict, including personnel who have been rendered hors de combat,69 are entitled to protection.70 This protection is “usually framed in terms of injury, death, or in the case of property, damage or destruction.”71 Therefore, fundamental principles of IHL provide that armed conflict occurs when a group takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy,72 thereby narrowing the definition of armed conflict and limiting its applicability.\nFrom the above discussion, it logically follows that a cyber attack may constitute armed conflict, even though the use of a computer as a weapon is not a traditional or physical method of warfare, as long as certain consequences arise. While cyber attacks employ modern technology not conceived of during the drafting of the Geneva Conventions, the language of Additional Protocol I, and in particular Article 36, indicate that the drafters anticipated the application of the rules to new developments in warfare methods.73 The law of armed conflict must change and develop to account for new humanitarian imperatives that may be generated\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nAdditional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides important guidance in assessing the applicability of IHL to cyber attacks. Additional Protocol I codifies many existing principles of CIL and introduces important new treaty provisions relating to international armed conflict.77 Some provisions of Additional Protocol I are controversial such that they are said to only bind state parties to the treaty and, thus, they do not reflect customary law.78 Nevertheless, the significance of Additional Protocol I, as it relates to cyber warfare specifically and jus in bello generally, is that it supplements the original Geneva Conventions as they apply to civilians in an armed conflict as well as to the prohibited methods of warfare in situations of conflict.79 A key aspect of Additional Protocol I is the “doctrine of unnecessary suffering,” which is fundamental to jus in bello in general.80 Article 35 states: “In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.”81 This principle serves to place some limits on the barbarity and the range of means and weapons Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] that are available in today's modern society. Furthermore, Additional Protocol I was the first treaty to set out specifically the principle of proportionality, which requires that the losses resulting from military action should not be excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.⁸² Proportionality closely relates to the concept of indiscriminate attacks. Article 51(5)(b) describes an indiscriminate attack as one that\"may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\"⁸³ These principles are important to cyber warfare because they require that the attacker refrain from attacks that may be expected to cause excessive collateral damage.⁸⁴ Similar to nuclear weapons, cyber weapons are arguably sui generis or, in other words, they are unique in their characteristics and therefore should be governed by a unique set of laws.⁸⁵ Nevertheless, cyber weapons, just like nuclear weapons, are weapons that result in consequences similar to that of traditional weapons. Accordingly, IHL principles, such as the concept of unnecessary suffering and proportionality, still have relevance in the case of a cyber attack. Often, the question simply will be: To what extent do these principles apply? While some uncertainties remain, what is clear from this discussion is that an\"armed conflict\"occurs when an actor takes measures that injure, kill, damage, or destroy, regardless of the weapon used.⁸⁶ Scholars agree that an armed conflict exists and IHL governs once kinetic weapons are used in combination with CNAs.⁸⁷ The question becomes more difficult when computer networks conduct the first or only hostile acts. The key in assessing such conduct, however, is the effects or consequences of the attacks. Based on this framework, IHL applies whenever cyber attacks, ascribed to a ⁸².

See APPLICABILITY OF THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS TO COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS, supra note 73, at 2.\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare The reason why a consequence-based approach is necessary in analyzing the application of IHL to cyber attacks is because once armed conflict has commenced, the means by which injury, death, damage, or destruction are produced has no bearing on the legality of that conduct.⁹⁰ Thus, a lone cyber attack is subject to IHL if these particular consequences result.\nArticle 48 of Additional Protocol I mandates that parties to a conflict direct their operations against military objectives.⁹¹ Thus, targeting a military object, such as military air traffic control system, would be permissible. Since it is often the case that a CNA would target not purely military objectives, the next question is whether targeting civilian computer networks or systems are permissible. Based on the language of Article 48, however, the prohibition is not so much on targeting non-military objectives as it is on attacking them through acts of violence.⁹² Consequently, IHL would prohibit cyber attacks directed against non-military objectives that are intended to, or would foreseeably, cause injury, death, destruction, or damage.⁹³ On the other hand, an attack targeting a non-military objective that is not likely to result in the aforementioned consequences would be permissible.⁹⁴ --- ⁸⁸.

THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN CYBER CONFLICT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITIES IN APPLYING IHL TO CYBER ATTACKS\nSince IHL may apply to cyber warfare in certain situations depending on the results of an attack, it is not necessary to create a completely new set of laws or form a new treaty to apply solely to cyber attacks. Nevertheless, applying IHL to the 2008 cyber conflict involving Russia and Georgia illustrates the difficulties in being able to implement fully IHL in these instances and to articulate concretely the reactions to such attacks. The most notable difficulties involve attributing responsibility for the attacks and determining the difference between military objectives and non-military objectives in the context of targeted websites and computer systems.\n### A. Was Russia Responsible for the Attacks on Georgian Websites?\nBoth Russia and Georgia are state parties to Additional Protocol I, which pertains to the protection of victims of international armed conflict.⁹⁵ Thus, as parties to the treaty, its provisions bind them, including the duty before carrying out an attack to “do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are . . . military objectives.”⁹⁶ Even for states not a party to the Protocol, customary law would still require their forces to attack only military objectives, meaning that these targets must be distinguished from civilian objectives.⁹⁷ The Institute of International Law even points out that existing international law prohibits the use of all weapons that, by their nature, affect indiscriminately both military and non-military objectives.⁹⁸\nAdditional Protocol I further requires that in the time of armed conflict, states must ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to counsel military commanders regarding the application of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol\n---\n⁹⁵.

Nevertheless, given the relatively small amount of equipment required to launch a cyber attack and the pervasiveness of the Internet, ascertaining whether Russia, as opposed to non-state actors, was responsible for the attacks on Georgian websites, such that legal implications are created, is extremely difficult. Conversely, actually engaging in cyber war or bombarding a website is relatively simple. As demonstrated by one reporter, all one needs to do is save a copy of a certain Georgian web page to one’s hard drive and then open it on the computer’s browser. Once accessed, the page will load thumb-nailed versions of a dozen key Georgian websites in a single window. All the cyber “soldier” must do is set the page to update automatically every three to five seconds and from then on the browser will continue to send thousands of queries to the most important Georgian websites, helping to overload them and bring them down.⁹⁹ This is the simple way of bringing down a website, but there are more sophisticated and creative options, including obtaining certain kinds of software to carry out DDoS attacks.¹⁰¹\nThe evidence is currently not clear whether Russia was involved in the shutdown of Georgian websites or whether the attacks can be attributed to non-state actors.¹⁰² Jose Nazario, an Internet security specialist, believes that non-state actors likely caused the attacks on Georgian websites, because there is a history of the kind of botnet attacks involved previously attacking commercial or non-political targets.¹⁰³ Cyber attacks are often difficult to trace and it can take several months to reach definitive answers. For example, in 1998 an investigation by U.S. intelligence\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] officials initially linked Iraq to a series of breaches of the Department of Defense computers. The real suspects ended up being two teenagers in Northern California.¹⁰⁴ Project Grey Goose, an open-source initiative launched on August 22, 2008, has examined the Russian-Georgian cyber war and has drawn conclusions regarding the Russian government's involvement in the attacks.¹⁰⁵ The group based its conclusion on data collected from two Russian hacker forums, www.xakep.ru and www.stopgeorgian.ru, along with network log files detailing 29,000 status events indicating the up/down status of 149 Georgian websites.¹⁰⁶ In its Phase I Report issued on October 17, 2008, Project Grey Goose concluded that\"the Russian government will likely continue its practice of distancing itself from the Russian nationalistic hacker community thus gaining deniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their actions.\"¹⁰⁷ The group was unable to find any direct link to Russian state organizations guiding the attacks, but maintained that there is significant historical evidence that Russian officials endorse cyber warfare initiated by their country's hacker community.¹⁰⁸ For example, General Vladislav Sherstyuk, the current Russian Federation Security Council Deputy Secretary and former Deputy Director of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information, stated in 2002 that\"strike-capable military computer viruses\"would be used in the cyber battlefield.¹⁰⁹ Furthermore, a letter from a Russian Duma member stated in March 2006:\"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers, that is hackers.\"¹¹⁰ As Project Grey Goose noted, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is no connection between Russian hackers and the 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 321 Russian government. There has been consistent support from members of the Russian government and essentially an implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hackers’ attacks.¹¹¹ If indeed the Russian government or persons acting on behalf of the Russian government were responsible for the attacks on Georgian sites, then the only question as to the applicability of IHL would be whether such attacks resulted in death, damage, destruction, or injury.\nBesides the possibility of ordinary Russian citizens being responsible for the attacks, analysts have also accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a network of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and government, of the Georgian attacks.¹¹² Visits to Georgian government websites seemingly were re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey where the traffic was blocked. According to experts, these servers are widely known to be under the control of the RBN and influenced by the Russian government.¹¹³ If the RBN were acting on behalf of the Russian government, then this would constitute conduct by a state.¹¹⁴ If the actors were civilians, the problem in applying IHL becomes more complex. Even civilians or non-state actors who attempt to neutralize an enemy network, via a CNA that results in the aforementioned consequences, could be considered as direct participants in hostilities for purposes of Geneva law.¹¹⁵ This would mean that these civilians are illegal combatants and, therefore, not immune from retaliatory attack.¹¹⁶ Civilians could also be subject --- Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. [Vol. 32:303] to criminal prosecution under domestic law for the mere fact of taking part in hostilities.¹¹⁷ If the actors who carried out the cyber attacks against Georgia were members of Russia's armed forces, such personnel would have all the rights and liabilities of combatants. They could be attacked in retaliation like any other military personnel and could be able to achieve prisoner of war status. Again, the situation becomes more problematic when the technicians that act for the nation or military are not incorporated into the armed forces, but rather are simply computer-savvy civilians.¹¹⁸ ## B. Defining Military Objectives As mentioned above, in the context of military operations, only military objectives may be directly attacked. The definition of military objectives as provided in Additional Protocol I may be considered a part of CIL. Under Article 52(2) of the Protocol,\"military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\"¹¹⁹ Military equipment and their facilities, other than medical and religious structures, are clearly military objectives and, therefore, subject to direct cyber attacks.¹²⁰ The problem arises, however, when dual-use objects, objects that serve both military and civilian purposes such as airports and bridges, are targeted. The source of the dilemma in clearly defining military objectives versus non-military objectives is in interpreting the terms found in Article 52 of Additional Protocol I.¹²¹ Commentaries to the Protocol seem to define military objectives more narrowly, stating that they are objects\"directly used by the armed forces,\"locations\"of special importance for military operations,\"and objects intended for use or being used --- ¹¹⁷.

See Wired Warfare, supra note 27, at 380, 384-85.\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 323 for military purposes.¹²² In contrast, nations like the United States take a more expansive approach by including economic targets as military objectives.¹²³ Essentially, once the determination is made whether a cyber attack caused injury, death, damage or destruction, opinions will likely differ on whether the intended target was a civilian or military object. Chances are that if the attack results in none of the aforementioned consequences, the fact that a civilian object was targeted will probably be of little concern. This again underscores why the results of a cyber attack are central to the legal analysis.\n## C. The Attacks on Georgian Websites Likely Do Not Amount to an Instance of Armed Conflict, Such That IHL Governs Assuming that Russia was responsible for the cyber attacks on Georgia, the next question must be whether IHL governs this conflict. While the cyber attacks on Georgia appeared to eventually be part of a classic conflict in which the Russian military later invaded Georgia, the cyber conflict itself did not result in the kinds of consequences necessary to rise to the level of an armed conflict. As previously mentioned, during the cyber conflict, major Georgian servers were brought down, resulting in confusion throughout the country and hindering communication.¹²⁴ An argument could be made, perhaps, that damage or destruction was done to Georgian property, even if death or injury did not occur. Nevertheless, because it appears that the main results of the Georgian attacks were confusion and inconvenience, the attacks were thus permissible, regardless of whether the targets were deemed military or non-military objectives.¹²⁵ Even so, cyber attacks that result in confusion, miscommunication, or the temporary shutdown of networks are serious problems, and can be harmful to countries that rely heavily on the Internet. Furthermore, it is entirely possible for the shutdown of a nation’s major websites to lead to far greater consequences.\nBecause investigators in one country do not ordinarily have the authority to cross international borders, the investigation into Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] the source of a cyber attack is often difficult. Law enforcement or national security personnel cannot unilaterally pursue investigations into networks located in other countries.¹²⁶ Just as it is difficult to determine who conducted a cyber attack, it is equally difficult to determine what a permissible retaliatory response to this kind of attack is, especially when the attack inflicts minimal damage. In the absence of death or widespread destruction, whether the international community would consider a conventional military attack a proportionate response is questionable.¹²⁷ For example, although the United States recognizes that initial patterns of attack or infiltration can rise to the level of an armed attack, it takes the position that reprisals involving armed conflict or the use of force are illegal. The United States thus justifies a responsive use of force in the exercise of the right of self-defense.¹²⁸ Some also argue that cyber attacks require an expansion of the definition of the use of force, such that there would be greater permissible responses through self-defense.¹²⁹ But expanding the definition in order to create greater conflict is not necessary and does not serve any legitimate purpose, particularly when the initial attack does not result in widespread destruction or loss of life. Moreover, legal developments in this area should move in the direction of narrowing the permissible causes for armed conflict, not enlarging them.\nThe 2008 Russian-Georgian cyber conflict provides a good example of how the many uncertainties and novelties of cyber warfare make the application of IHL difficult in certain instances. It is especially hard when determining responsibility for attacks or clearly defining the distinction between military and non-military objectives. An analysis of the Georgian attacks is meant to highlight the types of issues that arise when applying IHL to such conduct. This does not mean that IHL is not the proper regime to 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 325 deal with cyber attacks in the future.¹³⁰ Rather, it underscores the continued work that must be done by the international community in the upcoming years to more clearly define certain terms and to set forth more transparent policies. What is clear, however, is that cyber attacks should only be undertaken in a way that respects international law principles.\n## V. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND POWERFUL STATES MUST SET FORTH MORE EXPLICIT AND TRANSPARENT POLICIES REGARDING CYBER WARFARE ISSUES IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING IHL PRINCIPLES Existing principles governing the law of war need not be abandoned in the era of modern warfare. Rather, existing rules and mechanisms simply need to be applied in novel ways and old tenets of warfare must be rethought. The challenges, as well as the opportunities, of cyber warfare need to be better understood, and its laws and procedures need to be updated to accommodate the changes in global technology. Over the past few years, some states and international organizations have devoted considerable effort to devise and implement preventative measures aimed at ensuring better compliance with IHL in the event of a cyber attack.¹³¹ Expert seminars have been assembled to discuss various ideas and proposals, particularly through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).¹³² Many participants have acknowledged a positive obligation on states not involved in an armed conflict to take action against states that are violating IHL, particularly by using their influences to stop the violations.¹³³ Some argue that a new international accord or treaty must be created in order to deal specifically with cyber warfare.¹³⁴ The rationale is that the Internet takes advantage of legal loopholes where state and non-state actors can ignore traditional Western notions of war as described by IHL and, therefore, more international laws are needed to apply directly to cyberspace.¹³⁵ --- ¹³⁰. *Contra*.

Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] International treaties, however, would not offer any real alternative to developing and continuing the dialogue among nations, and would likely complicate the issues at stake.¹³⁶ While technological improvements and transparent policies can help nations deal with the attribution problem, there still must be greater discourse regarding cyber warfare issues in order to clear up existing ambiguities.¹³⁷ Cyber warfare, if properly limited, may allow militaries to act on an expanded list of targets while also avoiding the loss of civilian lives.¹³⁸ In other words, cyber warfare could play an important niche role, by supplementing or amplifying more traditional forms of warfare.\nInternational organizations and states should continue their open dialogue regarding cyber warfare issues and should strive for transparency in their policies, such that there are clear international guidelines for how states can permissibly use computers to carry out attacks either independently or part and parcel of a traditional armed conflict. The international legal community must extend the existing IHL framework to apply to cyber warfare, and states must evolve new norms in the form of custom or codification based on experience.¹³⁹ ## A. The Role of International Organizations The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a specialized intergovernmental organization with state members and private organizational members.¹⁴⁰ Founded in 1865, it is now a constituent part of the UN. While the ITU's main purpose is adopting international regulations governing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, the organization's agenda also includes developing a global information infrastructure.¹⁴¹ In developing standards for online security and digital certificates, the ITU could also attempt to establish standards dealing with cyber attacks and information warfare. Regulations promulgated under the ITU\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare\n\nThe European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was created in 2004 as a response to concerns about cyber security throughout the European Union.¹⁴⁶ Most of the efforts by the European Commission have resulted in creating technical standards specifically with regard to Internet governance, as opposed to supplementing international law norms. ENISA has, however, recognized the complexity of the technological environment and the threat posed by cyber attacks against electronic communications networks on the availability and integrity of the information accessed through these networks, creating a high-risk situation.¹⁴⁷ Similarly, an Asian regional forum, the Telecommunications and Information Working Group of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, has also promoted regional cooperation in fighting cyber attacks and terrorist misuse of cyber Loy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] space.¹⁴⁸ Other Asian countries are also looking to bolster cyber defenses. The Malaysian government supported the establishment of the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism, or IMPACT, in May 2008.¹⁴⁹ IMPACT is focused mostly on the “‘upper end of cyber threats’” or attacks that would damage a nation’s critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control.¹⁵⁰ It is clear that individual nations or governments cannot address cyber warfare issues alone; international cooperation is required.¹⁵¹ The aforementioned organizations recognize the difficulties in applying IHL principles to cyber attacks, but are working to establish clearer policies on which nations can rely.\nAs mentioned earlier, a major concern is the ability to attribute a cyber attack to a particular government entity because, although an IP address can be tracked, it does not necessarily mean that a military or government official is behind the keyboard. In the near future, however, Internet anonymity may be lessened, thus making it easier to trace the source of cyber attacks.¹⁵² The UN National Security Agency has been participating in the “IP Traceback” drafting group since the fall of 2008. But this proposal has raised concerns among a number of international organizations. While the upshot of this may be that governments will be able to more effectively track cyber attacks to the source, it is also likely that this type of capability could be misused.¹⁵³ Some people believe that traceback mechanisms will no longer serve much of a purpose because there are too many sources in a DDoS attack to be useful, and the source computer was, in many cases, hacked in the first place.¹⁵⁴ While the UN has no power to impose Internet standards on the world,¹⁵⁵ it has been lobbying for more influence over the way 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 329 the Internet is managed, most prominently through the World Summit on the Information Society.¹⁵⁶ Still, it is unlikely that any sort of mandatory IP Traceback or authentication regime will or could be imposed by national governments or international bodies. While international organizations should continue to advocate transparent policies on cyber warfare in order to assist states, resorting to over-management of the Internet is not the right solution.\n## B. States Should Develop Clearly Defined Cyber Strategies and Comprehensive Government-Network Defenses The conduct and practices of states are itself a major source of CIL and would assist in supplementing conventional norms regarding the law of war and its application to cyber warfare. Particularly, China and the United States serve as examples of states working to establish strong national policies on cyber attacks.\nThe Chinese military and nationally supported groups have prepared detailed plans regarding cyber attacks as a way to achieve electronic dominance.¹⁵⁷ China’s ambitions extend to crippling an enemy’s financial, military, and communications capabilities early in conflict, and there is evidence to indicate that China regards offensive computer operations as essential to taking control in the first stages of war.¹⁵⁸ Furthermore, China has developed viruses to attack enemy computers and has even recently hacked into the White House computer network.¹⁵⁹ While these plans may raise numerous concerns for other nations, China’s push to make cyber warfare an integral part of their national army is prudent. The sooner states embrace the concept of cyber warfare, the sooner IHL ambiguities can be resolved.\nEngineering standards are set by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), both of which are voluntary industry organizations. These private agencies have no regulatory power per se, but set standards that de facto control the Internet. WORKING GROUP ON INTERNET GOVERNANCE, BACKGROUND REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON INTERNET GOVERNANCE (2005), available at http://www.wgig.org/docs/BackgroundReport.pdf.\n\nLoy. L.A. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev.\n[Vol. 32:303] Because cyber attacks are not going to disappear, it is better that states establish clear national policies, such that the rest of the international community can follow suit.\nThe United States has become increasingly concerned about the threats of cyber attacks. In recent years, there have been a series of cyber attacks on military and homeland security computer networks in the United States, many of which have been traced back to China.¹⁶⁰ Presumably as a way to deal with these dangers, the United States has developed cyber warfare contingency plans under the National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 16, which was implemented in 2002.¹⁶¹ The directive, however, has remained classified and, therefore, does little to deter potential enemies. Nevertheless, this directive apparently ordered the development of guidelines to regulate the use of cyber weapons in war. Additionally, NSPD 16 instituted strict rules of engagement requiring “top-level” approval for any such attack.¹⁶² Some people in the United States believe that the nation needs to do more to develop an offensive cyber war capability, similar to that of China.¹⁶³ In all reality, nations will probably not be able to develop a complete military offensive until there is further clarity in determining the attribution of attacks. Furthermore, the lines separating crime, terrorism, and warfare are often hard to draw.¹⁶⁴ Nevertheless, the United States is taking action by attempting to develop and sustain a cyber-force with personnel trained in conducting cyber warfare.¹⁶⁵ More nations should seek to develop transparent standards regarding cyber attacks so that the law can continue to develop and nations can better understand how respond to such attacks.\n\n2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 331 ## C. The Future of Cyber Warfare: The Cyber Defense Era The near future of cyber warfare will likely resemble that of nuclear defense, in which the growing trend will be for nations to set up cyber defense systems as a way to deter cyber attacks by other nations. Recently, seven NATO countries backed the establishment of a new cyber warfare defense center in Estonia.¹⁶⁶ The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) began operations in the Fall of 2008, and conducts research and training in cyber warfare.¹⁶⁷ A large portion of the CCDCOE’s staff are specialists from the sponsoring countries, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Spain, and the United States has agreed to send an observer.¹⁶⁸ In June 2009, the CCDCOE held a Conference on Cyber Warfare to discuss definitions of cyber warfare and the enhancement of cyber defense capabilities.¹⁶⁹ In the near future, there will likely be greater adoption of counter-strategies by states in order to deflect radicalization that is used for inciting violence or attacking enemy infrastructures over the Internet. These strategies might include open-source intelligence gathering and infiltration efforts.¹⁷⁰ In addition, nations may also seek to take advantage of opportunities to use offensive information operations to achieve specific outcomes, including operations to undermine group cohesion and to interfere with decision-making, or to constrain terrorist activities in order to preempt attacks.¹⁷¹ The reason for this is that reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful cyber attacks.¹⁷² Thus, more effective defense measures should incorporate predictive, active, and preemptive elements.¹⁷³ The United States, through the Department of Defense (DOD), has also created a program known as Computer Network --- ¹⁶⁶.

Additionally, more nations will likely follow the United States’ lead by creating these kinds of defense mechanisms in the near future.\n## VI. CONCLUSION Cyberspace has been in existence for a number of years, but government entities are increasingly taking advantage of this domain as a way to carry out various kinds of war-like attacks with the help of computers. This raises many concerns, given that major aspects of a nation’s critical or physical infrastructure are connected to cyberspace.¹⁷⁷ This article has shown that international laws that are currently in place do address the ever-changing nature of warfare. The Geneva Conventions, as well as the IHL principles of proportionality and unnecessary suffering, all provide a framework for addressing cyber warfare issues. The international legal community, however, must continue to work to address certain ambiguities that exist in applying IHL so that nations have a clear understanding as to how to go about carrying out or defending against a cyber attack. The key for states and international organizations in the upcoming years is to find better, more efficient ways to determine who is responsible for particular cyber attacks and to establish more transparent national policies regarding evolving cyber warfare issues. Although cyber attacks are usually not immediately directed at human beings, they do have the potential to indirectly cause severe injuries or even 2010] The Era of Cyber Warfare 333 death.¹⁷⁸ The effects of a cyber attack will determine whether it is classified as an armed conflict for purposes of IHL. Additionally, the outcome of the attack will drive the victim-nation’s response.\nScience fiction literature and film are replete with future wars in which enemy nations or worlds disrupt civilian and military communications networks as a way to gain military and economic control.¹⁷⁹ Except that this is no longer science fiction. As early as 2001, it was recognized by the international community that cyber warfare would be a major threat in the future.¹⁸⁰ As expected, there are competing theories for how to best handle these changes in war tactics. Some advocate that a nation’s military should actually create a “Cyber Force” that focuses entirely on cyber attacks.¹⁸¹ Others argue that cyber attacks only produce a limited breadth of damage and, therefore, are not a major threat such that there should be international legal concerns.¹⁸² Nevertheless, the unpredictable consequences and unexpected adversarial advantages that stem from a cyber attack can be just as destructive and damaging as a physical attack. Accordingly, states and international organizations must take proactive stances toward establishing national cyber security strategies and adhering to international legal norms, with the recognition that cyber warfare is here to stay.\n--- ¹⁷⁸.
