INTRODUCTION\nGlobally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks.\nIn this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?\n1.

(3) What are the applicable international laws that can regulate or prevent cyberattacks? For these purposes, this Article is divided into three main Parts. Part II will explain the severity and nature of the threats posed by cyberattacks, by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. Part III will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international laws applicable to cyberattacks. Part IV will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks.\n## II. THREATS\nThis Part will explain the severity and nature of threats posed by cyberattacks by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. It is divided into three sections: Section A will discuss espionage using cyberattacks as a threat to nations; Section B will discuss terrorism through cyberattacks as a threat; and Section C will discuss other cyberoperations employed by aggressive states against victim states.\n### A. Espionage\nThe prevalence⁹ of cyberespionage is emerging as a threat to the peace and security of the world. Currently, the Internet or cyberspace is considered a “gift from God” for surveillance and espionage purposes,¹⁰ and this age has been called a “golden age for espionage.”¹¹ In cyberespionage, unauthorized states and nonstate actors infiltrate computer information systems to collect confidential information.¹² Cyberespionage can be defined as “[o]perations and related programs or activities conducted . . . in or through cyberspace, for the primary purpose of collecting intelligence . . . from, computers, information or communication systems, or networks, with the intent to remain\n9.

General Assembly, and he cancelled his scheduled meetings with the United States.²⁶ He said that the NSA had violated international law,²⁷ the sovereignty of the Brazilian nation, and the fundamental human rights of its citizens.²⁸ In regard to NSA leaked documents, The Guardian established that Angela Merkel’s activities had been monitored for more than a decade.²⁹ Such activity can be seen as a breach of the German state’s sovereignty.³⁰ In response, Merkel telephoned President Obama to protest the breach of her trust and demanded explanations.³¹ She said that “spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany.”³² The Brazilian and Chinese governments took similar stances with regard to NSA activities and demanded apologies; they viewed the surveillance as violations of “their sovereignties” and the “human rights of their\n24.

Charter (prohibition on the use of force in other states) should be interpreted as including cyberespionage.⁴⁰ Similarly, Alexander Melnitzky also believes that the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter does include cyberespionage, because data thefts in cyberespionage entails detrimental effects on the peace and security of nations.⁴¹\n## B.

Counter-Terrorism Implementation Taskforce (CTITF) defines cyberterrorism as “terrorist attacks by remotely altering information on a computer system or disrupting the flow of data between computer systems.”44 An example of computer system controlling infrastructure is the Supervisory Control and Data system (SCADA), which monitors and controls traffic systems, railroad switches, gas and electricity distribution networks, and water purification plants.45 The unauthorized use of SCADA by hacking can be considered cyberterrorism.46\nGeneral international laws47—prohibiting states from intervening in other states, using force, and launching terrorist activities from their states—are, by using the principle of state responsibility, flexible enough to incorporate a prohibition on cyberterrorism.48 For instance, there have been discussions on a prohibition on using force and armed attack in other states, and on whether the use of force in self-defense encompasses cyberterrorism.49 Specifically, more serious cyberattacks by state militaries against other states without an armed conflict come under the prohibition on the use of force.50 Likewise, instruments of national and regional51 laws also incorporate prohibition on the offense undertaken by cyber means, such as fraud, extortion, terrorism, stalking attacks on information systems, and misuse of computers.52 The Association of South East Asian Nationals (ASEAN) Convention on Counter Terrorism (2007)\n43.

The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴\nSaul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general\n53.

Cyberoperations\nWhistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange have revealed to the world that cyberwarfare/cyberoperations are currently the biggest threat⁷⁶ to governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. Under these activities using cyberspace, governments and corporations⁷⁷ are proactively and preventively monitoring,⁷⁸ collecting, and investigating⁷⁹ data of all the aforementioned subjects. For instance, corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and AOL are collecting and monitoring the data⁸⁰ of its users for economic profit, for future business aspects, and to collaborate with intelligence services.⁸¹ Owing to the deep analytical artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of Google, fueled by the data of all its users regarding their political proclivities, likes and dislikes, daily routines, and query searches, it is said that Google knows an individual more than that individual knows themselves.⁸²\nWarlike cyberoperations and cyber activities are often referred to as cyberattacks, and their militarization under the patronage of intelligence agencies is characterized as cyberwarfare.⁸³ Cyberwarfare is defined by Michael Schmitt as the “employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving [military] objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”⁸⁴ The Netherlands has defined cyberwarfare as “the conduct of military operations to disrupt, mislead, modify or destroy an opponent’s computer systems or networks by means of cyber capabilities.”⁸⁵ The United Kingdom’s (UK’s) view is that “cyber warfare can enable actors to achieve their political and strategic goals without the need for armed conflict.”⁸⁶ Schmitt’s definition generally focuses on the use of cyberspace\n76.

It is divided into two sections: Section A will discuss the notions of “cyberspace” and “national jurisdiction” in relation to cyberattacks, and Section B will discuss the concept of “state responsibility” with regard to cyberattacks.\n## A. Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction\nCyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹\nFrom an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself. Sovereignty is a body of rights attributed to state territory in relation\n¹²⁶. David P.

For example, in an English court, a U.S. publisher was convicted for publishing obscenity and violating the obscenity laws of the U.K.¹⁴⁹ In a German court, a Dutch seller was convicted of selling drugs online and violating German laws, even though the drug concerned was legal in the Netherlands, because the “origin rule” didn’t apply here owing to the protection of public health.¹⁵⁰ Similarly, an English defendant was held liable in a Dutch court for violating Dutch license laws that prohibited making a gambling site accessible in the Netherlands.¹⁵¹ An Australian court also found an American site guilty of defamation caused in Australia despite being in a U.S. publication,¹⁵² and the same approach was taken by an English court against Harrods Ltd.¹⁵³ Similarly, an English court held Google responsible for collecting the data of English residents without their consent;¹⁵⁴ later, Spain took a similar approach against Google for violating data protection laws.¹⁵⁵ For data protection, states like Iran and China have completely banned certain websites including Facebook and YouTube.¹⁵⁶\nOn the other hand, Johnson and Post propose that cyberspace should not be subject to sovereignty and must be self-regulating.¹⁵⁷ However, cyberspace cannot be considered sovereign itself, because it does not have any central authority to make and enforce laws, and it does not have its\n147.

State Responsibility\nState responsibility is a principle of international law¹⁶³ that includes acts or omissions attributable to a state and breaches of obligations under international law.¹⁶⁴ These breaches can be undertaken by groups, organizations, or individual beings on behalf of a state.¹⁶⁵ First, it should be seen whether the action or omission is undertaken by the organs of a state. If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that\n158.

For instance, Germany accused the U.K. and the United States of violating international law by using their embassies in Berlin for international cybersurveillance.¹⁷⁷ Similarly, a number of U.S. embassies in Asia and Europe collected the data of their host states.¹⁷⁸ In such cases, there is a possibility that accused states could deny liability because they used proxies to undertake such attacks.¹⁷⁹ Therefore, in cyberspace cases, victim states are allowed a more liberal procedure to infer evidential circumstances.¹⁸⁰ For example, the climate of political relationships may allow some insight in sudden cyberattacks, with a reverse burden of proof allowed.¹⁸¹ Since the attribution laws are a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks, there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy for other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.¹⁸²\n169.

Examples of such acts are surveillance and espionage by state organs or individuals from other states.¹⁸³ However, espionage is not prohibited under international law, and some further proof of damage to another state is required to establish a breach of an international obligation in cyberspace.¹⁸⁴ Nevertheless, where something is not mentioned in international law, that does not mean that something is entirely permissible; in fact, no state claims that espionage is a lawful act.¹⁸⁵ In some cases, the concept of attribution is inapplicable, where de facto organs/agents of states and concerns of failures to act are involved; here, the notion of due diligence is applicable.¹⁸⁶ Article 14 of ARS explicitly includes instances of failing to act, with reference to state responsibility, because the state is responsible for preventing all crimes emanating from its territories, if there is a persistent risk of it reoccurring.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, states cannot knowingly allow their territory to be used to violate international law, and they must take reasonable steps to prevent such activities.¹⁸⁸\n## IV.

LAW\n[Vol. 28]\njus cogens.²⁰⁷ There are only two exceptions to this principle: the use of force in self-defense²⁰⁸ and the use of force with the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## B. Use of Force\nCyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the\n207.

OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW\n[Vol. 28]\nStates,²²³ Mali,²²⁴ and Russia²²⁵ view cyberattacks disrupting the critical infrastructure of a country as the use of force against the sovereign victim state. The main critique of this interpretation is that the use of force in these attacks is not armed force²²⁶ (this approach is known as the instrumental approach, which is discussed in Section IV.B.5 below).²²⁷ This perspective argues that, instead of armed force, such use of force should be considered to be within the realms of “economic and political coercion.”²²⁸\n## 1. Economic and Political Coercions\nThe wording of the U.N. Charter prohibits the “use of force.”²²⁹ This use of force includes intention to coerce and use of weapons.²³⁰ The Eastern countries have repeatedly asked for economic and political coercions to be included within the meaning of the use of force.²³¹ For instance, the Brazilian government proposed including coercion by economic means in the realms of Article 2(4), though this was rejected.²³² The view of David Harris²³³ and the Belgian delegates²³⁴ is that the rejection of the Brazilian proposal does not prove that Article 2(4) does not include other forms of coercion. However, the prevailing and the Western²³⁵ view is that the wording of the “use of force” is limited to include “armed force,”²³⁶ given the fact that the wording of the U.N.\n223.

Charter.²⁴⁵ The inclusion of cyberattacks under economic and political coercions is flawed because the latter employs the economy as a weapon to pressure states by political and diplomatic means, and the former uses malware direct attacks as instruments to destroy targeted structures.²⁴⁶ Roscini questions why, when a kinetic bomb employed to destroy a financial institution is surely an armed attack, the same result by cyberattacks and the use of another weapon of choice should be considered any less.²⁴⁷\n237.

LAW\n[Vol. 28]\nThe UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allotting a naval blockade.²⁴⁸ The ICJ also established that arming and training armed groups is a use of force.²⁴⁹ And if we look at the intention of the drafters and history of developing the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force, it is clear that it has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances;²⁵⁰ it was drafted to stop aggression against other states.²⁵¹ Ian Brownlie concluded that the Kellogg-Briand Pact was intended to prohibit any use of substantial armed force.²⁵² In attempts to clarify the meaning of the use of force in the U.N. Charter, states have struggled to define it through UNGA resolutions but have failed to attain consensus.²⁵³ The Organization of American States Charter includes economic and political coercions separately from the use of armed force,²⁵⁴ to clarify that there is no relation between the use of force and other coercive measures. Richard Aldrich and Tom Farer conclude that the general prohibition on economic and political coercion under the OAS Charter are unenforceable,²⁵⁵ because it even outlaws all diplomatic measures by deeming them political coercion.²⁵⁶ Similar to the OAS Charter, the U.K. also believes that political and economic coercion should not be treated under the principle of prohibition on the use of force, but instead threats to political independence and sovereignty within such coercion should be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention in other states.²⁵⁷ For these reasons, all types of coercions should be seen as different from the use of force.²⁵⁸\n248.

Result-Based Approach\nScholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also\n---\n286.

Target-Based Approach\nThe target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³\n## 5. Instrument-Based Approach\nThis approach argues that only the use of traditional or conventional weapons can amount to the use of force, and cyberattacks can never be considered the use of force even in cases where it causes physical damage, because it merely uses computer coding in cyberspace instead of kinetic weapons.³¹⁴ Scholars believe that such an approach is “ill-suited” for\n306.

LAW\n[Vol. 28]\nanalyzing cyberattacks,³¹⁵ and the weapon of choice can be anything ranging from ordinary household tools³¹⁶ to nonkinetic energy weapons.³¹⁷ For instance, the ICJ accepted that assistance to armed bands could amount to the use of force, because enabling people to use force is itself a use of force.³¹⁸ One should not focus on the weapon of choice or the mechanism employed, but rather see the consequences.³¹⁹ For example, an analogy of a murder case will suffice to prove that the instrument-based approach is ill-suited for analyzing the use of force under the U.N. Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹\n## 6. Contextualist Approach\nThe contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or\n315.

Positivist Approach\nIn the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force.\n³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks\nDinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks\n333.

Armed Attack and Self-Defense\nArmed attacks are the uses of force by armed bands, with sufficient gravity of scale and effect beyond mere frontier skirmishes.³⁵² The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allocating a naval blockade.³⁵³ ICJ also established that “arming and training armed groups” is also a use\n344.

Lesser forms of the use of force with cyberattacks do violate the principle of nonintervention and the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore, a victim state can either take proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council to take appropriate measures against the aggressor state.³⁷⁴\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThough the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹\n³⁷⁴. *Id.*\n³⁷⁵.

INTRODUCTION Globally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks.\nIn this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## II. THREATS\nThis Part will explain the severity and nature of threats posed by cyberattacks by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. It is divided into three sections: Section A will discuss espionage using cyberattacks as a threat to nations; Section B will discuss terrorism through cyberattacks as a threat; and Section C will discuss other cyberoperations employed by aggressive states against victim states.\n### A. Espionage\nThe prevalence⁹ of cyberespionage is emerging as a threat to the peace and security of the world. Currently, the Internet or cyberspace is considered a “gift from God” for surveillance and espionage purposes,¹⁰ and this age has been called a “golden age for espionage.”¹¹ In cyberespionage, unauthorized states and nonstate actors infiltrate computer information systems to collect confidential information.¹² Cyberespionage can be defined as “[o]perations and related programs or activities conducted . . . in or through cyberspace, for the primary purpose of collecting intelligence . . . from, computers, information or communication systems, or networks, with the intent to remain\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] undetected.\"¹³ Cyberespionage is distinguished from the normal hacking of computers by its element of accessing and copying¹⁴ confidential data by exploiting cyberspace.¹⁵ It can violate international obligations and national laws.¹⁶ More specifically, it violates the basic principle of equal sovereignty among states¹⁷ and breaches the prohibition of using force and intervening in other states.¹⁸ Thus, it threatens the peace and security of the world.¹⁹ For instance, in 2010, Google alleged that Chinese hackers gained access to the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.²⁰ Similarly, in 2012, the Russian Kaspersky Lab (a security firm) detected the Flame virus emanating from the United States and Israel, which accessed, monitored, and collected the confidential data of Iranian oil companies.²¹ In another example of cyberespionage, China also hacked and copied terabytes of data regarding F-35 fighter jets from the server of the company Lockheed Martin.²² The United States protested that this activity was a threat to U.S. national and international peace and security.²³ Reports such as the Mandiant Report of 2013 show that there is a unit in the Chinese Liberation Army known as “Unit 61398,” which acts as an instrument of state and is tasked with undertaking massive espionage 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J.

LAW [Vol. 28] citizens.”³³ China remonstrated that NSA activities were so severe that they should be rejected and condemned by the collective international community.³⁴ Since, according to the Nicaragua case, the principle of non-intervention is a part of customary international law,³⁵ the use of espionage violates sovereignty, political integrity,³⁶ and the principle of non-intervention in other states.³⁷ United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 66/24 (2011) establishes that “[s]overeignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to state conduct of ICT-related activities.”³⁸ The U.N. secretary-general substantiated this UNGA proposition by anchoring “ICT security in the existing framework of international law and understandings that govern state relations and provide the foundation for international peace and security.”³⁹ Russell Buchan argues that cyberespionage can cause massive damage to other states by disrupting governmental activities and banking systems; therefore, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter (prohibition on the use of force in other states) should be interpreted as including cyberespionage.⁴⁰ Similarly, Alexander Melnitzky also believes that the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter does include cyberespionage, because data thefts in cyberespionage entails detrimental effects on the peace and security of nations.⁴¹ ## B. Terrorism Cyberterrorism refers to attacks using electronic means such as computing devices to harm computer systems or physical infrastructure dependent on such computer systems.⁴² It is defined by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime as the “deliberate exploitation of computer 2019] CYBERWARFARE General international laws47—prohibiting states from intervening in other states, using force, and launching terrorist activities from their states—are, by using the principle of state responsibility, flexible enough to incorporate a prohibition on cyberterrorism.48 For instance, there have been discussions on a prohibition on using force and armed attack in other states, and on whether the use of force in self-defense encompasses cyberterrorism.49 Specifically, more serious cyberattacks by state militaries against other states without an armed conflict come under the prohibition on the use of force.50 Likewise, instruments of national and regional51 laws also incorporate prohibition on the offense undertaken by cyber means, such as fraud, extortion, terrorism, stalking attacks on information systems, and misuse of computers.52 The Association of South East Asian Nationals (ASEAN) Convention on Counter Terrorism (2007) TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] unequivocally incorporates cooperation among states against cyberterrorism.⁵³ In general, when we are discussing cyberterrorism, this is different from other organized crimes, because the inclusion of the term “terrorism” entails that the activities have an element of “political”⁵⁴ motive attached to them. The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴ Saul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] ## C. Cyberoperations Whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange have revealed to the world that cyberwarfare/cyberoperations are currently the biggest threat⁷⁶ to governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. Under these activities using cyberspace, governments and corporations⁷⁷ are proactively and preventively monitoring,⁷⁸ collecting, and investigating⁷⁹ data of all the aforementioned subjects. For instance, corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and AOL are collecting and monitoring the data⁸⁰ of its users for economic profit, for future business aspects, and to collaborate with intelligence services.⁸¹ Owing to the deep analytical artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of Google, fueled by the data of all its users regarding their political proclivities, likes and dislikes, daily routines, and query searches, it is said that Google knows an individual more than that individual knows themselves.⁸² Warlike cyberoperations and cyber activities are often referred to as cyberattacks, and their militarization under the patronage of intelligence agencies is characterized as cyberwarfare.⁸³ Cyberwarfare is defined by Michael Schmitt as the “employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving [military] objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”⁸⁴ The Netherlands has defined cyberwarfare as “the conduct of military operations to disrupt, mislead, modify or destroy an opponent’s computer systems or networks by means of cyber capabilities.”⁸⁵ The United Kingdom’s (UK’s) view is that “cyber warfare can enable actors to achieve their political and strategic goals without the need for armed conflict.”⁸⁶ Schmitt’s definition generally focuses on the use of cyberspace 2019] CYBERWARFARE In nature, cyberwarfare can be proactive, aggressive, preventive, or defensive⁹⁰ and can perform the strategic functions of deterrence, prevention, aggression, intervention, stabilization, and normalization.⁹¹ From a state-centric viewpoint, cyberoperations are undertaken to protect national security and achieve political/geopolitical interests.⁹² From the perspective of corporations, cyber activities by the likes of Facebook, Google, Kaspersky, and Symantec are undertaken purely for economic benefit.⁹³ By contrast, activist NGOs including Anonymous,⁹⁴ the TOR Project, WikiLeaks, and Bits of Freedom have ideological and political goals.⁹⁵ The increasing use of the “Internet of Things” since the events of 9/11 and the resultant rise of terrorist threats has led to increased cyber surveillance by states.⁹⁶ The dilemma is to choose between the public’s right to privacy and the security of the state’s political agendas,⁹⁷ which balances necessity, effectiveness, and human rights with regard to cyberoperations.⁹⁸ In this regard, Paul Ducheine has identified five major paradigms in the state’s cybersecurity framework: (1) Internet governance and diplomacy, (2) protection, (3) law enforcement, (4) intelligence and counterintelligence, and (5) military operations.⁹⁹ Under “Internet TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] governance¹⁰⁰ and diplomacy,¹⁰¹ cyberoperations are mainly proactive and preventive, shaping governance in cyberspace,¹⁰² keeping in mind the state’s security interests and strategies.¹⁰³ In the framework of “protection,” cyber activities by states are focused on protecting the integral infrastructure of state organs, such as guarding electricity, water, and military infrastructure,¹⁰⁴ and fighting malware viruses and other unauthorized intrusions in the systems.¹⁰⁵ For “law enforcement,” cyber activities are an amalgam of private and public operations at national and international levels¹⁰⁶ to investigate conduct, penalize crimes, take repressive measures, and enhance prosecution and policing.¹⁰⁷ In “intelligence and counterintelligence,” states undertake security operations, surveillance,¹⁰⁸ espionage,¹⁰⁹ and counterthreats.¹¹⁰ Intelligence agencies are allowed by their respective states to “exploit the information for other purposes, or directly intervene in order to prevent threats from reoccurring.”¹¹¹ The use of the Stuxnet virus is an example of proactive and aggressive operation by intelligence agencies for military purposes.¹¹² Finally, military operations under the cyberoperations of a state are undertaken to serve political interests, state strategies, and military objectives,¹¹³ by disrupting, destroying, or misleading an opponent’s networks and computer systems,¹¹⁴ for deterrence, 2019] CYBERWARFARE Examples of cyberwarfare include intelligence, counterintelligence, and military cyberoperations. For instance in domestic cyberoperations, Dutch intelligence agencies are legally entitled through a 2002 Act¹¹⁷ to intercept, search, and store data of telecommunications and hack computer systems.¹¹⁸ Aggressive international cyberoperations, such as the Stuxnet virus of 2010 and the Estonia attacks of 2007, made the world realize that the security of critical infrastructure is important,¹¹⁹ because international cyberoperations can disrupt societies.¹²⁰ In a joint collaborative cyberwarfare operation in 2010, the United States and Israel partnered to target Iranian nuclear facilities with the Stuxnet virus.¹²¹ Even though the Iranian system was not connected to the Internet, making cyber intrusion very difficult, Stuxnet was successful in sabotaging the Iranian “Industrial Control System.”¹²² Another example of aggressive intelligence and military operation is the cyberwarfare against Syria.¹²³ In 2007, cyberattacks by Israel used coding and tooling to trick the Syrian air defense system into not noticing invading Israeli fighter jets targeting Syrian nuclear facilities at al Kibar.¹²⁴ The governing principles of international law, including the notion of sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention (prohibition on the use of force), are violated by proactive/aggressive cyber military operations/cyberwarfare targeting other states.¹²⁵ Cyberoperations may also violate trade law, private TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] international law, and public international law,¹²⁶ in addition to the laws of using force.\n## III. KEY CONCEPTS This Part will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international law that are applicable to cyberattacks. It is divided into two sections: Section A will discuss the notions of “cyberspace” and “national jurisdiction” in relation to cyberattacks, and Section B will discuss the concept of “state responsibility” with regard to cyberattacks.\n## A. Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction Cyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹ From an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself. Sovereignty is a body of rights attributed to state territory in relation ¹²⁶. David P.

For example, in an English court, a U.S. publisher was convicted for publishing obscenity and violating the obscenity laws of the U.K.¹⁴⁹ In a German court, a Dutch seller was convicted of selling drugs online and violating German laws, even though the drug concerned was legal in the Netherlands, because the “origin rule” didn’t apply here owing to the protection of public health.¹⁵⁰ Similarly, an English defendant was held liable in a Dutch court for violating Dutch license laws that prohibited making a gambling site accessible in the Netherlands.¹⁵¹ An Australian court also found an American site guilty of defamation caused in Australia despite being in a U.S. publication,¹⁵² and the same approach was taken by an English court against Harrods Ltd.¹⁵³ Similarly, an English court held Google responsible for collecting the data of English residents without their consent;¹⁵⁴ later, Spain took a similar approach against Google for violating data protection laws.¹⁵⁵ For data protection, states like Iran and China have completely banned certain websites including Facebook and YouTube.¹⁵⁶ On the other hand, Johnson and Post propose that cyberspace should not be subject to sovereignty and must be self-regulating.¹⁵⁷ However, cyberspace cannot be considered sovereign itself, because it does not have any central authority to make and enforce laws, and it does not have its 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## B. State Responsibility\nState responsibility is a principle of international law¹⁶³ that includes acts or omissions attributable to a state and breaches of obligations under international law.¹⁶⁴ These breaches can be undertaken by groups, organizations, or individual beings on behalf of a state.¹⁶⁵ First, it should be seen whether the action or omission is undertaken by the organs of a state. If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] individual criminal responsibility should be applied.¹⁶⁹ However, the Articles on the Responsibility for States (ARS) do recognize exceptions for state responsibility for nonviolations of international law in cases involving distress,¹⁷⁰ self-defense,¹⁷¹ necessity,¹⁷² force majeure,¹⁷³ countermeasures¹⁷⁴ and consent.¹⁷⁵ The notion of sovereignty under state responsibility entails that it should control all the illicit cyber activities emanating from its infrastructure and computer activities.¹⁷⁶ However, in cyberspace, the attribution of state responsibility in violation of international law is difficult. For instance, Germany accused the U.K. and the United States of violating international law by using their embassies in Berlin for international cybersurveillance.¹⁷⁷ Similarly, a number of U.S. embassies in Asia and Europe collected the data of their host states.¹⁷⁸ In such cases, there is a possibility that accused states could deny liability because they used proxies to undertake such attacks.¹⁷⁹ Therefore, in cyberspace cases, victim states are allowed a more liberal procedure to infer evidential circumstances.¹⁸⁰ For example, the climate of political relationships may allow some insight in sudden cyberattacks, with a reverse burden of proof allowed.¹⁸¹ Since the attribution laws are a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks, there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy for other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.¹⁸² 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## IV. JUS AD BELLUM\nThis Part will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks. It will start by exploring the criteria by which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force,” while providing relevant definitions, *opinio juris*, and legal analyses on the subject. Then, it will analyze whether cyberattacks can be viewed as “armed attacks” and whether they can give rise to the right to self-defense. This Part is divided into three sections: Section A will provide a brief contextual analysis of the use of force and the international laws with regard to cyberwarfare; Section B will define the notion of the “use of force” in relation to cyberattacks, and\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] provide criteria for the circumstances in which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force.” Section B will also try to analyze whether cyberattacks can be considered “economic and political coercion.” It will attempt to provide the *opinio juris* of some key players in the international community on the consideration of cyberattacks as the “use of force.” Furthermore, it will examine different approaches to see the legality of cyberattacks under the laws of using force: the “result-based approach,” the “target-based approach,” the “instrument-based approach,” the “contextualist approach,” and the “positivist approach.” Section C will discuss the notions of “armed attack” and “self-defense” in relation to cyberattacks.\n## A. Contextual Analysis The Estonia attack of 2007 is an example of a cyberattack in which distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in Estonia.¹⁸⁹ Though there was no physical damage to infrastructure, tens of millions of euros in damage were caused by this cyberattack.¹⁹⁰ Initially, Estonia accused the Russian government of conducting these attacks,¹⁹¹ but it later retracted its stance to accuse the Kremlin of these damages¹⁹²—a Kremlin-based group of youths admitted responsibility—and acknowledged that the Russian government had no hand in the attacks.¹⁹³ Likewise, in 2010, the Stuxnet virus (a cyberattack), orchestrated by state-backed professionals, targeted Iran’s “industrial control system,”¹⁹⁴ targeting 2019] CYBERWARFARE Generally, states²⁰³ and international organizations²⁰⁴ are reluctant to view cyberattacks as armed attacks. So the question remains whether cyberattacks can be considered to be the use of force against other states, in the sense of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which explicitly prohibits all states from using force against other states.²⁰⁵ The prohibition on the use of force is a part of customary international law²⁰⁶ and is considered TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] jus cogens.²⁰⁷ There are only two exceptions to this principle: the use of force in self-defense²⁰⁸ and the use of force with the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## B. Use of Force Cyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] States,²²³ Mali,²²⁴ and Russia²²⁵ view cyberattacks disrupting the critical infrastructure of a country as the use of force against the sovereign victim state. The main critique of this interpretation is that the use of force in these attacks is not armed force²²⁶ (this approach is known as the instrumental approach, which is discussed in Section IV.B.5 below).²²⁷ This perspective argues that, instead of armed force, such use of force should be considered to be within the realms of “economic and political coercion.”²²⁸ ## 1. Economic and Political Coercions The wording of the U.N. Charter prohibits the “use of force.”²²⁹ This use of force includes intention to coerce and use of weapons.²³⁰ The Eastern countries have repeatedly asked for economic and political coercions to be included within the meaning of the use of force.²³¹ For instance, the Brazilian government proposed including coercion by economic means in the realms of Article 2(4), though this was rejected.²³² The view of David Harris²³³ and the Belgian delegates²³⁴ is that the rejection of the Brazilian proposal does not prove that Article 2(4) does not include other forms of coercion. However, the prevailing and the Western²³⁵ view is that the wording of the “use of force” is limited to include “armed force,”²³⁶ given the fact that the wording of the U.N.\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Bond believes that the term “use of force” is only relatable to the traditional/conventional use of weapons.²⁴² Roscini also concludes that the prohibition on the use of force does not include economic and political coercions, because they do not include weapons, which is implied under Article 41.²⁴³ Therefore, the United States argues that other forms of aggression, such as political and economic coercions, can be covered as a threat to international peace and security under Article 39²⁴⁴ of the U.N. Charter.²⁴⁵ The inclusion of cyberattacks under economic and political coercions is flawed because the latter employs the economy as a weapon to pressure states by political and diplomatic means, and the former uses malware direct attacks as instruments to destroy targeted structures.²⁴⁶ Roscini questions why, when a kinetic bomb employed to destroy a financial institution is surely an armed attack, the same result by cyberattacks and the use of another weapon of choice should be considered any less.²⁴⁷ TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allotting a naval blockade.²⁴⁸ The ICJ also established that arming and training armed groups is a use of force.²⁴⁹ And if we look at the intention of the drafters and history of developing the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force, it is clear that it has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances;²⁵⁰ it was drafted to stop aggression against other states.²⁵¹ Ian Brownlie concluded that the Kellogg-Briand Pact was intended to prohibit any use of substantial armed force.²⁵² In attempts to clarify the meaning of the use of force in the U.N. Charter, states have struggled to define it through UNGA resolutions but have failed to attain consensus.²⁵³ The Organization of American States Charter includes economic and political coercions separately from the use of armed force,²⁵⁴ to clarify that there is no relation between the use of force and other coercive measures. Richard Aldrich and Tom Farer conclude that the general prohibition on economic and political coercion under the OAS Charter are unenforceable,²⁵⁵ because it even outlaws all diplomatic measures by deeming them political coercion.²⁵⁶ Similar to the OAS Charter, the U.K. also believes that political and economic coercion should not be treated under the principle of prohibition on the use of force, but instead threats to political independence and sovereignty within such coercion should be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention in other states.²⁵⁷ For these reasons, all types of coercions should be seen as different from the use of force.²⁵⁸ 2019] CYBERWARFARE Since the prohibition on the use of force was adopted before the electronic age of information, it can be applied to cyberattacks.²⁵⁹ Countries including China,²⁶⁰ Hungary,²⁶¹ Australia,²⁶² Cuba,²⁶³ Italy,²⁶⁴ Iran,²⁶⁵ the Russian Federation, Mali,²⁶⁶ U.K.,²⁶⁷ Qatar,²⁶⁸ the Netherlands,²⁶⁹ and the United States,²⁷⁰ as well as the European Union,²⁷¹ believe that the prohibition on the use of force does include cyberattacks. Russia is of the view that cyberattacks are a use of force, similar to the use of weapons of mass destruction.²⁷² It noted that, from a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.²⁷³ Belarus also considers cyberattacks to be equivalent to weapons of mass destruction.²⁷⁴ Kazakhstan noted that ICT weapons can be used during TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] armed conflicts.²⁷⁵ Cuba stated that ICT weapons can cause destruction to critical national infrastructure (CNI) and can threaten the peace and security of the world.²⁷⁶ Spain made an analogy similar to the Cuban stance.²⁷⁷ Canada, the U.K., Australia, India, France, New Zealand, and Germany have been the victims of large- and small-scale cyberattacks, but none has treated cyberattacks as the use of force against their land.²⁷⁸ Instead, they have treated cyberwarfare to be the equivalent of cyberespionage.²⁷⁹ China has also been a victim of massive cyberattacks, which have compromised its military secrets and caused damage to the state;²⁸⁰ thus far, China has also not formally published any statement that treats cyberattacks as the use of force.²⁸¹ The U.S. policy against cyberattacks is to pursue defensive and preemptive counter-cyberattacks targeting the computer systems of perpetrators with military means,²⁸² but it is not clear whether the United States considers cyberattacks to be the use of force. The international community is reluctant to treat cyberattacks as the use of force because, with the exception of one attack—the Farewell Dossier²⁸³—none of the attacks have caused human injury.²⁸⁴ It is pertinent to note here that the United States includes the employment of non-kinetic weapons and information operations within its vision,²⁸⁵ and the U.K.\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Based on the *opinio juris* of U.N. members, the UNGA report of 2013 on the inclusion of cyberattacks within the realm of the prohibition on the use of force concluded that “international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [Information and Communications Technologies] environment.”²⁸⁷ For such application, however, cyberattacks need to meet three main criteria: (1) The cyberattack must be attributable to a state; (2) the cyberattack must be equivalent to the use or threat of force, which is armed force capable of causing the destruction of property or life; and (3) the cyberattack must be international in nature (taking place across borders), where one state is targeting another.²⁸⁸ In addition, any cyberattack that produces the same results that a conventional kinetic energy weapon does can be considered the use of armed force.²⁸⁹ ## 3. Result-Based Approach Scholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also --- TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] considers that the use of force must cause some sort of human injury.²⁹⁶ Under this presumption, the vast majority of cyberattacks, which do not cause any sort of destruction, can never be considered the use of force.²⁹⁷ Brownlie argues that, for instance, though biological and chemical weapons do not employ kinetic force, because they can cause the destruction of property and life, they can still easily be considered a weapon.²⁹⁸ This kind of analysis of consequences is known as the result-based perspective.²⁹⁹ Under this perspective, Cassandra LaRae-Perez argues that long-term economic sanctions can cause a lot of damage to both property and human life, in a similar way to other weapons using kinetic energy, and thus sanctions should also be considered the use of force under the aegis of Article 2(4).³⁰⁰ However, the economic embargos that caused massive destruction such as the embargos on Cuba and Arab states, by the United States and Israel, respectively, were never treated by the international community as the use of force.³⁰¹ Therefore, Schmitt maintains that quantifying direct destruction caused by economic coercion is a difficult task.³⁰² Nonetheless, Heather Dinniss counterargues that cyberattacks using non-kinetic force, causing destruction of property, should not, from a legal perspective, be differentiated from other forms of use of force, using a result-based approach.³⁰³ This result-based approach is the prevailing and the most acceptable approach, judging the characteristics of armed forces by analyzing the destruction it causes to property and human beings.³⁰⁴ Therefore, the cyberattacks should not be viewed as any less than other weapons used in armed conflicts.³⁰⁵ The HPCR Manual endorses cyberattacks, computer codes, malware, and their associated components as being considered means of warfare and accepts that destruction can be 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## 4. Target-Based Approach\nThe target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³\n## 5. Instrument-Based Approach\nThis approach argues that only the use of traditional or conventional weapons can amount to the use of force, and cyberattacks can never be considered the use of force even in cases where it causes physical damage, because it merely uses computer coding in cyberspace instead of kinetic weapons.³¹⁴ Scholars believe that such an approach is “ill-suited” for\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] analyzing cyberattacks,³¹⁵ and the weapon of choice can be anything ranging from ordinary household tools³¹⁶ to nonkinetic energy weapons.³¹⁷ For instance, the ICJ accepted that assistance to armed bands could amount to the use of force, because enabling people to use force is itself a use of force.³¹⁸ One should not focus on the weapon of choice or the mechanism employed, but rather see the consequences.³¹⁹ For example, an analogy of a murder case will suffice to prove that the instrument-based approach is ill-suited for analyzing the use of force under the U.N. Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹ ## 6. Contextualist Approach The contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## 7. Positivist Approach\nIn the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force.\n³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks\nDinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Therefore, Dinniss concludes that the tangibility of weapon of choice is irrelevant in considering whether cyberattacks can be considered the use of force.³⁴⁸ Instead, she believes that the severity of damage caused in terms of destruction to property and human lives by cyberattacks determines whether the attack is a use of force or not.³⁴⁹ For instance, if the physical results of a cyberattack are minimal, it cannot be considered a use of force, and if its results are grave, then it can be considered a use of force.³⁵⁰ But this does not establish that lesser consequences by cyberattacks are permissible by the principle of international law; less-serious cyberattacks may still violate the principle of non-intervention and the principle of sovereignty and can still be considered a threat to international peace and security.³⁵¹ ## C. Armed Attack and Self-Defense Armed attacks are the uses of force by armed bands, with sufficient gravity of scale and effect beyond mere frontier skirmishes.³⁵² The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allocating a naval blockade.³⁵³ ICJ also established that “arming and training armed groups” is also a use TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] of force.³⁵⁴ The use of force in self-defense is allowed against a more serious use of force amounting to an armed attack; a lesser form of armed attack is still an illegal use of force but does not create a right to use force in self-defense.³⁵⁵ This scale of using force from lesser forms to graver forms is mainly to maintain the peace of the world.³⁵⁶ However, there are two kinds of scholars: those who interpret the right to self-defense expansively and those who interpret it narrowly.³⁵⁷ Scholars also argue that victim states have the right to take responsive measures even in response to lesser forms of force in a proportional manner.³⁵⁸ For instance, in an expansive view, in the *Oil Platform* case, Judge Simma argued that victim states should not be forced to not defend themselves against the use of force against them, because the principle of proportionality is able to contain escalation of incidents.³⁵⁹ Russia also takes an expansive view when dealing with the right to self-defense in cyberattacks, because it doesn't differentiate between graver and lesser forms of armed attack.³⁶⁰ The United States takes a narrow view for dealing with the right to self-defense in cyberattacks.³⁶¹ It said that, if a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge the victim nation if it concluded that it was a victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.³⁶² Schmitt is of the narrow view; he says that, in cases of cyberattacks where the intentions of the perpetrators is to cause the destruction of property or human life (armed attacks that threaten the stability and peace of the world), the right to self-defense is permissible.³⁶³ On the other hand, Sharp, from an expansive view, believes that right to self-defense and the 2019] CYBERWARFARE On theoretical grounds, Dinniss shares the narrow interpretation, which allows the use of responsive force only in situations of grave forms of armed force.[367] In this approach, most cyberattacks—even those that cause damage to property or human life as lesser forms of use of force—do not amount to armed attacks; therefore, there is no right to self-defense against them.[368] For instance, the cyberattacks in Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet virus in 2010 did cause damage to intrinsic government properties and can be considered uses of force.[369] But, since the gravity of the destruction they caused was moderate, they did not amount to an armed attack and did not give rise to the right to the responsive use of force in self-defense.[370] However, there remains a question of attribution in cyberattacks, since most cyberattacks cannot be attributed to a state and are conducted by nonstate actors, and there is no right to self-defense against the use of force by nonstate actors until and unless their actions are attributable to a state.[371] Similarly, for all cyberattacks, if attribution to a state is not conclusive, there is no right to self-defense against any cyberwarfare.[372] In conclusion, the defensive use of force against cyberattacks is only permissible in cases that amount to an equivalent damage of an armed attack, which entails a graver form of the use of force, with the severe effects and scale of destruction of property and human life.[373] However, this Article concludes that, even in lesser forms of the use of force with TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] cyberattacks that can destroy property or human life, a victim state has the right to self-defense, and the right to employ similar and proportionate use of force, be it in the form of responsive cyberattacks or by claiming rightful sovereignty and political independence. Lesser forms of the use of force with cyberattacks do violate the principle of nonintervention and the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore, a victim state can either take proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council to take appropriate measures against the aggressor state.³⁷⁴ ## V. CONCLUSION Though the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹ ³⁷⁴. *Id.* ³⁷⁵.

    "I. INTRODUCTION": "Globally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks.\nIn this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?\n1.

(3) What are the applicable international laws that can regulate or prevent cyberattacks? For these purposes, this Article is divided into three main Parts. Part II will explain the severity and nature of the threats posed by cyberattacks, by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. Part III will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international laws applicable to cyberattacks. Part IV will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks.",
    "II. THREATS": "This Part will explain the severity and nature of threats posed by cyberattacks by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. It is divided into three sections: Section A will discuss espionage using cyberattacks as a threat to nations; Section B will discuss terrorism through cyberattacks as a threat; and Section C will discuss other cyberoperations employed by aggressive states against victim states.\n### A. Espionage\nThe prevalence⁹ of cyberespionage is emerging as a threat to the peace and security of the world. Currently, the Internet or cyberspace is considered a “gift from God” for surveillance and espionage purposes,¹⁰ and this age has been called a “golden age for espionage.”¹¹ In cyberespionage, unauthorized states and nonstate actors infiltrate computer information systems to collect confidential information.¹² Cyberespionage can be defined as “[o]perations and related programs or activities conducted . . . in or through cyberspace, for the primary purpose of collecting intelligence . . . from, computers, information or communication systems, or networks, with the intent to remain\n9.

General Assembly, and he cancelled his scheduled meetings with the United States.²⁶ He said that the NSA had violated international law,²⁷ the sovereignty of the Brazilian nation, and the fundamental human rights of its citizens.²⁸ In regard to NSA leaked documents, The Guardian established that Angela Merkel’s activities had been monitored for more than a decade.²⁹ Such activity can be seen as a breach of the German state’s sovereignty.³⁰ In response, Merkel telephoned President Obama to protest the breach of her trust and demanded explanations.³¹ She said that “spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany.”³² The Brazilian and Chinese governments took similar stances with regard to NSA activities and demanded apologies; they viewed the surveillance as violations of “their sovereignties” and the “human rights of their\n24.

Charter (prohibition on the use of force in other states) should be interpreted as including cyberespionage.⁴⁰ Similarly, Alexander Melnitzky also believes that the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter does include cyberespionage, because data thefts in cyberespionage entails detrimental effects on the peace and security of nations.⁴¹\n## B.

Counter-Terrorism Implementation Taskforce (CTITF) defines cyberterrorism as “terrorist attacks by remotely altering information on a computer system or disrupting the flow of data between computer systems.”44 An example of computer system controlling infrastructure is the Supervisory Control and Data system (SCADA), which monitors and controls traffic systems, railroad switches, gas and electricity distribution networks, and water purification plants.45 The unauthorized use of SCADA by hacking can be considered cyberterrorism.46\nGeneral international laws47—prohibiting states from intervening in other states, using force, and launching terrorist activities from their states—are, by using the principle of state responsibility, flexible enough to incorporate a prohibition on cyberterrorism.48 For instance, there have been discussions on a prohibition on using force and armed attack in other states, and on whether the use of force in self-defense encompasses cyberterrorism.49 Specifically, more serious cyberattacks by state militaries against other states without an armed conflict come under the prohibition on the use of force.50 Likewise, instruments of national and regional51 laws also incorporate prohibition on the offense undertaken by cyber means, such as fraud, extortion, terrorism, stalking attacks on information systems, and misuse of computers.52 The Association of South East Asian Nationals (ASEAN) Convention on Counter Terrorism (2007)\n43.

The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴\nSaul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general\n53.

Cyberoperations\nWhistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange have revealed to the world that cyberwarfare/cyberoperations are currently the biggest threat⁷⁶ to governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. Under these activities using cyberspace, governments and corporations⁷⁷ are proactively and preventively monitoring,⁷⁸ collecting, and investigating⁷⁹ data of all the aforementioned subjects. For instance, corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and AOL are collecting and monitoring the data⁸⁰ of its users for economic profit, for future business aspects, and to collaborate with intelligence services.⁸¹ Owing to the deep analytical artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of Google, fueled by the data of all its users regarding their political proclivities, likes and dislikes, daily routines, and query searches, it is said that Google knows an individual more than that individual knows themselves.⁸²\nWarlike cyberoperations and cyber activities are often referred to as cyberattacks, and their militarization under the patronage of intelligence agencies is characterized as cyberwarfare.⁸³ Cyberwarfare is defined by Michael Schmitt as the “employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving [military] objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”⁸⁴ The Netherlands has defined cyberwarfare as “the conduct of military operations to disrupt, mislead, modify or destroy an opponent’s computer systems or networks by means of cyber capabilities.”⁸⁵ The United Kingdom’s (UK’s) view is that “cyber warfare can enable actors to achieve their political and strategic goals without the need for armed conflict.”⁸⁶ Schmitt’s definition generally focuses on the use of cyberspace\n76.

It is divided into two sections: Section A will discuss the notions of “cyberspace” and “national jurisdiction” in relation to cyberattacks, and Section B will discuss the concept of “state responsibility” with regard to cyberattacks.\n## A. Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction\nCyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹\nFrom an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself.

If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that\n158.

Examples of such acts are surveillance and espionage by state organs or individuals from other states.¹⁸³ However, espionage is not prohibited under international law, and some further proof of damage to another state is required to establish a breach of an international obligation in cyberspace.¹⁸⁴ Nevertheless, where something is not mentioned in international law, that does not mean that something is entirely permissible; in fact, no state claims that espionage is a lawful act.¹⁸⁵ In some cases, the concept of attribution is inapplicable, where de facto organs/agents of states and concerns of failures to act are involved; here, the notion of due diligence is applicable.¹⁸⁶ Article 14 of ARS explicitly includes instances of failing to act, with reference to state responsibility, because the state is responsible for preventing all crimes emanating from its territories, if there is a persistent risk of it reoccurring.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, states cannot knowingly allow their territory to be used to violate international law, and they must take reasonable steps to prevent such activities.¹⁸⁸",

Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## B. Use of Force\nCyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the\n207.

The main critique of this interpretation is that the use of force in these attacks is not armed force²²⁶ (this approach is known as the instrumental approach, which is discussed in Section IV.B.5 below).²²⁷ This perspective argues that, instead of armed force, such use of force should be considered to be within the realms of “economic and political coercion.”²²⁸\n## 1. Economic and Political Coercions\nThe wording of the U.N. Charter prohibits the “use of force.”²²⁹ This use of force includes intention to coerce and use of weapons.²³⁰ The Eastern countries have repeatedly asked for economic and political coercions to be included within the meaning of the use of force.²³¹ For instance, the Brazilian government proposed including coercion by economic means in the realms of Article 2(4), though this was rejected.²³² The view of David Harris²³³ and the Belgian delegates²³⁴ is that the rejection of the Brazilian proposal does not prove that Article 2(4) does not include other forms of coercion. However, the prevailing and the Western²³⁵ view is that the wording of the “use of force” is limited to include “armed force,”²³⁶ given the fact that the wording of the U.N.\n223.

Charter.²⁴⁵ The inclusion of cyberattacks under economic and political coercions is flawed because the latter employs the economy as a weapon to pressure states by political and diplomatic means, and the former uses malware direct attacks as instruments to destroy targeted structures.²⁴⁶ Roscini questions why, when a kinetic bomb employed to destroy a financial institution is surely an armed attack, the same result by cyberattacks and the use of another weapon of choice should be considered any less.²⁴⁷\n237.

LAW\n[Vol. 28]\nThe UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allotting a naval blockade.²⁴⁸ The ICJ also established that arming and training armed groups is a use of force.²⁴⁹ And if we look at the intention of the drafters and history of developing the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force, it is clear that it has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances;²⁵⁰ it was drafted to stop aggression against other states.²⁵¹ Ian Brownlie concluded that the Kellogg-Briand Pact was intended to prohibit any use of substantial armed force.²⁵² In attempts to clarify the meaning of the use of force in the U.N. Charter, states have struggled to define it through UNGA resolutions but have failed to attain consensus.²⁵³ The Organization of American States Charter includes economic and political coercions separately from the use of armed force,²⁵⁴ to clarify that there is no relation between the use of force and other coercive measures. Richard Aldrich and Tom Farer conclude that the general prohibition on economic and political coercion under the OAS Charter are unenforceable,²⁵⁵ because it even outlaws all diplomatic measures by deeming them political coercion.²⁵⁶ Similar to the OAS Charter, the U.K. also believes that political and economic coercion should not be treated under the principle of prohibition on the use of force, but instead threats to political independence and sovereignty within such coercion should be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention in other states.²⁵⁷ For these reasons, all types of coercions should be seen as different from the use of force.²⁵⁸\n248.

Russia is of the view that cyberattacks are a use of force, similar to the use of weapons of mass destruction.²⁷² It noted that,\nfrom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not . . . Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.²⁷³\nBelarus also considers cyberattacks to be equivalent to weapons of mass destruction.²⁷⁴ Kazakhstan noted that ICT weapons can be used during\n259.

The international community is reluctant to treat cyberattacks as the use of force because, with the exception of one attack—the Farewell Dossier²⁸³—none of the attacks have caused human injury.²⁸⁴ It is pertinent to note here that the United States includes the employment of non-kinetic weapons and information operations within its vision,²⁸⁵ and the U.K.\n275.

Result-Based Approach\nScholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also\n---\n286.

Target-Based Approach\nThe target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³\n## 5. Instrument-Based Approach\nThis approach argues that only the use of traditional or conventional weapons can amount to the use of force, and cyberattacks can never be considered the use of force even in cases where it causes physical damage, because it merely uses computer coding in cyberspace instead of kinetic weapons.³¹⁴ Scholars believe that such an approach is “ill-suited” for\n306.

Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹\n## 6. Contextualist Approach\nThe contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or\n315.

Positivist Approach\nIn the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force.\n³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks\nDinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks\n333.

Armed Attack and Self-Defense\nArmed attacks are the uses of force by armed bands, with sufficient gravity of scale and effect beyond mere frontier skirmishes.³⁵² The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allocating a naval blockade.³⁵³ ICJ also established that “arming and training armed groups” is also a use\n344.

Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp's expansive interpretation of cyberattacks, instead the international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or as armed attacks.\nOn theoretical grounds, Dinniss shares the narrow interpretation, which allows the use of responsive force only in situations of grave forms of armed force. In this approach, most cyberattacks—even those that cause damage to property or human life as lesser forms of use of force—do not amount to armed attacks; therefore, there is no right to self-defense against them. For instance, the cyberattacks in Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet virus in 2010 did cause damage to intrinsic government properties and can be considered uses of force. But, since the gravity of the destruction they caused was moderate, they did not amount to an armed attack and did not give rise to the right to the responsive use of force in self-defense. However, there remains a question of attribution in cyberattacks, since most cyberattacks cannot be attributed to a state and are conducted by nonstate actors, and there is no right to self-defense against the use of force by nonstate actors until and unless their actions are attributable to a state. Similarly, for all cyberattacks, if attribution to a state is not conclusive, there is no right to self-defense against any cyberwarfare.\nIn conclusion, the defensive use of force against cyberattacks is only permissible in cases that amount to an equivalent damage of an armed attack, which entails a graver form of the use of force, with the severe effects and scale of destruction of property and human life.

    "Conclusion": "Though the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N.

INTRODUCTION Globally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks.\nIn this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## II. THREATS\nThis Part will explain the severity and nature of threats posed by cyberattacks by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. It is divided into three sections: Section A will discuss espionage using cyberattacks as a threat to nations; Section B will discuss terrorism through cyberattacks as a threat; and Section C will discuss other cyberoperations employed by aggressive states against victim states.\n### A. Espionage\nThe prevalence⁹ of cyberespionage is emerging as a threat to the peace and security of the world. Currently, the Internet or cyberspace is considered a “gift from God” for surveillance and espionage purposes,¹⁰ and this age has been called a “golden age for espionage.”¹¹ In cyberespionage, unauthorized states and nonstate actors infiltrate computer information systems to collect confidential information.¹² Cyberespionage can be defined as “[o]perations and related programs or activities conducted . . . in or through cyberspace, for the primary purpose of collecting intelligence . . . from, computers, information or communication systems, or networks, with the intent to remain\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] undetected.\"¹³ Cyberespionage is distinguished from the normal hacking of computers by its element of accessing and copying¹⁴ confidential data by exploiting cyberspace.¹⁵ It can violate international obligations and national laws.¹⁶ More specifically, it violates the basic principle of equal sovereignty among states¹⁷ and breaches the prohibition of using force and intervening in other states.¹⁸ Thus, it threatens the peace and security of the world.¹⁹ For instance, in 2010, Google alleged that Chinese hackers gained access to the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.²⁰ Similarly, in 2012, the Russian Kaspersky Lab (a security firm) detected the Flame virus emanating from the United States and Israel, which accessed, monitored, and collected the confidential data of Iranian oil companies.²¹ In another example of cyberespionage, China also hacked and copied terabytes of data regarding F-35 fighter jets from the server of the company Lockheed Martin.²² The United States protested that this activity was a threat to U.S. national and international peace and security.²³ Reports such as the Mandiant Report of 2013 show that there is a unit in the Chinese Liberation Army known as “Unit 61398,” which acts as an instrument of state and is tasked with undertaking massive espionage 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] citizens.”³³ China remonstrated that NSA activities were so severe that they should be rejected and condemned by the collective international community.³⁴ Since, according to the Nicaragua case, the principle of non-intervention is a part of customary international law,³⁵ the use of espionage violates sovereignty, political integrity,³⁶ and the principle of non-intervention in other states.³⁷ United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 66/24 (2011) establishes that “[s]overeignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to state conduct of ICT-related activities.”³⁸ The U.N. secretary-general substantiated this UNGA proposition by anchoring “ICT security in the existing framework of international law and understandings that govern state relations and provide the foundation for international peace and security.”³⁹ Russell Buchan argues that cyberespionage can cause massive damage to other states by disrupting governmental activities and banking systems; therefore, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter (prohibition on the use of force in other states) should be interpreted as including cyberespionage.⁴⁰ Similarly, Alexander Melnitzky also believes that the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter does include cyberespionage, because data thefts in cyberespionage entails detrimental effects on the peace and security of nations.⁴¹ ## B. Terrorism Cyberterrorism refers to attacks using electronic means such as computing devices to harm computer systems or physical infrastructure dependent on such computer systems.⁴² It is defined by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime as the “deliberate exploitation of computer 2019] CYBERWARFARE General international laws47—prohibiting states from intervening in other states, using force, and launching terrorist activities from their states—are, by using the principle of state responsibility, flexible enough to incorporate a prohibition on cyberterrorism.48 For instance, there have been discussions on a prohibition on using force and armed attack in other states, and on whether the use of force in self-defense encompasses cyberterrorism.49 Specifically, more serious cyberattacks by state militaries against other states without an armed conflict come under the prohibition on the use of force.50 Likewise, instruments of national and regional51 laws also incorporate prohibition on the offense undertaken by cyber means, such as fraud, extortion, terrorism, stalking attacks on information systems, and misuse of computers.52 The Association of South East Asian Nationals (ASEAN) Convention on Counter Terrorism (2007) TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] unequivocally incorporates cooperation among states against cyberterrorism.⁵³ In general, when we are discussing cyberterrorism, this is different from other organized crimes, because the inclusion of the term “terrorism” entails that the activities have an element of “political”⁵⁴ motive attached to them. The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴ Saul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] ## C. Cyberoperations Whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange have revealed to the world that cyberwarfare/cyberoperations are currently the biggest threat⁷⁶ to governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. Under these activities using cyberspace, governments and corporations⁷⁷ are proactively and preventively monitoring,⁷⁸ collecting, and investigating⁷⁹ data of all the aforementioned subjects. For instance, corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and AOL are collecting and monitoring the data⁸⁰ of its users for economic profit, for future business aspects, and to collaborate with intelligence services.⁸¹ Owing to the deep analytical artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of Google, fueled by the data of all its users regarding their political proclivities, likes and dislikes, daily routines, and query searches, it is said that Google knows an individual more than that individual knows themselves.⁸² Warlike cyberoperations and cyber activities are often referred to as cyberattacks, and their militarization under the patronage of intelligence agencies is characterized as cyberwarfare.⁸³ Cyberwarfare is defined by Michael Schmitt as the “employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving [military] objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”⁸⁴ The Netherlands has defined cyberwarfare as “the conduct of military operations to disrupt, mislead, modify or destroy an opponent’s computer systems or networks by means of cyber capabilities.”⁸⁵ The United Kingdom’s (UK’s) view is that “cyber warfare can enable actors to achieve their political and strategic goals without the need for armed conflict.”⁸⁶ Schmitt’s definition generally focuses on the use of cyberspace 2019] CYBERWARFARE In nature, cyberwarfare can be proactive, aggressive, preventive, or defensive⁹⁰ and can perform the strategic functions of deterrence, prevention, aggression, intervention, stabilization, and normalization.⁹¹ From a state-centric viewpoint, cyberoperations are undertaken to protect national security and achieve political/geopolitical interests.⁹² From the perspective of corporations, cyber activities by the likes of Facebook, Google, Kaspersky, and Symantec are undertaken purely for economic benefit.⁹³ By contrast, activist NGOs including Anonymous,⁹⁴ the TOR Project, WikiLeaks, and Bits of Freedom have ideological and political goals.⁹⁵ The increasing use of the “Internet of Things” since the events of 9/11 and the resultant rise of terrorist threats has led to increased cyber surveillance by states.⁹⁶ The dilemma is to choose between the public’s right to privacy and the security of the state’s political agendas,⁹⁷ which balances necessity, effectiveness, and human rights with regard to cyberoperations.⁹⁸ In this regard, Paul Ducheine has identified five major paradigms in the state’s cybersecurity framework: (1) Internet governance and diplomacy, (2) protection, (3) law enforcement, (4) intelligence and counterintelligence, and (5) military operations.⁹⁹ Under “Internet TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] governance¹⁰⁰ and diplomacy,¹⁰¹ cyberoperations are mainly proactive and preventive, shaping governance in cyberspace,¹⁰² keeping in mind the state’s security interests and strategies.¹⁰³ In the framework of “protection,” cyber activities by states are focused on protecting the integral infrastructure of state organs, such as guarding electricity, water, and military infrastructure,¹⁰⁴ and fighting malware viruses and other unauthorized intrusions in the systems.¹⁰⁵ For “law enforcement,” cyber activities are an amalgam of private and public operations at national and international levels¹⁰⁶ to investigate conduct, penalize crimes, take repressive measures, and enhance prosecution and policing.¹⁰⁷ In “intelligence and counterintelligence,” states undertake security operations, surveillance,¹⁰⁸ espionage,¹⁰⁹ and counterthreats.¹¹⁰ Intelligence agencies are allowed by their respective states to “exploit the information for other purposes, or directly intervene in order to prevent threats from reoccurring.”¹¹¹ The use of the Stuxnet virus is an example of proactive and aggressive operation by intelligence agencies for military purposes.¹¹² Finally, military operations under the cyberoperations of a state are undertaken to serve political interests, state strategies, and military objectives,¹¹³ by disrupting, destroying, or misleading an opponent’s networks and computer systems,¹¹⁴ for deterrence, 2019] CYBERWARFARE Examples of cyberwarfare include intelligence, counterintelligence, and military cyberoperations. For instance in domestic cyberoperations, Dutch intelligence agencies are legally entitled through a 2002 Act¹¹⁷ to intercept, search, and store data of telecommunications and hack computer systems.¹¹⁸ Aggressive international cyberoperations, such as the Stuxnet virus of 2010 and the Estonia attacks of 2007, made the world realize that the security of critical infrastructure is important,¹¹⁹ because international cyberoperations can disrupt societies.¹²⁰ In a joint collaborative cyberwarfare operation in 2010, the United States and Israel partnered to target Iranian nuclear facilities with the Stuxnet virus.¹²¹ Even though the Iranian system was not connected to the Internet, making cyber intrusion very difficult, Stuxnet was successful in sabotaging the Iranian “Industrial Control System.”¹²² Another example of aggressive intelligence and military operation is the cyberwarfare against Syria.¹²³ In 2007, cyberattacks by Israel used coding and tooling to trick the Syrian air defense system into not noticing invading Israeli fighter jets targeting Syrian nuclear facilities at al Kibar.¹²⁴ The governing principles of international law, including the notion of sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention (prohibition on the use of force), are violated by proactive/aggressive cyber military operations/cyberwarfare targeting other states.¹²⁵ Cyberoperations may also violate trade law, private TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] international law, and public international law,¹²⁶ in addition to the laws of using force.\n## III. KEY CONCEPTS This Part will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international law that are applicable to cyberattacks. It is divided into two sections: Section A will discuss the notions of “cyberspace” and “national jurisdiction” in relation to cyberattacks, and Section B will discuss the concept of “state responsibility” with regard to cyberattacks.\n## A. Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction Cyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹ From an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself. Sovereignty is a body of rights attributed to state territory in relation ¹²⁶. David P.

For example, in an English court, a U.S. publisher was convicted for publishing obscenity and violating the obscenity laws of the U.K.¹⁴⁹ In a German court, a Dutch seller was convicted of selling drugs online and violating German laws, even though the drug concerned was legal in the Netherlands, because the “origin rule” didn’t apply here owing to the protection of public health.¹⁵⁰ Similarly, an English defendant was held liable in a Dutch court for violating Dutch license laws that prohibited making a gambling site accessible in the Netherlands.¹⁵¹ An Australian court also found an American site guilty of defamation caused in Australia despite being in a U.S. publication,¹⁵² and the same approach was taken by an English court against Harrods Ltd.¹⁵³ Similarly, an English court held Google responsible for collecting the data of English residents without their consent;¹⁵⁴ later, Spain took a similar approach against Google for violating data protection laws.¹⁵⁵ For data protection, states like Iran and China have completely banned certain websites including Facebook and YouTube.¹⁵⁶ On the other hand, Johnson and Post propose that cyberspace should not be subject to sovereignty and must be self-regulating.¹⁵⁷ However, cyberspace cannot be considered sovereign itself, because it does not have any central authority to make and enforce laws, and it does not have its 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## B. State Responsibility\nState responsibility is a principle of international law¹⁶³ that includes acts or omissions attributable to a state and breaches of obligations under international law.¹⁶⁴ These breaches can be undertaken by groups, organizations, or individual beings on behalf of a state.¹⁶⁵ First, it should be seen whether the action or omission is undertaken by the organs of a state. If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] individual criminal responsibility should be applied.¹⁶⁹ However, the Articles on the Responsibility for States (ARS) do recognize exceptions for state responsibility for nonviolations of international law in cases involving distress,¹⁷⁰ self-defense,¹⁷¹ necessity,¹⁷² force majeure,¹⁷³ countermeasures¹⁷⁴ and consent.¹⁷⁵ The notion of sovereignty under state responsibility entails that it should control all the illicit cyber activities emanating from its infrastructure and computer activities.¹⁷⁶ However, in cyberspace, the attribution of state responsibility in violation of international law is difficult. For instance, Germany accused the U.K. and the United States of violating international law by using their embassies in Berlin for international cybersurveillance.¹⁷⁷ Similarly, a number of U.S. embassies in Asia and Europe collected the data of their host states.¹⁷⁸ In such cases, there is a possibility that accused states could deny liability because they used proxies to undertake such attacks.¹⁷⁹ Therefore, in cyberspace cases, victim states are allowed a more liberal procedure to infer evidential circumstances.¹⁸⁰ For example, the climate of political relationships may allow some insight in sudden cyberattacks, with a reverse burden of proof allowed.¹⁸¹ Since the attribution laws are a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks, there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy for other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.¹⁸² 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## IV. JUS AD BELLUM\nThis Part will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks. It will start by exploring the criteria by which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force,” while providing relevant definitions, *opinio juris*, and legal analyses on the subject. Then, it will analyze whether cyberattacks can be viewed as “armed attacks” and whether they can give rise to the right to self-defense. This Part is divided into three sections: Section A will provide a brief contextual analysis of the use of force and the international laws with regard to cyberwarfare; Section B will define the notion of the “use of force” in relation to cyberattacks, and\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] provide criteria for the circumstances in which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force.” Section B will also try to analyze whether cyberattacks can be considered “economic and political coercion.” It will attempt to provide the *opinio juris* of some key players in the international community on the consideration of cyberattacks as the “use of force.” Furthermore, it will examine different approaches to see the legality of cyberattacks under the laws of using force: the “result-based approach,” the “target-based approach,” the “instrument-based approach,” the “contextualist approach,” and the “positivist approach.” Section C will discuss the notions of “armed attack” and “self-defense” in relation to cyberattacks.\n## A. Contextual Analysis The Estonia attack of 2007 is an example of a cyberattack in which distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in Estonia.¹⁸⁹ Though there was no physical damage to infrastructure, tens of millions of euros in damage were caused by this cyberattack.¹⁹⁰ Initially, Estonia accused the Russian government of conducting these attacks,¹⁹¹ but it later retracted its stance to accuse the Kremlin of these damages¹⁹²—a Kremlin-based group of youths admitted responsibility—and acknowledged that the Russian government had no hand in the attacks.¹⁹³ Likewise, in 2010, the Stuxnet virus (a cyberattack), orchestrated by state-backed professionals, targeted Iran’s “industrial control system,”¹⁹⁴ targeting 2019] CYBERWARFARE Generally, states²⁰³ and international organizations²⁰⁴ are reluctant to view cyberattacks as armed attacks. So the question remains whether cyberattacks can be considered to be the use of force against other states, in the sense of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which explicitly prohibits all states from using force against other states.²⁰⁵ The prohibition on the use of force is a part of customary international law²⁰⁶ and is considered TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] jus cogens.²⁰⁷ There are only two exceptions to this principle: the use of force in self-defense²⁰⁸ and the use of force with the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## B. Use of Force Cyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] States,²²³ Mali,²²⁴ and Russia²²⁵ view cyberattacks disrupting the critical infrastructure of a country as the use of force against the sovereign victim state. The main critique of this interpretation is that the use of force in these attacks is not armed force²²⁶ (this approach is known as the instrumental approach, which is discussed in Section IV.B.5 below).²²⁷ This perspective argues that, instead of armed force, such use of force should be considered to be within the realms of “economic and political coercion.”²²⁸ ## 1. Economic and Political Coercions The wording of the U.N. Charter prohibits the “use of force.”²²⁹ This use of force includes intention to coerce and use of weapons.²³⁰ The Eastern countries have repeatedly asked for economic and political coercions to be included within the meaning of the use of force.²³¹ For instance, the Brazilian government proposed including coercion by economic means in the realms of Article 2(4), though this was rejected.²³² The view of David Harris²³³ and the Belgian delegates²³⁴ is that the rejection of the Brazilian proposal does not prove that Article 2(4) does not include other forms of coercion. However, the prevailing and the Western²³⁵ view is that the wording of the “use of force” is limited to include “armed force,”²³⁶ given the fact that the wording of the U.N.\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Bond believes that the term “use of force” is only relatable to the traditional/conventional use of weapons.²⁴² Roscini also concludes that the prohibition on the use of force does not include economic and political coercions, because they do not include weapons, which is implied under Article 41.²⁴³ Therefore, the United States argues that other forms of aggression, such as political and economic coercions, can be covered as a threat to international peace and security under Article 39²⁴⁴ of the U.N. Charter.²⁴⁵ The inclusion of cyberattacks under economic and political coercions is flawed because the latter employs the economy as a weapon to pressure states by political and diplomatic means, and the former uses malware direct attacks as instruments to destroy targeted structures.²⁴⁶ Roscini questions why, when a kinetic bomb employed to destroy a financial institution is surely an armed attack, the same result by cyberattacks and the use of another weapon of choice should be considered any less.²⁴⁷ TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allotting a naval blockade.²⁴⁸ The ICJ also established that arming and training armed groups is a use of force.²⁴⁹ And if we look at the intention of the drafters and history of developing the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force, it is clear that it has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances;²⁵⁰ it was drafted to stop aggression against other states.²⁵¹ Ian Brownlie concluded that the Kellogg-Briand Pact was intended to prohibit any use of substantial armed force.²⁵² In attempts to clarify the meaning of the use of force in the U.N. Charter, states have struggled to define it through UNGA resolutions but have failed to attain consensus.²⁵³ The Organization of American States Charter includes economic and political coercions separately from the use of armed force,²⁵⁴ to clarify that there is no relation between the use of force and other coercive measures. Richard Aldrich and Tom Farer conclude that the general prohibition on economic and political coercion under the OAS Charter are unenforceable,²⁵⁵ because it even outlaws all diplomatic measures by deeming them political coercion.²⁵⁶ Similar to the OAS Charter, the U.K. also believes that political and economic coercion should not be treated under the principle of prohibition on the use of force, but instead threats to political independence and sovereignty within such coercion should be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention in other states.²⁵⁷ For these reasons, all types of coercions should be seen as different from the use of force.²⁵⁸ 2019] CYBERWARFARE Since the prohibition on the use of force was adopted before the electronic age of information, it can be applied to cyberattacks.²⁵⁹ Countries including China,²⁶⁰ Hungary,²⁶¹ Australia,²⁶² Cuba,²⁶³ Italy,²⁶⁴ Iran,²⁶⁵ the Russian Federation, Mali,²⁶⁶ U.K.,²⁶⁷ Qatar,²⁶⁸ the Netherlands,²⁶⁹ and the United States,²⁷⁰ as well as the European Union,²⁷¹ believe that the prohibition on the use of force does include cyberattacks. Russia is of the view that cyberattacks are a use of force, similar to the use of weapons of mass destruction.²⁷² It noted that, from a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.²⁷³ Belarus also considers cyberattacks to be equivalent to weapons of mass destruction.²⁷⁴ Kazakhstan noted that ICT weapons can be used during TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] armed conflicts.²⁷⁵ Cuba stated that ICT weapons can cause destruction to critical national infrastructure (CNI) and can threaten the peace and security of the world.²⁷⁶ Spain made an analogy similar to the Cuban stance.²⁷⁷ Canada, the U.K., Australia, India, France, New Zealand, and Germany have been the victims of large- and small-scale cyberattacks, but none has treated cyberattacks as the use of force against their land.²⁷⁸ Instead, they have treated cyberwarfare to be the equivalent of cyberespionage.²⁷⁹ China has also been a victim of massive cyberattacks, which have compromised its military secrets and caused damage to the state;²⁸⁰ thus far, China has also not formally published any statement that treats cyberattacks as the use of force.²⁸¹ The U.S. policy against cyberattacks is to pursue defensive and preemptive counter-cyberattacks targeting the computer systems of perpetrators with military means,²⁸² but it is not clear whether the United States considers cyberattacks to be the use of force. The international community is reluctant to treat cyberattacks as the use of force because, with the exception of one attack—the Farewell Dossier²⁸³—none of the attacks have caused human injury.²⁸⁴ It is pertinent to note here that the United States includes the employment of non-kinetic weapons and information operations within its vision,²⁸⁵ and the U.K.\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Based on the *opinio juris* of U.N. members, the UNGA report of 2013 on the inclusion of cyberattacks within the realm of the prohibition on the use of force concluded that “international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [Information and Communications Technologies] environment.”²⁸⁷ For such application, however, cyberattacks need to meet three main criteria: (1) The cyberattack must be attributable to a state; (2) the cyberattack must be equivalent to the use or threat of force, which is armed force capable of causing the destruction of property or life; and (3) the cyberattack must be international in nature (taking place across borders), where one state is targeting another.²⁸⁸ In addition, any cyberattack that produces the same results that a conventional kinetic energy weapon does can be considered the use of armed force.²⁸⁹ ## 3. Result-Based Approach Scholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also --- TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] considers that the use of force must cause some sort of human injury.²⁹⁶ Under this presumption, the vast majority of cyberattacks, which do not cause any sort of destruction, can never be considered the use of force.²⁹⁷ Brownlie argues that, for instance, though biological and chemical weapons do not employ kinetic force, because they can cause the destruction of property and life, they can still easily be considered a weapon.²⁹⁸ This kind of analysis of consequences is known as the result-based perspective.²⁹⁹ Under this perspective, Cassandra LaRae-Perez argues that long-term economic sanctions can cause a lot of damage to both property and human life, in a similar way to other weapons using kinetic energy, and thus sanctions should also be considered the use of force under the aegis of Article 2(4).³⁰⁰ However, the economic embargos that caused massive destruction such as the embargos on Cuba and Arab states, by the United States and Israel, respectively, were never treated by the international community as the use of force.³⁰¹ Therefore, Schmitt maintains that quantifying direct destruction caused by economic coercion is a difficult task.³⁰² Nonetheless, Heather Dinniss counterargues that cyberattacks using non-kinetic force, causing destruction of property, should not, from a legal perspective, be differentiated from other forms of use of force, using a result-based approach.³⁰³ This result-based approach is the prevailing and the most acceptable approach, judging the characteristics of armed forces by analyzing the destruction it causes to property and human beings.³⁰⁴ Therefore, the cyberattacks should not be viewed as any less than other weapons used in armed conflicts.³⁰⁵ The HPCR Manual endorses cyberattacks, computer codes, malware, and their associated components as being considered means of warfare and accepts that destruction can be 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## 4. Target-Based Approach\nThe target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³\n## 5. Instrument-Based Approach\nThis approach argues that only the use of traditional or conventional weapons can amount to the use of force, and cyberattacks can never be considered the use of force even in cases where it causes physical damage, because it merely uses computer coding in cyberspace instead of kinetic weapons.³¹⁴ Scholars believe that such an approach is “ill-suited” for\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] analyzing cyberattacks,³¹⁵ and the weapon of choice can be anything ranging from ordinary household tools³¹⁶ to nonkinetic energy weapons.³¹⁷ For instance, the ICJ accepted that assistance to armed bands could amount to the use of force, because enabling people to use force is itself a use of force.³¹⁸ One should not focus on the weapon of choice or the mechanism employed, but rather see the consequences.³¹⁹ For example, an analogy of a murder case will suffice to prove that the instrument-based approach is ill-suited for analyzing the use of force under the U.N. Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹ ## 6. Contextualist Approach The contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## 7. Positivist Approach\nIn the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force.\n³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks\nDinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Therefore, Dinniss concludes that the tangibility of weapon of choice is irrelevant in considering whether cyberattacks can be considered the use of force.³⁴⁸ Instead, she believes that the severity of damage caused in terms of destruction to property and human lives by cyberattacks determines whether the attack is a use of force or not.³⁴⁹ For instance, if the physical results of a cyberattack are minimal, it cannot be considered a use of force, and if its results are grave, then it can be considered a use of force.³⁵⁰ But this does not establish that lesser consequences by cyberattacks are permissible by the principle of international law; less-serious cyberattacks may still violate the principle of non-intervention and the principle of sovereignty and can still be considered a threat to international peace and security.³⁵¹ ## C. Armed Attack and Self-Defense Armed attacks are the uses of force by armed bands, with sufficient gravity of scale and effect beyond mere frontier skirmishes.³⁵² The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allocating a naval blockade.³⁵³ ICJ also established that “arming and training armed groups” is also a use TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] of force.³⁵⁴ The use of force in self-defense is allowed against a more serious use of force amounting to an armed attack; a lesser form of armed attack is still an illegal use of force but does not create a right to use force in self-defense.³⁵⁵ This scale of using force from lesser forms to graver forms is mainly to maintain the peace of the world.³⁵⁶ However, there are two kinds of scholars: those who interpret the right to self-defense expansively and those who interpret it narrowly.³⁵⁷ Scholars also argue that victim states have the right to take responsive measures even in response to lesser forms of force in a proportional manner.³⁵⁸ For instance, in an expansive view, in the *Oil Platform* case, Judge Simma argued that victim states should not be forced to not defend themselves against the use of force against them, because the principle of proportionality is able to contain escalation of incidents.³⁵⁹ Russia also takes an expansive view when dealing with the right to self-defense in cyberattacks, because it doesn't differentiate between graver and lesser forms of armed attack.³⁶⁰ The United States takes a narrow view for dealing with the right to self-defense in cyberattacks.³⁶¹ It said that, if a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge the victim nation if it concluded that it was a victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.³⁶² Schmitt is of the narrow view; he says that, in cases of cyberattacks where the intentions of the perpetrators is to cause the destruction of property or human life (armed attacks that threaten the stability and peace of the world), the right to self-defense is permissible.³⁶³ On the other hand, Sharp, from an expansive view, believes that right to self-defense and the 2019] CYBERWARFARE On theoretical grounds, Dinniss shares the narrow interpretation, which allows the use of responsive force only in situations of grave forms of armed force.[367] In this approach, most cyberattacks—even those that cause damage to property or human life as lesser forms of use of force—do not amount to armed attacks; therefore, there is no right to self-defense against them.[368] For instance, the cyberattacks in Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet virus in 2010 did cause damage to intrinsic government properties and can be considered uses of force.[369] But, since the gravity of the destruction they caused was moderate, they did not amount to an armed attack and did not give rise to the right to the responsive use of force in self-defense.[370] However, there remains a question of attribution in cyberattacks, since most cyberattacks cannot be attributed to a state and are conducted by nonstate actors, and there is no right to self-defense against the use of force by nonstate actors until and unless their actions are attributable to a state.[371] Similarly, for all cyberattacks, if attribution to a state is not conclusive, there is no right to self-defense against any cyberwarfare.[372] In conclusion, the defensive use of force against cyberattacks is only permissible in cases that amount to an equivalent damage of an armed attack, which entails a graver form of the use of force, with the severe effects and scale of destruction of property and human life.[373] However, this Article concludes that, even in lesser forms of the use of force with TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] cyberattacks that can destroy property or human life, a victim state has the right to self-defense, and the right to employ similar and proportionate use of force, be it in the form of responsive cyberattacks or by claiming rightful sovereignty and political independence. Lesser forms of the use of force with cyberattacks do violate the principle of nonintervention and the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore, a victim state can either take proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council to take appropriate measures against the aggressor state.³⁷⁴ ## V. CONCLUSION Though the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹ ³⁷⁴. *Id.* ³⁷⁵.

INTRODUCTION Globally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks. In this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?",

Charter (prohibition on the use of force in other states) should be interpreted as including cyberespionage.⁴⁰ Similarly, Alexander Melnitzky also believes that the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the U.N.

Counter-Terrorism Implementation Taskforce (CTITF) defines cyberterrorism as “terrorist attacks by remotely altering information on a computer system or disrupting the flow of data between computer systems.”44 An example of computer system controlling infrastructure is the Supervisory Control and Data system (SCADA), which monitors and controls traffic systems, railroad switches, gas and electricity distribution networks, and water purification plants.45 The unauthorized use of SCADA by hacking can be considered cyberterrorism.46 General international laws47—prohibiting states from intervening in other states, using force, and launching terrorist activities from their states—are, by using the principle of state responsibility, flexible enough to incorporate a prohibition on cyberterrorism.48 For instance, there have been discussions on a prohibition on using force and armed attack in other states, and on whether the use of force in self-defense encompasses cyberterrorism.49 Specifically, more serious cyberattacks by state militaries against other states without an armed conflict come under the prohibition on the use of force.50 Likewise, instruments of national and regional51 laws also incorporate prohibition on the offense undertaken by cyber means, such as fraud, extortion, terrorism, stalking attacks on information systems, and misuse of computers.52 The Association of South East Asian Nationals (ASEAN) Convention on Counter Terrorism (2007)",

The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴ Saul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general",

KEY CONCEPTS This Part will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international law that are applicable to cyberattacks. It is divided into two sections: Section A will discuss the notions of “cyberspace” and “national jurisdiction” in relation to cyberattacks, and Section B will discuss the concept of “state responsibility” with regard to cyberattacks. ## A. Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction Cyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹ From an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself. Sovereignty is a body of rights attributed to state territory in relation ¹²⁶. David P.

For example, in an English court, a U.S. publisher was convicted for publishing obscenity and violating the obscenity laws of the U.K.¹⁴⁹ In a German court, a Dutch seller was convicted of selling drugs online and violating German laws, even though the drug concerned was legal in the Netherlands, because the “origin rule” didn’t apply here owing to the protection of public health.¹⁵⁰ Similarly, an English defendant was held liable in a Dutch court for violating Dutch license laws that prohibited making a gambling site accessible in the Netherlands.¹⁵¹ An Australian court also found an American site guilty of defamation caused in Australia despite being in a U.S. publication,¹⁵² and the same approach was taken by an English court against Harrods Ltd.¹⁵³ Similarly, an English court held Google responsible for collecting the data of English residents without their consent;¹⁵⁴ later, Spain took a similar approach against Google for violating data protection laws.¹⁵⁵ For data protection, states like Iran and China have completely banned certain websites including Facebook and YouTube.¹⁵⁶ On the other hand, Johnson and Post propose that cyberspace should not be subject to sovereignty and must be self-regulating.¹⁵⁷ However, cyberspace cannot be considered sovereign itself, because it does not have any central authority to make and enforce laws, and it does not have its",

State Responsibility State responsibility is a principle of international law¹⁶³ that includes acts or omissions attributable to a state and breaches of obligations under international law.¹⁶⁴ These breaches can be undertaken by groups, organizations, or individual beings on behalf of a state.¹⁶⁵ First, it should be seen whether the action or omission is undertaken by the organs of a state. If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that",

For instance, Germany accused the U.K. and the United States of violating international law by using their embassies in Berlin for international cybersurveillance.¹⁷⁷ Similarly, a number of U.S. embassies in Asia and Europe collected the data of their host states.¹⁷⁸ In such cases, there is a possibility that accused states could deny liability because they used proxies to undertake such attacks.¹⁷⁹ Therefore, in cyberspace cases, victim states are allowed a more liberal procedure to infer evidential circumstances.¹⁸⁰ For example, the climate of political relationships may allow some insight in sudden cyberattacks, with a reverse burden of proof allowed.¹⁸¹ Since the attribution laws are a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks, there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy for other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.¹⁸²",

Examples of such acts are surveillance and espionage by state organs or individuals from other states.¹⁸³ However, espionage is not prohibited under international law, and some further proof of damage to another state is required to establish a breach of an international obligation in cyberspace.¹⁸⁴ Nevertheless, where something is not mentioned in international law, that does not mean that something is entirely permissible; in fact, no state claims that espionage is a lawful act.¹⁸⁵ In some cases, the concept of attribution is inapplicable, where de facto organs/agents of states and concerns of failures to act are involved; here, the notion of due diligence is applicable.¹⁸⁶ Article 14 of ARS explicitly includes instances of failing to act, with reference to state responsibility, because the state is responsible for preventing all crimes emanating from its territories, if there is a persistent risk of it reoccurring.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, states cannot knowingly allow their territory to be used to violate international law, and they must take reasonable steps to prevent such activities.¹⁸⁸ ## IV. JUS AD BELLUM This Part will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks. It will start by exploring the criteria by which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force,” while providing relevant definitions, *opinio juris*, and legal analyses on the subject. Then, it will analyze whether cyberattacks can be viewed as “armed attacks” and whether they can give rise to the right to self-defense.

LAW [Vol. 28] jus cogens.²⁰⁷ There are only two exceptions to this principle: the use of force in self-defense²⁰⁸ and the use of force with the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. ## B. Use of Force Cyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the",

The main critique of this interpretation is that the use of force in these attacks is not armed force²²⁶ (this approach is known as the instrumental approach, which is discussed in Section IV.B.5 below).²²⁷ This perspective argues that, instead of armed force, such use of force should be considered to be within the realms of “economic and political coercion.”²²⁸ ## 1. Economic and Political Coercions The wording of the U.N. Charter prohibits the “use of force.”²²⁹ This use of force includes intention to coerce and use of weapons.²³⁰ The Eastern countries have repeatedly asked for economic and political coercions to be included within the meaning of the use of force.²³¹ For instance, the Brazilian government proposed including coercion by economic means in the realms of Article 2(4), though this was rejected.²³² The view of David Harris²³³ and the Belgian delegates²³⁴ is that the rejection of the Brazilian proposal does not prove that Article 2(4) does not include other forms of coercion.

Result-Based Approach Scholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also ---",

Target-Based Approach The target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³ ## 5.

Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹ ## 6. Contextualist Approach The contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or",

Positivist Approach In the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force. ³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks Dinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks",

Lesser forms of the use of force with cyberattacks do violate the principle of nonintervention and the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore, a victim state can either take proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council to take appropriate measures against the aggressor state.³⁷⁴ ## V. CONCLUSION Though the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹ ³⁷⁴. *Id.* ³⁷⁵. See Roscini, *supra* note 125, at 253. ³⁷⁶. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 588; see Dinstein, *supra* note 289, at 103. ³⁷⁷. See Roscini, *supra* note 125, at 253-54. ³⁷⁸. See SCHMITT, *supra* note 8, at 54. ³⁷⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 589. ³⁸⁰. See Bussolati, *supra* note 182, at 119-20. ³⁸¹. *Id.* at 126. 2019] CYBERWARFARE 39 Further, states’ intended cyberattacks³⁸² with lesser gravity, not destroying life or property and not disabling CNI/services, but coercing states into doing something that the victim country is free to do or not do,³⁸³ may still violate the principle of sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention in internal affairs of a country.³⁸⁴ Moreover, cyberattacks on information can be considered espionage, and they also violate the sovereignty of a state, but such attacks cannot be considered the use of force or an intervention in other countries, because such attacks have no destructive capabilities and they do not coerce states into doing something upon matters upon which they are free to decide.³⁸⁵ Information-targeting cyberattacks not amounting to the use of force can instead be considered espionage, as international crimes, and as threats to the peace, security, and stability of the international community. ---",

TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] # I. INTRODUCTION Globally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks. In this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?"

THREATS\nThis Part will explain the severity and nature of threats posed by cyberattacks by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. It is divided into three sections: Section A will discuss espionage using cyberattacks as a threat to nations; Section B will discuss terrorism through cyberattacks as a threat; and Section C will discuss other cyberoperations employed by aggressive states against victim states.\n### A. Espionage\nThe prevalence⁹ of cyberespionage is emerging as a threat to the peace and security of the world. Currently, the Internet or cyberspace is considered a “gift from God” for surveillance and espionage purposes,¹⁰ and this age has been called a “golden age for espionage.”¹¹ In cyberespionage, unauthorized states and nonstate actors infiltrate computer information systems to collect confidential information.¹² Cyberespionage can be defined as “[o]perations and related programs or activities conducted . . . in or through cyberspace, for the primary purpose of collecting intelligence . . . from, computers, information or communication systems, or networks, with the intent to remain\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] undetected.\"¹³ Cyberespionage is distinguished from the normal hacking of computers by its element of accessing and copying¹⁴ confidential data by exploiting cyberspace.¹⁵ It can violate international obligations and national laws.¹⁶ More specifically, it violates the basic principle of equal sovereignty among states¹⁷ and breaches the prohibition of using force and intervening in other states.¹⁸ Thus, it threatens the peace and security of the world.¹⁹ For instance, in 2010, Google alleged that Chinese hackers gained access to the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.²⁰ Similarly, in 2012, the Russian Kaspersky Lab (a security firm) detected the Flame virus emanating from the United States and Israel, which accessed, monitored, and collected the confidential data of Iranian oil companies.²¹ In another example of cyberespionage, China also hacked and copied terabytes of data regarding F-35 fighter jets from the server of the company Lockheed Martin.²² The United States protested that this activity was a threat to U.S. national and international peace and security.²³ Reports such as the Mandiant Report of 2013 show that there is a unit in the Chinese Liberation Army known as “Unit 61398,” which acts as an instrument of state and is tasked with undertaking massive espionage 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J.

OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] unequivocally incorporates cooperation among states against cyberterrorism.⁵³ In general, when we are discussing cyberterrorism, this is different from other organized crimes, because the inclusion of the term “terrorism” entails that the activities have an element of “political”⁵⁴ motive attached to them. The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴ Saul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J.

Under these activities using cyberspace, governments and corporations⁷⁷ are proactively and preventively monitoring,⁷⁸ collecting, and investigating⁷⁹ data of all the aforementioned subjects. For instance, corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and AOL are collecting and monitoring the data⁸⁰ of its users for economic profit, for future business aspects, and to collaborate with intelligence services.⁸¹ Owing to the deep analytical artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of Google, fueled by the data of all its users regarding their political proclivities, likes and dislikes, daily routines, and query searches, it is said that Google knows an individual more than that individual knows themselves.⁸² Warlike cyberoperations and cyber activities are often referred to as cyberattacks, and their militarization under the patronage of intelligence agencies is characterized as cyberwarfare.⁸³ Cyberwarfare is defined by Michael Schmitt as the “employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving [military] objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”⁸⁴ The Netherlands has defined cyberwarfare as “the conduct of military operations to disrupt, mislead, modify or destroy an opponent’s computer systems or networks by means of cyber capabilities.”⁸⁵ The United Kingdom’s (UK’s) view is that “cyber warfare can enable actors to achieve their political and strategic goals without the need for armed conflict.”⁸⁶ Schmitt’s definition generally focuses on the use of cyberspace 2019] CYBERWARFARE In nature, cyberwarfare can be proactive, aggressive, preventive, or defensive⁹⁰ and can perform the strategic functions of deterrence, prevention, aggression, intervention, stabilization, and normalization.⁹¹ From a state-centric viewpoint, cyberoperations are undertaken to protect national security and achieve political/geopolitical interests.⁹² From the perspective of corporations, cyber activities by the likes of Facebook, Google, Kaspersky, and Symantec are undertaken purely for economic benefit.⁹³ By contrast, activist NGOs including Anonymous,⁹⁴ the TOR Project, WikiLeaks, and Bits of Freedom have ideological and political goals.⁹⁵ The increasing use of the “Internet of Things” since the events of 9/11 and the resultant rise of terrorist threats has led to increased cyber surveillance by states.⁹⁶ The dilemma is to choose between the public’s right to privacy and the security of the state’s political agendas,⁹⁷ which balances necessity, effectiveness, and human rights with regard to cyberoperations.⁹⁸ In this regard, Paul Ducheine has identified five major paradigms in the state’s cybersecurity framework: (1) Internet governance and diplomacy, (2) protection, (3) law enforcement, (4) intelligence and counterintelligence, and (5) military operations.⁹⁹ Under “Internet TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] governance¹⁰⁰ and diplomacy,¹⁰¹ cyberoperations are mainly proactive and preventive, shaping governance in cyberspace,¹⁰² keeping in mind the state’s security interests and strategies.¹⁰³ In the framework of “protection,” cyber activities by states are focused on protecting the integral infrastructure of state organs, such as guarding electricity, water, and military infrastructure,¹⁰⁴ and fighting malware viruses and other unauthorized intrusions in the systems.¹⁰⁵ For “law enforcement,” cyber activities are an amalgam of private and public operations at national and international levels¹⁰⁶ to investigate conduct, penalize crimes, take repressive measures, and enhance prosecution and policing.¹⁰⁷ In “intelligence and counterintelligence,” states undertake security operations, surveillance,¹⁰⁸ espionage,¹⁰⁹ and counterthreats.¹¹⁰ Intelligence agencies are allowed by their respective states to “exploit the information for other purposes, or directly intervene in order to prevent threats from reoccurring.”¹¹¹ The use of the Stuxnet virus is an example of proactive and aggressive operation by intelligence agencies for military purposes.¹¹² Finally, military operations under the cyberoperations of a state are undertaken to serve political interests, state strategies, and military objectives,¹¹³ by disrupting, destroying, or misleading an opponent’s networks and computer systems,¹¹⁴ for deterrence, 2019] CYBERWARFARE Examples of cyberwarfare include intelligence, counterintelligence, and military cyberoperations. For instance in domestic cyberoperations, Dutch intelligence agencies are legally entitled through a 2002 Act¹¹⁷ to intercept, search, and store data of telecommunications and hack computer systems.¹¹⁸ Aggressive international cyberoperations, such as the Stuxnet virus of 2010 and the Estonia attacks of 2007, made the world realize that the security of critical infrastructure is important,¹¹⁹ because international cyberoperations can disrupt societies.¹²⁰ In a joint collaborative cyberwarfare operation in 2010, the United States and Israel partnered to target Iranian nuclear facilities with the Stuxnet virus.¹²¹ Even though the Iranian system was not connected to the Internet, making cyber intrusion very difficult, Stuxnet was successful in sabotaging the Iranian “Industrial Control System.”¹²² Another example of aggressive intelligence and military operation is the cyberwarfare against Syria.¹²³ In 2007, cyberattacks by Israel used coding and tooling to trick the Syrian air defense system into not noticing invading Israeli fighter jets targeting Syrian nuclear facilities at al Kibar.¹²⁴ The governing principles of international law, including the notion of sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention (prohibition on the use of force), are violated by proactive/aggressive cyber military operations/cyberwarfare targeting other states.¹²⁵ Cyberoperations may also violate trade law, private TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] international law, and public international law,¹²⁶ in addition to the laws of using force.\n## III. KEY CONCEPTS This Part will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international law that are applicable to cyberattacks. It is divided into two sections: Section A will discuss the notions of “cyberspace” and “national jurisdiction” in relation to cyberattacks, and Section B will discuss the concept of “state responsibility” with regard to cyberattacks.\n## A. Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction Cyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹ From an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself. Sovereignty is a body of rights attributed to state territory in relation ¹²⁶. David P.

For example, in an English court, a U.S. publisher was convicted for publishing obscenity and violating the obscenity laws of the U.K.¹⁴⁹ In a German court, a Dutch seller was convicted of selling drugs online and violating German laws, even though the drug concerned was legal in the Netherlands, because the “origin rule” didn’t apply here owing to the protection of public health.¹⁵⁰ Similarly, an English defendant was held liable in a Dutch court for violating Dutch license laws that prohibited making a gambling site accessible in the Netherlands.¹⁵¹ An Australian court also found an American site guilty of defamation caused in Australia despite being in a U.S. publication,¹⁵² and the same approach was taken by an English court against Harrods Ltd.¹⁵³ Similarly, an English court held Google responsible for collecting the data of English residents without their consent;¹⁵⁴ later, Spain took a similar approach against Google for violating data protection laws.¹⁵⁵ For data protection, states like Iran and China have completely banned certain websites including Facebook and YouTube.¹⁵⁶ On the other hand, Johnson and Post propose that cyberspace should not be subject to sovereignty and must be self-regulating.¹⁵⁷ However, cyberspace cannot be considered sovereign itself, because it does not have any central authority to make and enforce laws, and it does not have its 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## B. State Responsibility\nState responsibility is a principle of international law¹⁶³ that includes acts or omissions attributable to a state and breaches of obligations under international law.¹⁶⁴ These breaches can be undertaken by groups, organizations, or individual beings on behalf of a state.¹⁶⁵ First, it should be seen whether the action or omission is undertaken by the organs of a state. If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] individual criminal responsibility should be applied.¹⁶⁹ However, the Articles on the Responsibility for States (ARS) do recognize exceptions for state responsibility for nonviolations of international law in cases involving distress,¹⁷⁰ self-defense,¹⁷¹ necessity,¹⁷² force majeure,¹⁷³ countermeasures¹⁷⁴ and consent.¹⁷⁵ The notion of sovereignty under state responsibility entails that it should control all the illicit cyber activities emanating from its infrastructure and computer activities.¹⁷⁶ However, in cyberspace, the attribution of state responsibility in violation of international law is difficult. For instance, Germany accused the U.K. and the United States of violating international law by using their embassies in Berlin for international cybersurveillance.¹⁷⁷ Similarly, a number of U.S. embassies in Asia and Europe collected the data of their host states.¹⁷⁸ In such cases, there is a possibility that accused states could deny liability because they used proxies to undertake such attacks.¹⁷⁹ Therefore, in cyberspace cases, victim states are allowed a more liberal procedure to infer evidential circumstances.¹⁸⁰ For example, the climate of political relationships may allow some insight in sudden cyberattacks, with a reverse burden of proof allowed.¹⁸¹ Since the attribution laws are a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks, there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy for other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.¹⁸² 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## IV. JUS AD BELLUM\nThis Part will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks. It will start by exploring the criteria by which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force,” while providing relevant definitions, *opinio juris*, and legal analyses on the subject. Then, it will analyze whether cyberattacks can be viewed as “armed attacks” and whether they can give rise to the right to self-defense. This Part is divided into three sections: Section A will provide a brief contextual analysis of the use of force and the international laws with regard to cyberwarfare; Section B will define the notion of the “use of force” in relation to cyberattacks, and\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] provide criteria for the circumstances in which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force.” Section B will also try to analyze whether cyberattacks can be considered “economic and political coercion.” It will attempt to provide the *opinio juris* of some key players in the international community on the consideration of cyberattacks as the “use of force.” Furthermore, it will examine different approaches to see the legality of cyberattacks under the laws of using force: the “result-based approach,” the “target-based approach,” the “instrument-based approach,” the “contextualist approach,” and the “positivist approach.” Section C will discuss the notions of “armed attack” and “self-defense” in relation to cyberattacks.\n## A. Contextual Analysis The Estonia attack of 2007 is an example of a cyberattack in which distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in Estonia.¹⁸⁹ Though there was no physical damage to infrastructure, tens of millions of euros in damage were caused by this cyberattack.¹⁹⁰ Initially, Estonia accused the Russian government of conducting these attacks,¹⁹¹ but it later retracted its stance to accuse the Kremlin of these damages¹⁹²—a Kremlin-based group of youths admitted responsibility—and acknowledged that the Russian government had no hand in the attacks.¹⁹³ Likewise, in 2010, the Stuxnet virus (a cyberattack), orchestrated by state-backed professionals, targeted Iran’s “industrial control system,”¹⁹⁴ targeting 2019] CYBERWARFARE Generally, states²⁰³ and international organizations²⁰⁴ are reluctant to view cyberattacks as armed attacks. So the question remains whether cyberattacks can be considered to be the use of force against other states, in the sense of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which explicitly prohibits all states from using force against other states.²⁰⁵ The prohibition on the use of force is a part of customary international law²⁰⁶ and is considered TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] jus cogens.²⁰⁷ There are only two exceptions to this principle: the use of force in self-defense²⁰⁸ and the use of force with the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## B. Use of Force Cyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] States,²²³ Mali,²²⁴ and Russia²²⁵ view cyberattacks disrupting the critical infrastructure of a country as the use of force against the sovereign victim state. The main critique of this interpretation is that the use of force in these attacks is not armed force²²⁶ (this approach is known as the instrumental approach, which is discussed in Section IV.B.5 below).²²⁷ This perspective argues that, instead of armed force, such use of force should be considered to be within the realms of “economic and political coercion.”²²⁸ ## 1. Economic and Political Coercions The wording of the U.N. Charter prohibits the “use of force.”²²⁹ This use of force includes intention to coerce and use of weapons.²³⁰ The Eastern countries have repeatedly asked for economic and political coercions to be included within the meaning of the use of force.²³¹ For instance, the Brazilian government proposed including coercion by economic means in the realms of Article 2(4), though this was rejected.²³² The view of David Harris²³³ and the Belgian delegates²³⁴ is that the rejection of the Brazilian proposal does not prove that Article 2(4) does not include other forms of coercion. However, the prevailing and the Western²³⁵ view is that the wording of the “use of force” is limited to include “armed force,”²³⁶ given the fact that the wording of the U.N.\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Bond believes that the term “use of force” is only relatable to the traditional/conventional use of weapons.²⁴² Roscini also concludes that the prohibition on the use of force does not include economic and political coercions, because they do not include weapons, which is implied under Article 41.²⁴³ Therefore, the United States argues that other forms of aggression, such as political and economic coercions, can be covered as a threat to international peace and security under Article 39²⁴⁴ of the U.N. Charter.²⁴⁵ The inclusion of cyberattacks under economic and political coercions is flawed because the latter employs the economy as a weapon to pressure states by political and diplomatic means, and the former uses malware direct attacks as instruments to destroy targeted structures.²⁴⁶ Roscini questions why, when a kinetic bomb employed to destroy a financial institution is surely an armed attack, the same result by cyberattacks and the use of another weapon of choice should be considered any less.²⁴⁷ TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allotting a naval blockade.²⁴⁸ The ICJ also established that arming and training armed groups is a use of force.²⁴⁹ And if we look at the intention of the drafters and history of developing the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force, it is clear that it has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances;²⁵⁰ it was drafted to stop aggression against other states.²⁵¹ Ian Brownlie concluded that the Kellogg-Briand Pact was intended to prohibit any use of substantial armed force.²⁵² In attempts to clarify the meaning of the use of force in the U.N. Charter, states have struggled to define it through UNGA resolutions but have failed to attain consensus.²⁵³ The Organization of American States Charter includes economic and political coercions separately from the use of armed force,²⁵⁴ to clarify that there is no relation between the use of force and other coercive measures. Richard Aldrich and Tom Farer conclude that the general prohibition on economic and political coercion under the OAS Charter are unenforceable,²⁵⁵ because it even outlaws all diplomatic measures by deeming them political coercion.²⁵⁶ Similar to the OAS Charter, the U.K. also believes that political and economic coercion should not be treated under the principle of prohibition on the use of force, but instead threats to political independence and sovereignty within such coercion should be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention in other states.²⁵⁷ For these reasons, all types of coercions should be seen as different from the use of force.²⁵⁸ 2019] CYBERWARFARE Since the prohibition on the use of force was adopted before the electronic age of information, it can be applied to cyberattacks.²⁵⁹ Countries including China,²⁶⁰ Hungary,²⁶¹ Australia,²⁶² Cuba,²⁶³ Italy,²⁶⁴ Iran,²⁶⁵ the Russian Federation, Mali,²⁶⁶ U.K.,²⁶⁷ Qatar,²⁶⁸ the Netherlands,²⁶⁹ and the United States,²⁷⁰ as well as the European Union,²⁷¹ believe that the prohibition on the use of force does include cyberattacks. Russia is of the view that cyberattacks are a use of force, similar to the use of weapons of mass destruction.²⁷² It noted that, from a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.²⁷³ Belarus also considers cyberattacks to be equivalent to weapons of mass destruction.²⁷⁴ Kazakhstan noted that ICT weapons can be used during TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] armed conflicts.²⁷⁵ Cuba stated that ICT weapons can cause destruction to critical national infrastructure (CNI) and can threaten the peace and security of the world.²⁷⁶ Spain made an analogy similar to the Cuban stance.²⁷⁷ Canada, the U.K., Australia, India, France, New Zealand, and Germany have been the victims of large- and small-scale cyberattacks, but none has treated cyberattacks as the use of force against their land.²⁷⁸ Instead, they have treated cyberwarfare to be the equivalent of cyberespionage.²⁷⁹ China has also been a victim of massive cyberattacks, which have compromised its military secrets and caused damage to the state;²⁸⁰ thus far, China has also not formally published any statement that treats cyberattacks as the use of force.²⁸¹ The U.S. policy against cyberattacks is to pursue defensive and preemptive counter-cyberattacks targeting the computer systems of perpetrators with military means,²⁸² but it is not clear whether the United States considers cyberattacks to be the use of force. The international community is reluctant to treat cyberattacks as the use of force because, with the exception of one attack—the Farewell Dossier²⁸³—none of the attacks have caused human injury.²⁸⁴ It is pertinent to note here that the United States includes the employment of non-kinetic weapons and information operations within its vision,²⁸⁵ and the U.K.\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Based on the *opinio juris* of U.N. members, the UNGA report of 2013 on the inclusion of cyberattacks within the realm of the prohibition on the use of force concluded that “international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [Information and Communications Technologies] environment.”²⁸⁷ For such application, however, cyberattacks need to meet three main criteria: (1) The cyberattack must be attributable to a state; (2) the cyberattack must be equivalent to the use or threat of force, which is armed force capable of causing the destruction of property or life; and (3) the cyberattack must be international in nature (taking place across borders), where one state is targeting another.²⁸⁸ In addition, any cyberattack that produces the same results that a conventional kinetic energy weapon does can be considered the use of armed force.²⁸⁹ ## 3. Result-Based Approach Scholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also --- TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] considers that the use of force must cause some sort of human injury.²⁹⁶ Under this presumption, the vast majority of cyberattacks, which do not cause any sort of destruction, can never be considered the use of force.²⁹⁷ Brownlie argues that, for instance, though biological and chemical weapons do not employ kinetic force, because they can cause the destruction of property and life, they can still easily be considered a weapon.²⁹⁸ This kind of analysis of consequences is known as the result-based perspective.²⁹⁹ Under this perspective, Cassandra LaRae-Perez argues that long-term economic sanctions can cause a lot of damage to both property and human life, in a similar way to other weapons using kinetic energy, and thus sanctions should also be considered the use of force under the aegis of Article 2(4).³⁰⁰ However, the economic embargos that caused massive destruction such as the embargos on Cuba and Arab states, by the United States and Israel, respectively, were never treated by the international community as the use of force.³⁰¹ Therefore, Schmitt maintains that quantifying direct destruction caused by economic coercion is a difficult task.³⁰² Nonetheless, Heather Dinniss counterargues that cyberattacks using non-kinetic force, causing destruction of property, should not, from a legal perspective, be differentiated from other forms of use of force, using a result-based approach.³⁰³ This result-based approach is the prevailing and the most acceptable approach, judging the characteristics of armed forces by analyzing the destruction it causes to property and human beings.³⁰⁴ Therefore, the cyberattacks should not be viewed as any less than other weapons used in armed conflicts.³⁰⁵ The HPCR Manual endorses cyberattacks, computer codes, malware, and their associated components as being considered means of warfare and accepts that destruction can be 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## 4. Target-Based Approach\nThe target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³\n## 5. Instrument-Based Approach\nThis approach argues that only the use of traditional or conventional weapons can amount to the use of force, and cyberattacks can never be considered the use of force even in cases where it causes physical damage, because it merely uses computer coding in cyberspace instead of kinetic weapons.³¹⁴ Scholars believe that such an approach is “ill-suited” for\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] analyzing cyberattacks,³¹⁵ and the weapon of choice can be anything ranging from ordinary household tools³¹⁶ to nonkinetic energy weapons.³¹⁷ For instance, the ICJ accepted that assistance to armed bands could amount to the use of force, because enabling people to use force is itself a use of force.³¹⁸ One should not focus on the weapon of choice or the mechanism employed, but rather see the consequences.³¹⁹ For example, an analogy of a murder case will suffice to prove that the instrument-based approach is ill-suited for analyzing the use of force under the U.N. Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹ ## 6. Contextualist Approach The contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## 7. Positivist Approach\nIn the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force.\n³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks\nDinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Therefore, Dinniss concludes that the tangibility of weapon of choice is irrelevant in considering whether cyberattacks can be considered the use of force.³⁴⁸ Instead, she believes that the severity of damage caused in terms of destruction to property and human lives by cyberattacks determines whether the attack is a use of force or not.³⁴⁹ For instance, if the physical results of a cyberattack are minimal, it cannot be considered a use of force, and if its results are grave, then it can be considered a use of force.³⁵⁰ But this does not establish that lesser consequences by cyberattacks are permissible by the principle of international law; less-serious cyberattacks may still violate the principle of non-intervention and the principle of sovereignty and can still be considered a threat to international peace and security.³⁵¹ ## C. Armed Attack and Self-Defense Armed attacks are the uses of force by armed bands, with sufficient gravity of scale and effect beyond mere frontier skirmishes.³⁵² The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allocating a naval blockade.³⁵³ ICJ also established that “arming and training armed groups” is also a use TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] of force.³⁵⁴ The use of force in self-defense is allowed against a more serious use of force amounting to an armed attack; a lesser form of armed attack is still an illegal use of force but does not create a right to use force in self-defense.³⁵⁵ This scale of using force from lesser forms to graver forms is mainly to maintain the peace of the world.³⁵⁶ However, there are two kinds of scholars: those who interpret the right to self-defense expansively and those who interpret it narrowly.³⁵⁷ Scholars also argue that victim states have the right to take responsive measures even in response to lesser forms of force in a proportional manner.³⁵⁸ For instance, in an expansive view, in the *Oil Platform* case, Judge Simma argued that victim states should not be forced to not defend themselves against the use of force against them, because the principle of proportionality is able to contain escalation of incidents.³⁵⁹ Russia also takes an expansive view when dealing with the right to self-defense in cyberattacks, because it doesn't differentiate between graver and lesser forms of armed attack.³⁶⁰ The United States takes a narrow view for dealing with the right to self-defense in cyberattacks.³⁶¹ It said that, if a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge the victim nation if it concluded that it was a victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.³⁶² Schmitt is of the narrow view; he says that, in cases of cyberattacks where the intentions of the perpetrators is to cause the destruction of property or human life (armed attacks that threaten the stability and peace of the world), the right to self-defense is permissible.³⁶³ On the other hand, Sharp, from an expansive view, believes that right to self-defense and the 2019] CYBERWARFARE On theoretical grounds, Dinniss shares the narrow interpretation, which allows the use of responsive force only in situations of grave forms of armed force.[367] In this approach, most cyberattacks—even those that cause damage to property or human life as lesser forms of use of force—do not amount to armed attacks; therefore, there is no right to self-defense against them.[368] For instance, the cyberattacks in Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet virus in 2010 did cause damage to intrinsic government properties and can be considered uses of force.[369] But, since the gravity of the destruction they caused was moderate, they did not amount to an armed attack and did not give rise to the right to the responsive use of force in self-defense.[370] However, there remains a question of attribution in cyberattacks, since most cyberattacks cannot be attributed to a state and are conducted by nonstate actors, and there is no right to self-defense against the use of force by nonstate actors until and unless their actions are attributable to a state.[371] Similarly, for all cyberattacks, if attribution to a state is not conclusive, there is no right to self-defense against any cyberwarfare.[372] In conclusion, the defensive use of force against cyberattacks is only permissible in cases that amount to an equivalent damage of an armed attack, which entails a graver form of the use of force, with the severe effects and scale of destruction of property and human life.[373] However, this Article concludes that, even in lesser forms of the use of force with TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] cyberattacks that can destroy property or human life, a victim state has the right to self-defense, and the right to employ similar and proportionate use of force, be it in the form of responsive cyberattacks or by claiming rightful sovereignty and political independence. Lesser forms of the use of force with cyberattacks do violate the principle of nonintervention and the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore, a victim state can either take proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council to take appropriate measures against the aggressor state.³⁷⁴ ## V. CONCLUSION Though the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹ ³⁷⁴. *Id.* ³⁷⁵.

OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW\n[Vol. 28]\n# I. INTRODUCTION\nGlobally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks.\nIn this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?\n1.

(3) What are the applicable international laws that can regulate or prevent cyberattacks? For these purposes, this Article is divided into three main Parts. Part II will explain the severity and nature of the threats posed by cyberattacks, by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. Part III will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international laws applicable to cyberattacks. Part IV will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks.\n## II. THREATS\nThis Part will explain the severity and nature of threats posed by cyberattacks by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. It is divided into three sections: Section A will discuss espionage using cyberattacks as a threat to nations; Section B will discuss terrorism through cyberattacks as a threat; and Section C will discuss other cyberoperations employed by aggressive states against victim states.\n### A. Espionage\nThe prevalence⁹ of cyberespionage is emerging as a threat to the peace and security of the world. Currently, the Internet or cyberspace is considered a “gift from God” for surveillance and espionage purposes,¹⁰ and this age has been called a “golden age for espionage.”¹¹ In cyberespionage, unauthorized states and nonstate actors infiltrate computer information systems to collect confidential information.¹² Cyberespionage can be defined as “[o]perations and related programs or activities conducted . . . in or through cyberspace, for the primary purpose of collecting intelligence . . . from, computers, information or communication systems, or networks, with the intent to remain\n9.

General Assembly, and he cancelled his scheduled meetings with the United States.²⁶ He said that the NSA had violated international law,²⁷ the sovereignty of the Brazilian nation, and the fundamental human rights of its citizens.²⁸ In regard to NSA leaked documents, The Guardian established that Angela Merkel’s activities had been monitored for more than a decade.²⁹ Such activity can be seen as a breach of the German state’s sovereignty.³⁰ In response, Merkel telephoned President Obama to protest the breach of her trust and demanded explanations.³¹ She said that “spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany.”³² The Brazilian and Chinese governments took similar stances with regard to NSA activities and demanded apologies; they viewed the surveillance as violations of “their sovereignties” and the “human rights of their\n24.

Charter (prohibition on the use of force in other states) should be interpreted as including cyberespionage.⁴⁰ Similarly, Alexander Melnitzky also believes that the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter does include cyberespionage, because data thefts in cyberespionage entails detrimental effects on the peace and security of nations.⁴¹\n## B.

Counter-Terrorism Implementation Taskforce (CTITF) defines cyberterrorism as “terrorist attacks by remotely altering information on a computer system or disrupting the flow of data between computer systems.”44 An example of computer system controlling infrastructure is the Supervisory Control and Data system (SCADA), which monitors and controls traffic systems, railroad switches, gas and electricity distribution networks, and water purification plants.45 The unauthorized use of SCADA by hacking can be considered cyberterrorism.46\nGeneral international laws47—prohibiting states from intervening in other states, using force, and launching terrorist activities from their states—are, by using the principle of state responsibility, flexible enough to incorporate a prohibition on cyberterrorism.48 For instance, there have been discussions on a prohibition on using force and armed attack in other states, and on whether the use of force in self-defense encompasses cyberterrorism.49 Specifically, more serious cyberattacks by state militaries against other states without an armed conflict come under the prohibition on the use of force.50 Likewise, instruments of national and regional51 laws also incorporate prohibition on the offense undertaken by cyber means, such as fraud, extortion, terrorism, stalking attacks on information systems, and misuse of computers.52 The Association of South East Asian Nationals (ASEAN) Convention on Counter Terrorism (2007)\n43.

The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴\nSaul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general\n53.

Cyberoperations\nWhistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange have revealed to the world that cyberwarfare/cyberoperations are currently the biggest threat⁷⁶ to governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. Under these activities using cyberspace, governments and corporations⁷⁷ are proactively and preventively monitoring,⁷⁸ collecting, and investigating⁷⁹ data of all the aforementioned subjects. For instance, corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and AOL are collecting and monitoring the data⁸⁰ of its users for economic profit, for future business aspects, and to collaborate with intelligence services.⁸¹ Owing to the deep analytical artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of Google, fueled by the data of all its users regarding their political proclivities, likes and dislikes, daily routines, and query searches, it is said that Google knows an individual more than that individual knows themselves.⁸²\nWarlike cyberoperations and cyber activities are often referred to as cyberattacks, and their militarization under the patronage of intelligence agencies is characterized as cyberwarfare.⁸³ Cyberwarfare is defined by Michael Schmitt as the “employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving [military] objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”⁸⁴ The Netherlands has defined cyberwarfare as “the conduct of military operations to disrupt, mislead, modify or destroy an opponent’s computer systems or networks by means of cyber capabilities.”⁸⁵ The United Kingdom’s (UK’s) view is that “cyber warfare can enable actors to achieve their political and strategic goals without the need for armed conflict.”⁸⁶ Schmitt’s definition generally focuses on the use of cyberspace\n76.

For instance in domestic cyberoperations, Dutch intelligence agencies are legally entitled through a 2002 Act¹¹⁷ to intercept, search, and store data of telecommunications and hack computer systems.¹¹⁸ Aggressive international cyberoperations, such as the Stuxnet virus of 2010 and the Estonia attacks of 2007, made the world realize that the security of critical infrastructure is important,¹¹⁹ because international cyberoperations can disrupt societies.¹²⁰ In a joint collaborative cyberwarfare operation in 2010, the United States and Israel partnered to target Iranian nuclear facilities with the Stuxnet virus.¹²¹ Even though the Iranian system was not connected to the Internet, making cyber intrusion very difficult, Stuxnet was successful in sabotaging the Iranian “Industrial Control System.”¹²² Another example of aggressive intelligence and military operation is the cyberwarfare against Syria.¹²³ In 2007, cyberattacks by Israel used coding and tooling to trick the Syrian air defense system into not noticing invading Israeli fighter jets targeting Syrian nuclear facilities at al Kibar.¹²⁴ The governing principles of international law, including the notion of sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention (prohibition on the use of force), are violated by proactive/aggressive cyber military operations/cyberwarfare targeting other states.¹²⁵ Cyberoperations may also violate trade law, private\n115.

It is divided into two sections: Section A will discuss the notions of “cyberspace” and “national jurisdiction” in relation to cyberattacks, and Section B will discuss the concept of “state responsibility” with regard to cyberattacks.\n## A. Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction\nCyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹\nFrom an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself. Sovereignty is a body of rights attributed to state territory in relation\n¹²⁶. David P.

For example, in an English court, a U.S. publisher was convicted for publishing obscenity and violating the obscenity laws of the U.K.¹⁴⁹ In a German court, a Dutch seller was convicted of selling drugs online and violating German laws, even though the drug concerned was legal in the Netherlands, because the “origin rule” didn’t apply here owing to the protection of public health.¹⁵⁰ Similarly, an English defendant was held liable in a Dutch court for violating Dutch license laws that prohibited making a gambling site accessible in the Netherlands.¹⁵¹ An Australian court also found an American site guilty of defamation caused in Australia despite being in a U.S. publication,¹⁵² and the same approach was taken by an English court against Harrods Ltd.¹⁵³ Similarly, an English court held Google responsible for collecting the data of English residents without their consent;¹⁵⁴ later, Spain took a similar approach against Google for violating data protection laws.¹⁵⁵ For data protection, states like Iran and China have completely banned certain websites including Facebook and YouTube.¹⁵⁶\nOn the other hand, Johnson and Post propose that cyberspace should not be subject to sovereignty and must be self-regulating.¹⁵⁷ However, cyberspace cannot be considered sovereign itself, because it does not have any central authority to make and enforce laws, and it does not have its\n147.

State Responsibility\nState responsibility is a principle of international law¹⁶³ that includes acts or omissions attributable to a state and breaches of obligations under international law.¹⁶⁴ These breaches can be undertaken by groups, organizations, or individual beings on behalf of a state.¹⁶⁵ First, it should be seen whether the action or omission is undertaken by the organs of a state. If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that\n158.

For instance, Germany accused the U.K. and the United States of violating international law by using their embassies in Berlin for international cybersurveillance.¹⁷⁷ Similarly, a number of U.S. embassies in Asia and Europe collected the data of their host states.¹⁷⁸ In such cases, there is a possibility that accused states could deny liability because they used proxies to undertake such attacks.¹⁷⁹ Therefore, in cyberspace cases, victim states are allowed a more liberal procedure to infer evidential circumstances.¹⁸⁰ For example, the climate of political relationships may allow some insight in sudden cyberattacks, with a reverse burden of proof allowed.¹⁸¹ Since the attribution laws are a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks, there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy for other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.¹⁸²\n169.

Examples of such acts are surveillance and espionage by state organs or individuals from other states.¹⁸³ However, espionage is not prohibited under international law, and some further proof of damage to another state is required to establish a breach of an international obligation in cyberspace.¹⁸⁴ Nevertheless, where something is not mentioned in international law, that does not mean that something is entirely permissible; in fact, no state claims that espionage is a lawful act.¹⁸⁵ In some cases, the concept of attribution is inapplicable, where de facto organs/agents of states and concerns of failures to act are involved; here, the notion of due diligence is applicable.¹⁸⁶ Article 14 of ARS explicitly includes instances of failing to act, with reference to state responsibility, because the state is responsible for preventing all crimes emanating from its territories, if there is a persistent risk of it reoccurring.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, states cannot knowingly allow their territory to be used to violate international law, and they must take reasonable steps to prevent such activities.¹⁸⁸\n## IV.

Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## B. Use of Force\nCyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the\n207.

OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW\n[Vol. 28]\nStates,²²³ Mali,²²⁴ and Russia²²⁵ view cyberattacks disrupting the critical infrastructure of a country as the use of force against the sovereign victim state. The main critique of this interpretation is that the use of force in these attacks is not armed force²²⁶ (this approach is known as the instrumental approach, which is discussed in Section IV.B.5 below).²²⁷ This perspective argues that, instead of armed force, such use of force should be considered to be within the realms of “economic and political coercion.”²²⁸\n## 1. Economic and Political Coercions\nThe wording of the U.N. Charter prohibits the “use of force.”²²⁹ This use of force includes intention to coerce and use of weapons.²³⁰ The Eastern countries have repeatedly asked for economic and political coercions to be included within the meaning of the use of force.²³¹ For instance, the Brazilian government proposed including coercion by economic means in the realms of Article 2(4), though this was rejected.²³² The view of David Harris²³³ and the Belgian delegates²³⁴ is that the rejection of the Brazilian proposal does not prove that Article 2(4) does not include other forms of coercion. However, the prevailing and the Western²³⁵ view is that the wording of the “use of force” is limited to include “armed force,”²³⁶ given the fact that the wording of the U.N.\n223.

Charter.²⁴⁵ The inclusion of cyberattacks under economic and political coercions is flawed because the latter employs the economy as a weapon to pressure states by political and diplomatic means, and the former uses malware direct attacks as instruments to destroy targeted structures.²⁴⁶ Roscini questions why, when a kinetic bomb employed to destroy a financial institution is surely an armed attack, the same result by cyberattacks and the use of another weapon of choice should be considered any less.²⁴⁷\n237.

Charter, states have struggled to define it through UNGA resolutions but have failed to attain consensus.²⁵³ The Organization of American States Charter includes economic and political coercions separately from the use of armed force,²⁵⁴ to clarify that there is no relation between the use of force and other coercive measures. Richard Aldrich and Tom Farer conclude that the general prohibition on economic and political coercion under the OAS Charter are unenforceable,²⁵⁵ because it even outlaws all diplomatic measures by deeming them political coercion.²⁵⁶ Similar to the OAS Charter, the U.K. also believes that political and economic coercion should not be treated under the principle of prohibition on the use of force, but instead threats to political independence and sovereignty within such coercion should be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention in other states.²⁵⁷ For these reasons, all types of coercions should be seen as different from the use of force.²⁵⁸\n248.

Russia is of the view that cyberattacks are a use of force, similar to the use of weapons of mass destruction.²⁷² It noted that,\nfrom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not . . . Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.²⁷³\nBelarus also considers cyberattacks to be equivalent to weapons of mass destruction.²⁷⁴ Kazakhstan noted that ICT weapons can be used during\n259.

The international community is reluctant to treat cyberattacks as the use of force because, with the exception of one attack—the Farewell Dossier²⁸³—none of the attacks have caused human injury.²⁸⁴ It is pertinent to note here that the United States includes the employment of non-kinetic weapons and information operations within its vision,²⁸⁵ and the U.K.\n275.

Result-Based Approach\nScholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also\n---\n286.

Target-Based Approach\nThe target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³\n## 5. Instrument-Based Approach\nThis approach argues that only the use of traditional or conventional weapons can amount to the use of force, and cyberattacks can never be considered the use of force even in cases where it causes physical damage, because it merely uses computer coding in cyberspace instead of kinetic weapons.³¹⁴ Scholars believe that such an approach is “ill-suited” for\n306.

Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹\n## 6. Contextualist Approach\nThe contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or\n315.

Positivist Approach\nIn the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force.\n³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks\nDinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks\n333.

Armed Attack and Self-Defense\nArmed attacks are the uses of force by armed bands, with sufficient gravity of scale and effect beyond mere frontier skirmishes.³⁵² The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allocating a naval blockade.³⁵³ ICJ also established that “arming and training armed groups” is also a use\n344.

Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp's expansive interpretation of cyberattacks, instead the international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or as armed attacks.\nOn theoretical grounds, Dinniss shares the narrow interpretation, which allows the use of responsive force only in situations of grave forms of armed force. In this approach, most cyberattacks—even those that cause damage to property or human life as lesser forms of use of force—do not amount to armed attacks; therefore, there is no right to self-defense against them. For instance, the cyberattacks in Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet virus in 2010 did cause damage to intrinsic government properties and can be considered uses of force. But, since the gravity of the destruction they caused was moderate, they did not amount to an armed attack and did not give rise to the right to the responsive use of force in self-defense. However, there remains a question of attribution in cyberattacks, since most cyberattacks cannot be attributed to a state and are conducted by nonstate actors, and there is no right to self-defense against the use of force by nonstate actors until and unless their actions are attributable to a state. Similarly, for all cyberattacks, if attribution to a state is not conclusive, there is no right to self-defense against any cyberwarfare.\nIn conclusion, the defensive use of force against cyberattacks is only permissible in cases that amount to an equivalent damage of an armed attack, which entails a graver form of the use of force, with the severe effects and scale of destruction of property and human life. However, this Article concludes that, even in lesser forms of the use of force with\n364. SHARP, supra note 310, at 129.\n365. Id. at 133.\n366. See Dinniss, supra note 6, at 81.\n367. Id.\n368.

Lesser forms of the use of force with cyberattacks do violate the principle of nonintervention and the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore, a victim state can either take proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council to take appropriate measures against the aggressor state.³⁷⁴\n## V. CONCLUSION\nThough the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹\n³⁷⁴. *Id.*\n³⁷⁵.

INTRODUCTION Globally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks.\nIn this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## II. THREATS\nThis Part will explain the severity and nature of threats posed by cyberattacks by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. It is divided into three sections: Section A will discuss espionage using cyberattacks as a threat to nations; Section B will discuss terrorism through cyberattacks as a threat; and Section C will discuss other cyberoperations employed by aggressive states against victim states.\n### A. Espionage\nThe prevalence⁹ of cyberespionage is emerging as a threat to the peace and security of the world. Currently, the Internet or cyberspace is considered a “gift from God” for surveillance and espionage purposes,¹⁰ and this age has been called a “golden age for espionage.”¹¹ In cyberespionage, unauthorized states and nonstate actors infiltrate computer information systems to collect confidential information.¹² Cyberespionage can be defined as “[o]perations and related programs or activities conducted . . . in or through cyberspace, for the primary purpose of collecting intelligence . . . from, computers, information or communication systems, or networks, with the intent to remain\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] undetected.\"¹³ Cyberespionage is distinguished from the normal hacking of computers by its element of accessing and copying¹⁴ confidential data by exploiting cyberspace.¹⁵ It can violate international obligations and national laws.¹⁶ More specifically, it violates the basic principle of equal sovereignty among states¹⁷ and breaches the prohibition of using force and intervening in other states.¹⁸ Thus, it threatens the peace and security of the world.¹⁹ For instance, in 2010, Google alleged that Chinese hackers gained access to the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.²⁰ Similarly, in 2012, the Russian Kaspersky Lab (a security firm) detected the Flame virus emanating from the United States and Israel, which accessed, monitored, and collected the confidential data of Iranian oil companies.²¹ In another example of cyberespionage, China also hacked and copied terabytes of data regarding F-35 fighter jets from the server of the company Lockheed Martin.²² The United States protested that this activity was a threat to U.S. national and international peace and security.²³ Reports such as the Mandiant Report of 2013 show that there is a unit in the Chinese Liberation Army known as “Unit 61398,” which acts as an instrument of state and is tasked with undertaking massive espionage 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] citizens.”³³ China remonstrated that NSA activities were so severe that they should be rejected and condemned by the collective international community.³⁴ Since, according to the Nicaragua case, the principle of non-intervention is a part of customary international law,³⁵ the use of espionage violates sovereignty, political integrity,³⁶ and the principle of non-intervention in other states.³⁷ United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 66/24 (2011) establishes that “[s]overeignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to state conduct of ICT-related activities.”³⁸ The U.N. secretary-general substantiated this UNGA proposition by anchoring “ICT security in the existing framework of international law and understandings that govern state relations and provide the foundation for international peace and security.”³⁹ Russell Buchan argues that cyberespionage can cause massive damage to other states by disrupting governmental activities and banking systems; therefore, Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter (prohibition on the use of force in other states) should be interpreted as including cyberespionage.⁴⁰ Similarly, Alexander Melnitzky also believes that the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter does include cyberespionage, because data thefts in cyberespionage entails detrimental effects on the peace and security of nations.⁴¹ ## B. Terrorism Cyberterrorism refers to attacks using electronic means such as computing devices to harm computer systems or physical infrastructure dependent on such computer systems.⁴² It is defined by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime as the “deliberate exploitation of computer 2019] CYBERWARFARE General international laws47—prohibiting states from intervening in other states, using force, and launching terrorist activities from their states—are, by using the principle of state responsibility, flexible enough to incorporate a prohibition on cyberterrorism.48 For instance, there have been discussions on a prohibition on using force and armed attack in other states, and on whether the use of force in self-defense encompasses cyberterrorism.49 Specifically, more serious cyberattacks by state militaries against other states without an armed conflict come under the prohibition on the use of force.50 Likewise, instruments of national and regional51 laws also incorporate prohibition on the offense undertaken by cyber means, such as fraud, extortion, terrorism, stalking attacks on information systems, and misuse of computers.52 The Association of South East Asian Nationals (ASEAN) Convention on Counter Terrorism (2007) TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] unequivocally incorporates cooperation among states against cyberterrorism.⁵³ In general, when we are discussing cyberterrorism, this is different from other organized crimes, because the inclusion of the term “terrorism” entails that the activities have an element of “political”⁵⁴ motive attached to them. The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴ Saul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] ## C. Cyberoperations Whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange have revealed to the world that cyberwarfare/cyberoperations are currently the biggest threat⁷⁶ to governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. Under these activities using cyberspace, governments and corporations⁷⁷ are proactively and preventively monitoring,⁷⁸ collecting, and investigating⁷⁹ data of all the aforementioned subjects. For instance, corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and AOL are collecting and monitoring the data⁸⁰ of its users for economic profit, for future business aspects, and to collaborate with intelligence services.⁸¹ Owing to the deep analytical artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of Google, fueled by the data of all its users regarding their political proclivities, likes and dislikes, daily routines, and query searches, it is said that Google knows an individual more than that individual knows themselves.⁸² Warlike cyberoperations and cyber activities are often referred to as cyberattacks, and their militarization under the patronage of intelligence agencies is characterized as cyberwarfare.⁸³ Cyberwarfare is defined by Michael Schmitt as the “employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving [military] objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”⁸⁴ The Netherlands has defined cyberwarfare as “the conduct of military operations to disrupt, mislead, modify or destroy an opponent’s computer systems or networks by means of cyber capabilities.”⁸⁵ The United Kingdom’s (UK’s) view is that “cyber warfare can enable actors to achieve their political and strategic goals without the need for armed conflict.”⁸⁶ Schmitt’s definition generally focuses on the use of cyberspace 2019] CYBERWARFARE In nature, cyberwarfare can be proactive, aggressive, preventive, or defensive⁹⁰ and can perform the strategic functions of deterrence, prevention, aggression, intervention, stabilization, and normalization.⁹¹ From a state-centric viewpoint, cyberoperations are undertaken to protect national security and achieve political/geopolitical interests.⁹² From the perspective of corporations, cyber activities by the likes of Facebook, Google, Kaspersky, and Symantec are undertaken purely for economic benefit.⁹³ By contrast, activist NGOs including Anonymous,⁹⁴ the TOR Project, WikiLeaks, and Bits of Freedom have ideological and political goals.⁹⁵ The increasing use of the “Internet of Things” since the events of 9/11 and the resultant rise of terrorist threats has led to increased cyber surveillance by states.⁹⁶ The dilemma is to choose between the public’s right to privacy and the security of the state’s political agendas,⁹⁷ which balances necessity, effectiveness, and human rights with regard to cyberoperations.⁹⁸ In this regard, Paul Ducheine has identified five major paradigms in the state’s cybersecurity framework: (1) Internet governance and diplomacy, (2) protection, (3) law enforcement, (4) intelligence and counterintelligence, and (5) military operations.⁹⁹ Under “Internet TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] governance¹⁰⁰ and diplomacy,¹⁰¹ cyberoperations are mainly proactive and preventive, shaping governance in cyberspace,¹⁰² keeping in mind the state’s security interests and strategies.¹⁰³ In the framework of “protection,” cyber activities by states are focused on protecting the integral infrastructure of state organs, such as guarding electricity, water, and military infrastructure,¹⁰⁴ and fighting malware viruses and other unauthorized intrusions in the systems.¹⁰⁵ For “law enforcement,” cyber activities are an amalgam of private and public operations at national and international levels¹⁰⁶ to investigate conduct, penalize crimes, take repressive measures, and enhance prosecution and policing.¹⁰⁷ In “intelligence and counterintelligence,” states undertake security operations, surveillance,¹⁰⁸ espionage,¹⁰⁹ and counterthreats.¹¹⁰ Intelligence agencies are allowed by their respective states to “exploit the information for other purposes, or directly intervene in order to prevent threats from reoccurring.”¹¹¹ The use of the Stuxnet virus is an example of proactive and aggressive operation by intelligence agencies for military purposes.¹¹² Finally, military operations under the cyberoperations of a state are undertaken to serve political interests, state strategies, and military objectives,¹¹³ by disrupting, destroying, or misleading an opponent’s networks and computer systems,¹¹⁴ for deterrence, 2019] CYBERWARFARE Examples of cyberwarfare include intelligence, counterintelligence, and military cyberoperations. For instance in domestic cyberoperations, Dutch intelligence agencies are legally entitled through a 2002 Act¹¹⁷ to intercept, search, and store data of telecommunications and hack computer systems.¹¹⁸ Aggressive international cyberoperations, such as the Stuxnet virus of 2010 and the Estonia attacks of 2007, made the world realize that the security of critical infrastructure is important,¹¹⁹ because international cyberoperations can disrupt societies.¹²⁰ In a joint collaborative cyberwarfare operation in 2010, the United States and Israel partnered to target Iranian nuclear facilities with the Stuxnet virus.¹²¹ Even though the Iranian system was not connected to the Internet, making cyber intrusion very difficult, Stuxnet was successful in sabotaging the Iranian “Industrial Control System.”¹²² Another example of aggressive intelligence and military operation is the cyberwarfare against Syria.¹²³ In 2007, cyberattacks by Israel used coding and tooling to trick the Syrian air defense system into not noticing invading Israeli fighter jets targeting Syrian nuclear facilities at al Kibar.¹²⁴ The governing principles of international law, including the notion of sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention (prohibition on the use of force), are violated by proactive/aggressive cyber military operations/cyberwarfare targeting other states.¹²⁵ Cyberoperations may also violate trade law, private TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] international law, and public international law,¹²⁶ in addition to the laws of using force.\n## III. KEY CONCEPTS This Part will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international law that are applicable to cyberattacks. It is divided into two sections: Section A will discuss the notions of “cyberspace” and “national jurisdiction” in relation to cyberattacks, and Section B will discuss the concept of “state responsibility” with regard to cyberattacks.\n## A. Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction Cyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹ From an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself. Sovereignty is a body of rights attributed to state territory in relation ¹²⁶. David P.

For example, in an English court, a U.S. publisher was convicted for publishing obscenity and violating the obscenity laws of the U.K.¹⁴⁹ In a German court, a Dutch seller was convicted of selling drugs online and violating German laws, even though the drug concerned was legal in the Netherlands, because the “origin rule” didn’t apply here owing to the protection of public health.¹⁵⁰ Similarly, an English defendant was held liable in a Dutch court for violating Dutch license laws that prohibited making a gambling site accessible in the Netherlands.¹⁵¹ An Australian court also found an American site guilty of defamation caused in Australia despite being in a U.S. publication,¹⁵² and the same approach was taken by an English court against Harrods Ltd.¹⁵³ Similarly, an English court held Google responsible for collecting the data of English residents without their consent;¹⁵⁴ later, Spain took a similar approach against Google for violating data protection laws.¹⁵⁵ For data protection, states like Iran and China have completely banned certain websites including Facebook and YouTube.¹⁵⁶ On the other hand, Johnson and Post propose that cyberspace should not be subject to sovereignty and must be self-regulating.¹⁵⁷ However, cyberspace cannot be considered sovereign itself, because it does not have any central authority to make and enforce laws, and it does not have its 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## B. State Responsibility\nState responsibility is a principle of international law¹⁶³ that includes acts or omissions attributable to a state and breaches of obligations under international law.¹⁶⁴ These breaches can be undertaken by groups, organizations, or individual beings on behalf of a state.¹⁶⁵ First, it should be seen whether the action or omission is undertaken by the organs of a state. If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] individual criminal responsibility should be applied.¹⁶⁹ However, the Articles on the Responsibility for States (ARS) do recognize exceptions for state responsibility for nonviolations of international law in cases involving distress,¹⁷⁰ self-defense,¹⁷¹ necessity,¹⁷² force majeure,¹⁷³ countermeasures¹⁷⁴ and consent.¹⁷⁵ The notion of sovereignty under state responsibility entails that it should control all the illicit cyber activities emanating from its infrastructure and computer activities.¹⁷⁶ However, in cyberspace, the attribution of state responsibility in violation of international law is difficult. For instance, Germany accused the U.K. and the United States of violating international law by using their embassies in Berlin for international cybersurveillance.¹⁷⁷ Similarly, a number of U.S. embassies in Asia and Europe collected the data of their host states.¹⁷⁸ In such cases, there is a possibility that accused states could deny liability because they used proxies to undertake such attacks.¹⁷⁹ Therefore, in cyberspace cases, victim states are allowed a more liberal procedure to infer evidential circumstances.¹⁸⁰ For example, the climate of political relationships may allow some insight in sudden cyberattacks, with a reverse burden of proof allowed.¹⁸¹ Since the attribution laws are a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks, there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy for other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.¹⁸² 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## IV. JUS AD BELLUM\nThis Part will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks. It will start by exploring the criteria by which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force,” while providing relevant definitions, *opinio juris*, and legal analyses on the subject. Then, it will analyze whether cyberattacks can be viewed as “armed attacks” and whether they can give rise to the right to self-defense. This Part is divided into three sections: Section A will provide a brief contextual analysis of the use of force and the international laws with regard to cyberwarfare; Section B will define the notion of the “use of force” in relation to cyberattacks, and\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] provide criteria for the circumstances in which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force.” Section B will also try to analyze whether cyberattacks can be considered “economic and political coercion.” It will attempt to provide the *opinio juris* of some key players in the international community on the consideration of cyberattacks as the “use of force.” Furthermore, it will examine different approaches to see the legality of cyberattacks under the laws of using force: the “result-based approach,” the “target-based approach,” the “instrument-based approach,” the “contextualist approach,” and the “positivist approach.” Section C will discuss the notions of “armed attack” and “self-defense” in relation to cyberattacks.\n## A. Contextual Analysis The Estonia attack of 2007 is an example of a cyberattack in which distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in Estonia.¹⁸⁹ Though there was no physical damage to infrastructure, tens of millions of euros in damage were caused by this cyberattack.¹⁹⁰ Initially, Estonia accused the Russian government of conducting these attacks,¹⁹¹ but it later retracted its stance to accuse the Kremlin of these damages¹⁹²—a Kremlin-based group of youths admitted responsibility—and acknowledged that the Russian government had no hand in the attacks.¹⁹³ Likewise, in 2010, the Stuxnet virus (a cyberattack), orchestrated by state-backed professionals, targeted Iran’s “industrial control system,”¹⁹⁴ targeting 2019] CYBERWARFARE Generally, states²⁰³ and international organizations²⁰⁴ are reluctant to view cyberattacks as armed attacks. So the question remains whether cyberattacks can be considered to be the use of force against other states, in the sense of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which explicitly prohibits all states from using force against other states.²⁰⁵ The prohibition on the use of force is a part of customary international law²⁰⁶ and is considered TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] jus cogens.²⁰⁷ There are only two exceptions to this principle: the use of force in self-defense²⁰⁸ and the use of force with the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## B. Use of Force Cyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the 2019] CYBERWARFARE TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] States,²²³ Mali,²²⁴ and Russia²²⁵ view cyberattacks disrupting the critical infrastructure of a country as the use of force against the sovereign victim state. The main critique of this interpretation is that the use of force in these attacks is not armed force²²⁶ (this approach is known as the instrumental approach, which is discussed in Section IV.B.5 below).²²⁷ This perspective argues that, instead of armed force, such use of force should be considered to be within the realms of “economic and political coercion.”²²⁸ ## 1. Economic and Political Coercions The wording of the U.N. Charter prohibits the “use of force.”²²⁹ This use of force includes intention to coerce and use of weapons.²³⁰ The Eastern countries have repeatedly asked for economic and political coercions to be included within the meaning of the use of force.²³¹ For instance, the Brazilian government proposed including coercion by economic means in the realms of Article 2(4), though this was rejected.²³² The view of David Harris²³³ and the Belgian delegates²³⁴ is that the rejection of the Brazilian proposal does not prove that Article 2(4) does not include other forms of coercion. However, the prevailing and the Western²³⁵ view is that the wording of the “use of force” is limited to include “armed force,”²³⁶ given the fact that the wording of the U.N.\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Bond believes that the term “use of force” is only relatable to the traditional/conventional use of weapons.²⁴² Roscini also concludes that the prohibition on the use of force does not include economic and political coercions, because they do not include weapons, which is implied under Article 41.²⁴³ Therefore, the United States argues that other forms of aggression, such as political and economic coercions, can be covered as a threat to international peace and security under Article 39²⁴⁴ of the U.N. Charter.²⁴⁵ The inclusion of cyberattacks under economic and political coercions is flawed because the latter employs the economy as a weapon to pressure states by political and diplomatic means, and the former uses malware direct attacks as instruments to destroy targeted structures.²⁴⁶ Roscini questions why, when a kinetic bomb employed to destroy a financial institution is surely an armed attack, the same result by cyberattacks and the use of another weapon of choice should be considered any less.²⁴⁷ TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allotting a naval blockade.²⁴⁸ The ICJ also established that arming and training armed groups is a use of force.²⁴⁹ And if we look at the intention of the drafters and history of developing the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force, it is clear that it has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances;²⁵⁰ it was drafted to stop aggression against other states.²⁵¹ Ian Brownlie concluded that the Kellogg-Briand Pact was intended to prohibit any use of substantial armed force.²⁵² In attempts to clarify the meaning of the use of force in the U.N. Charter, states have struggled to define it through UNGA resolutions but have failed to attain consensus.²⁵³ The Organization of American States Charter includes economic and political coercions separately from the use of armed force,²⁵⁴ to clarify that there is no relation between the use of force and other coercive measures. Richard Aldrich and Tom Farer conclude that the general prohibition on economic and political coercion under the OAS Charter are unenforceable,²⁵⁵ because it even outlaws all diplomatic measures by deeming them political coercion.²⁵⁶ Similar to the OAS Charter, the U.K. also believes that political and economic coercion should not be treated under the principle of prohibition on the use of force, but instead threats to political independence and sovereignty within such coercion should be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention in other states.²⁵⁷ For these reasons, all types of coercions should be seen as different from the use of force.²⁵⁸ 2019] CYBERWARFARE Since the prohibition on the use of force was adopted before the electronic age of information, it can be applied to cyberattacks.²⁵⁹ Countries including China,²⁶⁰ Hungary,²⁶¹ Australia,²⁶² Cuba,²⁶³ Italy,²⁶⁴ Iran,²⁶⁵ the Russian Federation, Mali,²⁶⁶ U.K.,²⁶⁷ Qatar,²⁶⁸ the Netherlands,²⁶⁹ and the United States,²⁷⁰ as well as the European Union,²⁷¹ believe that the prohibition on the use of force does include cyberattacks. Russia is of the view that cyberattacks are a use of force, similar to the use of weapons of mass destruction.²⁷² It noted that, from a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.²⁷³ Belarus also considers cyberattacks to be equivalent to weapons of mass destruction.²⁷⁴ Kazakhstan noted that ICT weapons can be used during TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] armed conflicts.²⁷⁵ Cuba stated that ICT weapons can cause destruction to critical national infrastructure (CNI) and can threaten the peace and security of the world.²⁷⁶ Spain made an analogy similar to the Cuban stance.²⁷⁷ Canada, the U.K., Australia, India, France, New Zealand, and Germany have been the victims of large- and small-scale cyberattacks, but none has treated cyberattacks as the use of force against their land.²⁷⁸ Instead, they have treated cyberwarfare to be the equivalent of cyberespionage.²⁷⁹ China has also been a victim of massive cyberattacks, which have compromised its military secrets and caused damage to the state;²⁸⁰ thus far, China has also not formally published any statement that treats cyberattacks as the use of force.²⁸¹ The U.S. policy against cyberattacks is to pursue defensive and preemptive counter-cyberattacks targeting the computer systems of perpetrators with military means,²⁸² but it is not clear whether the United States considers cyberattacks to be the use of force. The international community is reluctant to treat cyberattacks as the use of force because, with the exception of one attack—the Farewell Dossier²⁸³—none of the attacks have caused human injury.²⁸⁴ It is pertinent to note here that the United States includes the employment of non-kinetic weapons and information operations within its vision,²⁸⁵ and the U.K.\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Based on the *opinio juris* of U.N. members, the UNGA report of 2013 on the inclusion of cyberattacks within the realm of the prohibition on the use of force concluded that “international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [Information and Communications Technologies] environment.”²⁸⁷ For such application, however, cyberattacks need to meet three main criteria: (1) The cyberattack must be attributable to a state; (2) the cyberattack must be equivalent to the use or threat of force, which is armed force capable of causing the destruction of property or life; and (3) the cyberattack must be international in nature (taking place across borders), where one state is targeting another.²⁸⁸ In addition, any cyberattack that produces the same results that a conventional kinetic energy weapon does can be considered the use of armed force.²⁸⁹ ## 3. Result-Based Approach Scholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also --- TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] considers that the use of force must cause some sort of human injury.²⁹⁶ Under this presumption, the vast majority of cyberattacks, which do not cause any sort of destruction, can never be considered the use of force.²⁹⁷ Brownlie argues that, for instance, though biological and chemical weapons do not employ kinetic force, because they can cause the destruction of property and life, they can still easily be considered a weapon.²⁹⁸ This kind of analysis of consequences is known as the result-based perspective.²⁹⁹ Under this perspective, Cassandra LaRae-Perez argues that long-term economic sanctions can cause a lot of damage to both property and human life, in a similar way to other weapons using kinetic energy, and thus sanctions should also be considered the use of force under the aegis of Article 2(4).³⁰⁰ However, the economic embargos that caused massive destruction such as the embargos on Cuba and Arab states, by the United States and Israel, respectively, were never treated by the international community as the use of force.³⁰¹ Therefore, Schmitt maintains that quantifying direct destruction caused by economic coercion is a difficult task.³⁰² Nonetheless, Heather Dinniss counterargues that cyberattacks using non-kinetic force, causing destruction of property, should not, from a legal perspective, be differentiated from other forms of use of force, using a result-based approach.³⁰³ This result-based approach is the prevailing and the most acceptable approach, judging the characteristics of armed forces by analyzing the destruction it causes to property and human beings.³⁰⁴ Therefore, the cyberattacks should not be viewed as any less than other weapons used in armed conflicts.³⁰⁵ The HPCR Manual endorses cyberattacks, computer codes, malware, and their associated components as being considered means of warfare and accepts that destruction can be 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## 4. Target-Based Approach\nThe target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³\n## 5. Instrument-Based Approach\nThis approach argues that only the use of traditional or conventional weapons can amount to the use of force, and cyberattacks can never be considered the use of force even in cases where it causes physical damage, because it merely uses computer coding in cyberspace instead of kinetic weapons.³¹⁴ Scholars believe that such an approach is “ill-suited” for\n\nTULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] analyzing cyberattacks,³¹⁵ and the weapon of choice can be anything ranging from ordinary household tools³¹⁶ to nonkinetic energy weapons.³¹⁷ For instance, the ICJ accepted that assistance to armed bands could amount to the use of force, because enabling people to use force is itself a use of force.³¹⁸ One should not focus on the weapon of choice or the mechanism employed, but rather see the consequences.³¹⁹ For example, an analogy of a murder case will suffice to prove that the instrument-based approach is ill-suited for analyzing the use of force under the U.N. Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹ ## 6. Contextualist Approach The contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or 2019] CYBERWARFARE\n\n## 7. Positivist Approach\nIn the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force.\n³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks\nDinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks\n\n2019] CYBERWARFARE Therefore, Dinniss concludes that the tangibility of weapon of choice is irrelevant in considering whether cyberattacks can be considered the use of force.³⁴⁸ Instead, she believes that the severity of damage caused in terms of destruction to property and human lives by cyberattacks determines whether the attack is a use of force or not.³⁴⁹ For instance, if the physical results of a cyberattack are minimal, it cannot be considered a use of force, and if its results are grave, then it can be considered a use of force.³⁵⁰ But this does not establish that lesser consequences by cyberattacks are permissible by the principle of international law; less-serious cyberattacks may still violate the principle of non-intervention and the principle of sovereignty and can still be considered a threat to international peace and security.³⁵¹ ## C. Armed Attack and Self-Defense Armed attacks are the uses of force by armed bands, with sufficient gravity of scale and effect beyond mere frontier skirmishes.³⁵² The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allocating a naval blockade.³⁵³ ICJ also established that “arming and training armed groups” is also a use TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] of force.³⁵⁴ The use of force in self-defense is allowed against a more serious use of force amounting to an armed attack; a lesser form of armed attack is still an illegal use of force but does not create a right to use force in self-defense.³⁵⁵ This scale of using force from lesser forms to graver forms is mainly to maintain the peace of the world.³⁵⁶ However, there are two kinds of scholars: those who interpret the right to self-defense expansively and those who interpret it narrowly.³⁵⁷ Scholars also argue that victim states have the right to take responsive measures even in response to lesser forms of force in a proportional manner.³⁵⁸ For instance, in an expansive view, in the *Oil Platform* case, Judge Simma argued that victim states should not be forced to not defend themselves against the use of force against them, because the principle of proportionality is able to contain escalation of incidents.³⁵⁹ Russia also takes an expansive view when dealing with the right to self-defense in cyberattacks, because it doesn't differentiate between graver and lesser forms of armed attack.³⁶⁰ The United States takes a narrow view for dealing with the right to self-defense in cyberattacks.³⁶¹ It said that, if a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge the victim nation if it concluded that it was a victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.³⁶² Schmitt is of the narrow view; he says that, in cases of cyberattacks where the intentions of the perpetrators is to cause the destruction of property or human life (armed attacks that threaten the stability and peace of the world), the right to self-defense is permissible.³⁶³ On the other hand, Sharp, from an expansive view, believes that right to self-defense and the 2019] CYBERWARFARE On theoretical grounds, Dinniss shares the narrow interpretation, which allows the use of responsive force only in situations of grave forms of armed force.[367] In this approach, most cyberattacks—even those that cause damage to property or human life as lesser forms of use of force—do not amount to armed attacks; therefore, there is no right to self-defense against them.[368] For instance, the cyberattacks in Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet virus in 2010 did cause damage to intrinsic government properties and can be considered uses of force.[369] But, since the gravity of the destruction they caused was moderate, they did not amount to an armed attack and did not give rise to the right to the responsive use of force in self-defense.[370] However, there remains a question of attribution in cyberattacks, since most cyberattacks cannot be attributed to a state and are conducted by nonstate actors, and there is no right to self-defense against the use of force by nonstate actors until and unless their actions are attributable to a state.[371] Similarly, for all cyberattacks, if attribution to a state is not conclusive, there is no right to self-defense against any cyberwarfare.[372] In conclusion, the defensive use of force against cyberattacks is only permissible in cases that amount to an equivalent damage of an armed attack, which entails a graver form of the use of force, with the severe effects and scale of destruction of property and human life.[373] However, this Article concludes that, even in lesser forms of the use of force with TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW [Vol. 28] cyberattacks that can destroy property or human life, a victim state has the right to self-defense, and the right to employ similar and proportionate use of force, be it in the form of responsive cyberattacks or by claiming rightful sovereignty and political independence. Lesser forms of the use of force with cyberattacks do violate the principle of nonintervention and the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore, a victim state can either take proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council to take appropriate measures against the aggressor state.³⁷⁴ ## V. CONCLUSION Though the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹ ³⁷⁴. *Id.* ³⁷⁵.

INTRODUCTION\n\nGlobally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks.\nIn this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?\n1.

Part IV will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThough the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹\n³⁷⁴. *Id.*\n³⁷⁵.

    "TULANE J. OF INT'L &amp; COMP. LAW\n[Vol. 28]\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nGlobally, more than 2.7 billion people use the Internet,¹ and most developed countries rely on computer systems to serve their critical national infrastructure, putting at risk their national security. In this setting even the most capable countries are vulnerable to cyberattacks.² Therefore, the international community is worried about security, defense, and the capacity to prevent cyberattacks.³ The United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructure, which provide services in the civil and military domains.⁴ For instance, the Stuxnet virus used by the United States and Israel to target Iranian nuclear facilities caused the destruction of numerous centrifuges; malware—used by Israel and the United States—disrupted Syrian radar system data and enabled Israeli fighter jets to enter sovereign Syrian airspace to carry out armed attacks;⁵ and the Estonia attack compromised and halted government services, banking systems, and media in that country.⁶ These examples of cyberattacks are a threat to national security. At present, cyberwarfare is taking place and aggressive states have set up dedicated cyberintelligence units to wage wars against other states to serve their geopolitical interests.⁷ So the most relevant question here is what the applicable legal framework is to regulate and prevent cyberattacks.⁸ It is pertinent to note here that cyberattacks by nonstate actors (especially those that cannot be attributed to any state) are not within the scope of this Article, which is to analyze the jus ad bellum of cyberattacks.\n\nIn this context, this Article will try to explore three main dimensions of cyberattacks: (1) What is the nature of the threat posed by cyberattacks?\n\n1.

(3) What are the applicable international laws that can regulate or prevent cyberattacks? For these purposes, this Article is divided into three main Parts. Part II will explain the severity and nature of the threats posed by cyberattacks, by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. Part III will discuss general principles and integral concepts under international laws applicable to cyberattacks. Part IV will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks.\n\n## II. THREATS\n\nThis Part will explain the severity and nature of threats posed by cyberattacks by discussing various kinds of cyberattacks. It is divided into three sections: Section A will discuss espionage using cyberattacks as a threat to nations; Section B will discuss terrorism through cyberattacks as a threat; and Section C will discuss other cyberoperations employed by aggressive states against victim states.\n\n### A. Espionage\n\nThe prevalence⁹ of cyberespionage is emerging as a threat to the peace and security of the world. Currently, the Internet or cyberspace is considered a “gift from God” for surveillance and espionage purposes,¹⁰ and this age has been called a “golden age for espionage.”¹¹ In cyberespionage, unauthorized states and nonstate actors infiltrate computer information systems to collect confidential information.¹² Cyberespionage can be defined as “[o]perations and related programs or activities conducted . . . in or through cyberspace, for the primary purpose of collecting intelligence . . . from, computers, information or communication systems, or networks, with the intent to remain\n\n9.

Charter (prohibition on the use of force in other states) should be interpreted as including cyberespionage.⁴⁰ Similarly, Alexander Melnitzky also believes that the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the U.N.

Counter-Terrorism Implementation Taskforce (CTITF) defines cyberterrorism as “terrorist attacks by remotely altering information on a computer system or disrupting the flow of data between computer systems.”44 An example of computer system controlling infrastructure is the Supervisory Control and Data system (SCADA), which monitors and controls traffic systems, railroad switches, gas and electricity distribution networks, and water purification plants.45 The unauthorized use of SCADA by hacking can be considered cyberterrorism.46\n\nGeneral international laws47—prohibiting states from intervening in other states, using force, and launching terrorist activities from their states—are, by using the principle of state responsibility, flexible enough to incorporate a prohibition on cyberterrorism.48 For instance, there have been discussions on a prohibition on using force and armed attack in other states, and on whether the use of force in self-defense encompasses cyberterrorism.49 Specifically, more serious cyberattacks by state militaries against other states without an armed conflict come under the prohibition on the use of force.50 Likewise, instruments of national and regional51 laws also incorporate prohibition on the offense undertaken by cyber means, such as fraud, extortion, terrorism, stalking attacks on information systems, and misuse of computers.52 The Association of South East Asian Nationals (ASEAN) Convention on Counter Terrorism (2007)\n\n43.

The facilitation of terrorism⁵⁵ includes the recruitment of terrorists, the coordination of their activities, financing their operations, and the incitement of terrorism.⁵⁶ Therefore, instruments of international organizations also prohibit the facilitation of terrorism through cyber means.⁵⁷ For instance, UNSC Resolution 1624 (2005) prohibits the incitement of terrorism;⁵⁸ the EU Framework Decision (2008)⁵⁹ requires EU states to criminalize the provocation, recruitment, and training of terrorism; and UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001)⁶⁰ and the Terrorist Financing Convention (1999)⁶¹ prohibit raising or distributing funds for, and financing, terrorism. UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001) also requires the exchange of operational information regarding communication and technologies used by terrorists,⁶² which was supported by the unanimous adoption of a UNGA resolution for coordinating “efforts at the international and regional levels to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the internet.”⁶³ As a result, UNCTITF produced a “taskforce” and “detailed research” on the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes.⁶⁴\n\nSaul and Heath argue that, although there is no specific convention or treaty that explicitly prohibits or covers cyberterrorism, other general\n\n53.

Cyberoperations\n\nWhistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange have revealed to the world that cyberwarfare/cyberoperations are currently the biggest threat⁷⁶ to governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. Under these activities using cyberspace, governments and corporations⁷⁷ are proactively and preventively monitoring,⁷⁸ collecting, and investigating⁷⁹ data of all the aforementioned subjects. For instance, corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and AOL are collecting and monitoring the data⁸⁰ of its users for economic profit, for future business aspects, and to collaborate with intelligence services.⁸¹ Owing to the deep analytical artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of Google, fueled by the data of all its users regarding their political proclivities, likes and dislikes, daily routines, and query searches, it is said that Google knows an individual more than that individual knows themselves.⁸²\n\nWarlike cyberoperations and cyber activities are often referred to as cyberattacks, and their militarization under the patronage of intelligence agencies is characterized as cyberwarfare.⁸³ Cyberwarfare is defined by Michael Schmitt as the “employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving [military] objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”⁸⁴ The Netherlands has defined cyberwarfare as “the conduct of military operations to disrupt, mislead, modify or destroy an opponent’s computer systems or networks by means of cyber capabilities.”⁸⁵ The United Kingdom’s (UK’s) view is that “cyber warfare can enable actors to achieve their political and strategic goals without the need for armed conflict.”⁸⁶ Schmitt’s definition generally focuses on the use of cyberspace\n\n76.

Cyberspace &amp; National Jurisdiction\n\nCyberspace is defined as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹²⁷ This definition does not cover the software side of the cyberspace; more aptly, cyberspace can be defined as “a global domain within the information environment whose distinctive and unique character is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via independent and interconnected networks using information-communication technologies.”¹²⁸ Cyberspace has three layers; its first layer includes physical infrastructure such as computers, circuits, and cables; its second layer consists of “software”; and its third layer involves “data packets and electronics.”¹²⁹\n\nFrom an international law perspective, the key questions are whether cyberspace is subject to sovereignty and whether cyberspace is sovereign itself.

For example, in an English court, a U.S. publisher was convicted for publishing obscenity and violating the obscenity laws of the U.K.¹⁴⁹ In a German court, a Dutch seller was convicted of selling drugs online and violating German laws, even though the drug concerned was legal in the Netherlands, because the “origin rule” didn’t apply here owing to the protection of public health.¹⁵⁰ Similarly, an English defendant was held liable in a Dutch court for violating Dutch license laws that prohibited making a gambling site accessible in the Netherlands.¹⁵¹ An Australian court also found an American site guilty of defamation caused in Australia despite being in a U.S. publication,¹⁵² and the same approach was taken by an English court against Harrods Ltd.¹⁵³ Similarly, an English court held Google responsible for collecting the data of English residents without their consent;¹⁵⁴ later, Spain took a similar approach against Google for violating data protection laws.¹⁵⁵ For data protection, states like Iran and China have completely banned certain websites including Facebook and YouTube.¹⁵⁶\n\nOn the other hand, Johnson and Post propose that cyberspace should not be subject to sovereignty and must be self-regulating.¹⁵⁷ However, cyberspace cannot be considered sovereign itself, because it does not have any central authority to make and enforce laws, and it does not have its\n\n147.

State Responsibility\n\nState responsibility is a principle of international law¹⁶³ that includes acts or omissions attributable to a state and breaches of obligations under international law.¹⁶⁴ These breaches can be undertaken by groups, organizations, or individual beings on behalf of a state.¹⁶⁵ First, it should be seen whether the action or omission is undertaken by the organs of a state. If not, then it should be seen whether the action or omission by individuals or organizations had been undertaken on the direction of a state.¹⁶⁶ Even in cases where the organs of states exceed the authority granted by their state, this can give rise to state responsibility.¹⁶⁷ In the Bosnian Genocide case, the International Court of Justice found that, even when an organization had no international recognition as a state organ, the effective control by the state and the fact that the state in question had given precise instructions to the organization were enough to prove state responsibility for the violations of international law by the organization acting on behalf of the state.¹⁶⁸ In this case, the ICJ did not uphold the “overall control” test formulated by the Tardic case, which required the state’s full control and, where that is absent, stipulated that\n\n158.

For instance, Germany accused the U.K. and the United States of violating international law by using their embassies in Berlin for international cybersurveillance.¹⁷⁷ Similarly, a number of U.S. embassies in Asia and Europe collected the data of their host states.¹⁷⁸ In such cases, there is a possibility that accused states could deny liability because they used proxies to undertake such attacks.¹⁷⁹ Therefore, in cyberspace cases, victim states are allowed a more liberal procedure to infer evidential circumstances.¹⁸⁰ For example, the climate of political relationships may allow some insight in sudden cyberattacks, with a reverse burden of proof allowed.¹⁸¹ Since the attribution laws are a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks, there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy for other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.¹⁸²\n\n169.

Examples of such acts are surveillance and espionage by state organs or individuals from other states.¹⁸³ However, espionage is not prohibited under international law, and some further proof of damage to another state is required to establish a breach of an international obligation in cyberspace.¹⁸⁴ Nevertheless, where something is not mentioned in international law, that does not mean that something is entirely permissible; in fact, no state claims that espionage is a lawful act.¹⁸⁵ In some cases, the concept of attribution is inapplicable, where de facto organs/agents of states and concerns of failures to act are involved; here, the notion of due diligence is applicable.¹⁸⁶ Article 14 of ARS explicitly includes instances of failing to act, with reference to state responsibility, because the state is responsible for preventing all crimes emanating from its territories, if there is a persistent risk of it reoccurring.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, states cannot knowingly allow their territory to be used to violate international law, and they must take reasonable steps to prevent such activities.¹⁸⁸\n\n## IV. JUS AD BELLUM\n\nThis Part will mainly discuss the *jus ad bellum* of cyberattacks. It will start by exploring the criteria by which cyberattacks can be considered the “use of force” and “armed force,” while providing relevant definitions, *opinio juris*, and legal analyses on the subject. Then, it will analyze whether cyberattacks can be viewed as “armed attacks” and whether they can give rise to the right to self-defense. This Part is divided into three sections: Section A will provide a brief contextual analysis of the use of force and the international laws with regard to cyberwarfare; Section B will define the notion of the “use of force” in relation to cyberattacks, and\n\n183.

Security Council,²⁰⁹ inscribed under Articles 51 and 39-41 of the U.N. Charter, respectively. This next Section will explore what conditions need to be met for cyberattacks to be deemed the “use of force” for the purposes of Article 2(4) and as an “armed attack” for the purposes of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. In addition, the Section will also discuss the elements that shape the conditions of applying the rules of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n\n## B. Use of Force\n\nCyberattacks amounting to an “armed attack” or the “use of force” can violate the Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force and therein can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.²¹⁰ The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare clearly states that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”²¹¹ The United States’ legal advisor, Harold Koh, also affirmed that “if the physical consequences of a cyberattack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber-attack should equally be considered a use of force.”²¹² Koh considered cyberattacks resulting in nuclear plant meltdown, dam destruction in populated areas, airplane crashes due to disabled air-traffic to be the use of force.²¹³ These types of destruction caused by cyberattacks are indirect in nature,²¹⁴ but the ICJ in the Nicaragua case had established that the use of force can be indirect in nature.²¹⁵ The 1982 installation of malware software, causing the destruction of a gas pipeline in Soviet Serbia by the United States’ CIA, and the Stuxnet virus by the United States and Israel, damaging nuclear centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities, are examples of cyberattacks that can cause destruction equivalent to the\n\n207.

Charter.²⁴⁵ The inclusion of cyberattacks under economic and political coercions is flawed because the latter employs the economy as a weapon to pressure states by political and diplomatic means, and the former uses malware direct attacks as instruments to destroy targeted structures.²⁴⁶ Roscini questions why, when a kinetic bomb employed to destroy a financial institution is surely an armed attack, the same result by cyberattacks and the use of another weapon of choice should be considered any less.²⁴⁷\n\n237.

Richard Aldrich and Tom Farer conclude that the general prohibition on economic and political coercion under the OAS Charter are unenforceable,²⁵⁵ because it even outlaws all diplomatic measures by deeming them political coercion.²⁵⁶ Similar to the OAS Charter, the U.K. also believes that political and economic coercion should not be treated under the principle of prohibition on the use of force, but instead threats to political independence and sovereignty within such coercion should be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention in other states.²⁵⁷ For these reasons, all types of coercions should be seen as different from the use of force.²⁵⁸\n\n248.

Result-Based Approach\n\nScholarly opinion is divided on what perspective or approach should be used to analyze the emerging threat of cyberattacks in the form of cyberwarfare. Brownlie believes that the use of force must employ a weapon that can cause the destruction of property or human injury.²⁹⁰ Weapons can be defined as instruments that are capable of destruction²⁹¹ and are used for destruction²⁹² or violence.²⁹³ Weapons are, therefore, “instruments that produce violent consequences.”²⁹⁴ Weapons are determined by their result and not by their mechanism.²⁹⁵ Ian Bowett also\n\n---\n\n286.

Target-Based Approach\n\nThe target-based approach argues that all cyberattacks that intercept information or structures that are critical to national security, such as CNI, are a use of force and armed attack,³¹⁰ even in circumstances where there is no physical damage caused.³¹¹ As Walter G. Sharp argues, the non-armed use of force such as cyberattacks on critically important information even have the capacity to cause more damage than actual/physical armed attacks.³¹² Conversely, the international community does not share Sharp’s expansive interpretation of cyberattacks; instead, international law sees such intrusions as acts of espionage and not as the use of force or armed attack.³¹³\n\n## 5. Instrument-Based Approach\n\nThis approach argues that only the use of traditional or conventional weapons can amount to the use of force, and cyberattacks can never be considered the use of force even in cases where it causes physical damage, because it merely uses computer coding in cyberspace instead of kinetic weapons.³¹⁴ Scholars believe that such an approach is “ill-suited” for\n\n306.

Charter. If a murder is committed by using a pen to stab a victim in his chest or neck, the instrument-based approach will conclude that, since a pen is not a traditional weapon, this death cannot be considered murder. However, a reasonable legal analysis will consider the intentions behind using a pen and will conclude that the pen in this case is a weapon of choice, through which a murder was carried out.³²⁰ Ultimately, the ICJ has established that uses of force “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”³²¹\n\n## 6. Contextualist Approach\n\nThe contextualist approach, used by Michael Schmitt and Michael Reisman, proposes that all sorts of coercion are based on a variety of factors and therefore should be analyzed in relation to the world order.³²² Schmitt argues that the choice of instrument in a coercion does not matter; instead, its consequences do.³²³ In a way, when Schmitt’s argument relies on the consequences of coercion, disregarding the weapon of choice, his argument is strikingly similar to the result-based approach, which also ignores the means and method and concludes by analyzing the results of the damage caused.³²⁴ From a contextualized perspective, Reisman and Myres McDougal argue that coercions should be categorized in legal and illegal coercions,³²⁵ based on the characteristics amplifying or\n\n315.

Positivist Approach\n\nIn the positivist approach, writers such as Yoram Dinstein, Ian Brownlie, and Christine Gray argue that anything that is not covered in the prohibition on the use of force is legally allowed and permitted.³³⁰ However, such conclusions create a gray area to be exploited by aggressive states, where developed nations can use their international influence to subjugate developing nations to serve their own political interests, compromising the political independence and sovereignty of victim states. However, it is pertinent to note that the positivist approach is limited to the context of the Article 2(4) prohibition of the use of force in other states.³³¹ Therefore, threats to political independence and sovereignty other than the use of force can still be treated as a threat to the international peace and security of the world;³³² from a positivist approach it should just not be included within the parameters of using force.\n\n³²⁶.

Factors Influencing Cyberattacks\n\nDinniss has identified four key factors that influence the legitimacy of cyberattacks: “indirectness, intangibility, locus and result.”³³³ Under “indirectness,” cyberattacks can have indirect knock-on effects, such as changing the settings of a dam to release floodwater, or they can use proxies to indirectly present an innocent state as the culprit of such attacks.³³⁴ Under the laws of the use of force, indirect assistance to armed activities through assistance can be considered the use of force.³³⁵ Under “intangibility,” Dinniss notes that the nature of cyberattacks is such that often “the target, the weapon used and as well the damage caused” are intangible and only exist in cyberspace or a nonphysical form, such as targeting information systems, collapsing systems, and manipulating them by computer code.³³⁶ Here a weapon can be described as something used to gain advantage in a conflict, causing damage to property or persons.³³⁷ Under this definition, malicious cyber code used in a cyberattack/cyberwarfare, causing damage to property, can be considered a weapon.³³⁸ Consider the criminal law analyses of a weapon; for instance, a wrench in the hand of a mechanic can be considered only a tool, or also a weapon for murder if used for striking the life out of a victim, based on its use and consequential results.³³⁹ In a very similar fashion, computer code can be considered a weapon of choice if it is used with the intention and result of destroying property or life.³⁴⁰ Under “locus,” a cross-border use of force is necessary to violate the prohibition on the use of force.³⁴¹ Dinniss argues that, although cyberspace does not come under any jurisdiction, and the conclusive attribution is difficult and often impossible to establish, the cyberattacks do cross the borders of different states.³⁴² For instance, the perpetrators of cyberattacks use proxies of different countries before targeting victims, and usually the malware is sent by aggressive states into computer systems located in the sovereign territory of victim states.³⁴³ Under “result,” Dinniss maintains that, though the results of cyberattacks\n\n333.

Armed Attack and Self-Defense\n\nArmed attacks are the uses of force by armed bands, with sufficient gravity of scale and effect beyond mere frontier skirmishes.³⁵² The UNGA has defined aggression as “the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force,” including nondestructive actions such as breaching a treaty, providing land to an aggressor, and allocating a naval blockade.³⁵³ ICJ also established that “arming and training armed groups” is also a use\n\n344.

Lesser forms of the use of force with cyberattacks do violate the principle of nonintervention and the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore, a victim state can either take proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council to take appropriate measures against the aggressor state.³⁷⁴\n\n## V. CONCLUSION\n\nThough the legal international framework was formed before the advent of the information age, the international law of using force under the U.N. Charter is well applicable to cyberattacks and cyberwarfare.³⁷⁵ This Article concludes that the use of cyberattacks can be considered the use of force and, as armed attacks, can violate Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter and can give rise to the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, when the gravity of their destruction of property or human life is equivalent to the destruction caused by kinetic weapons.³⁷⁶ Moreover, cyberattacks entailing the nonphysical destruction of property and life, such as disabling CNI/services by cyberattacks, is also the use of armed force³⁷⁷ in the form of coercions. Under the Tallinn Manual,³⁷⁸ result-based and target-based approaches categorize most cyberattacks as armed attacks, with the qualification giving rise to the right to use responsive force in self-defense,³⁷⁹ keeping in mind the principle of proportionality. Hitherto, the most rigorous challenge regarding the legitimacy of the responsive use of force entails that aggressive armed attack via cyberattack is conclusively attributable to a state. Without attribution, there can be no self-defense against states—or nonstate actors residing in other countries—without the consent of that state.³⁸⁰ The principle of attribution acts as a gray area in international law for the purposes of cyberattacks; therefore there has been a rise of nonstate actors acting independently, or as a proxy of other states, rendering it very difficult for victim states to respond in self-defense.³⁸¹\n\n³⁷⁴. *Id.*\n\n³⁷⁵.

    "2019]\nCYBERWARFARE\n39\n\nFurther, states’ intended cyberattacks³⁸² with lesser gravity, not destroying life or property and not disabling CNI/services, but coercing states into doing something that the victim country is free to do or not do,³⁸³ may still violate the principle of sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention in internal affairs of a country.³⁸⁴ Moreover, cyberattacks on information can be considered espionage, and they also violate the sovereignty of a state, but such attacks cannot be considered the use of force or an intervention in other countries, because such attacks have no destructive capabilities and they do not coerce states into doing something upon matters upon which they are free to decide.³⁸⁵ Information-targeting cyberattacks not amounting to the use of force can instead be considered espionage, as international crimes, and as threats to the peace, security, and stability of the international community.\n\n---\n\n382.
