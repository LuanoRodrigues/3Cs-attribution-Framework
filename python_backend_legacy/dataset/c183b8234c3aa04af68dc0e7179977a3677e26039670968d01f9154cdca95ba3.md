In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.\nKeywords: Cyber operations, Disinformation, Information Warfare, Intelligence Disclosures, Volunteer Cyber Army\n# Introduction\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered into Ukrainian sovereign territory in what was termed a 'special military operation'. This had followed weeks of the forces building up along the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus, which were claimed to be exercises with denials on any impending military action against Ukraine. The broader conflict began in 2014 after anti-government protests from late 2013 successfully ousted the pro-Russian government in Kyiv. The Russian annexation of Crimea occurred shortly thereafter, followed by a low-intensity conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Alongside these activities in the physical domain, the conflict was also occurring in the information domain.\nThere is no consistent approach to the concept of information warfare (IW), which has also undergone evolution over the last two decades. For the purposes of this article, IW is considered to be an encompassing concept of activities in the physical, logical, and cognitive domains that seek to impact or protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (van Niekerk 2015). Information warfare can be considered to be comprised of:\n- Cyber operations\n- Influence operations, disinformation, propaganda, and psychological operations\n- Electronic warfare\n- Intelligence\nJournal of Information Warfare (2023) 22.1: 10-31\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nThe article considers openly available reports of IW activity during the conflict in Ukraine to illustrate the evolution of tactics from 2014 up to and including 2022. The next section provides an overview of key IW activity in the 2014 crisis and annexation of Crimea. This is followed by the relevant activity between the main events of 2014 and 2022. The next section covers the IW activity during the 2022 conflict. Thereafter, a discussion to highlight the key evolutions of IW is conducted, and the article is then concluded.\n# Information Warfare in the 2014 Protests and the Annexation of Crimea\nThe use of IW in the 2014 Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea were discussed in-depth previously by the author (van Niekerk 2015). This section will provide a summary of key points from that chapter, which provides as a baseline against which the IW activities in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict can be benchmarked. The crisis in Ukraine began at the end of 2013 with protests against the pro-Russian government, during which social media played a role. In 2014, as the protests continued, security forces became violent, resulting in the protests intensifying and the situation escalating. Eventually the Ukrainian president fled to Russia, and a new government was installed by 23 February 2014. However, pro-Russian protests began, and social media was used to divide ethnic Russians by spreading fear, which the new government did not address. A week later, armed militia began seizing key points in Crimea, and, in early March, a video emerged of Russian-made military equipment entering Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied the forces were theirs, but by 16 March a referendum had been held, claiming that the majority of Crimeans wished to join Russia, completing the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Subsequently, pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine began seizing buildings and a period of low-intensity conflict began, during which the downing of MH17 occurred. The diplomatic response to these actions was the implementation and increasing sanctions on Russia, and Russia putting pressure on Ukraine to pay for gas supplies.\nThe protests in Ukraine were a useful case study, as they could be benchmarked against the Orange Revolution of 2004, prior to extensive use of social media in popular uprisings. This comparison illustrated that social media gave anti-government protestors and journalists a platform for mass-dissemination of information outside of the state-controlled traditional media, and that the protestors found this information more reliable than formal news platforms (Onuch 2014; Satell 2014). During the incursion in Crimea, Russian media made numerous claims which indicated chaos and mass defections in Ukraine, many of which were shown to be inaccurate; in addition, images began showing that the forces in Crimea were in fact Russian, as images of the same individuals were shown from the Russian incursion into Georgia in 2008 (van Niekerk 2015). A key perspective was provided by Kates and Butorin (2014), who indicated that the Russian media was providing a reality to their target audience, namely the Russian population, in order to maintain support, and this did not necessarily align with reality. This was generally successful as a majority of the Russian population trusted the Russian media, and the persistent rhetoric dominated over other sources provided an 'alternate' truth (Kates &amp; Butorin 2014). The use of pro-Russian 'trolls' to discredit social media and blog posters was reported, indicating attempts to dominate the narrative on social media and online (chornajuravka 2014).\nCyber operations were present prior to and during the annexation of Crimea, in particular cyber-espionage, distributed denial of service attacks, and website defacements. Cyber-espionage campaigns were present well before the crisis in 2013/2014, with a number of campaigns targeting Ukraine and other nations within the Russian sphere of influence and with another cyber-espionage\nJournal of Information Warfare\ncampaign predominantly targeting Ukraine in 2013 and 2014 (van Niekerk 2015). One particular cyber-espionage campaign of 2013 bears specific mention in that the lure was fake Ukrainian foreign policy documents purporting to show Ukraine's plans to seek NATO membership (Mimoso 2013). As the narratives giving rise to the tensions in 2014, and as discussed later in 2022, this theme becomes core. Webpage defacements had begun in early November 2013, pre-dating the protests; however, the themes are worth recognition in the context of this article: the defacement of Ukrainian government websites and the distribution of false emails both contained a message claiming to be from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Kovacs 2013). During the initial stages of armed incursion in Crimea, webpage defacements targeting the Russian government and organisations routinely used the term ‘Nazi” (van Niekerk 2015).\nThe most common cyber incident was DDoS attacks. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was targeted in retaliation for the alleged hacks mentioned above (Kovacs 2013). A notable tactic was the use of DDoS attacks in conjunction with physical attacks against the communication infrastructure during the early stages of the armed incursion into Crimea, which disrupted the Ukrainian forces' based in Crimea ability to communicate; in addition, mobile phones of the Ukrainian parliament were disrupted (Vamosi 2014). This tactic was seen previously in the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The DDoS attacks also became prevalent prior to the scheduled Crimean referendum to join Russia—although the majority of DDoS incidents were claimed by hacktivist groups (van Niekerk 2015). Commentary on the cyber incidents surrounding the Ukrainian political crisis and the annexation of Crimea indicated surprise about the limited and constrained use of cyber operations by Russia, with suggestions that the Ukrainian hackers were more skilled and could mount stronger retaliations (Clayton 2014a; Gady 2014).\nIn May 2014, there was an attempt to disrupt and interfere with the Ukrainian 2014 presidential election. Clayton (2014b) indicates attempts were made to delete data, leak information, alter the voting totals (with the use of malware), and then disrupt access with a DDoS attack. The attack was attributed to a pro-Russian hacktivist group; however, this has been refuted (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). A disinformation operation was coordinated with the attempt to alter voting data, as a Russian news channel incorrectly reported a win of the pro-Russian candidate with the same voting percentages that the above-mentioned malware attempted to insert into the voting platform. This implies a concerted effort to use cyber operations and disinformation to ‘hijack' the election in a way that aligned with the Russian propaganda narrative (Clayton 2014b).\nThe use of electronic warfare appeared limited, with only a single report, which claimed that Russian satellite television had been jammed (Rehle 2014). From an intelligence perspective, social media proved to be useful for open source intelligence; where videos of troop movements appeared, selfies aided in identifying possible Russian troops and aided in attribution for the downing of flight MH17 (van Niekerk 2015).\nIn summary, the IW activities in 2014 began exhibiting boarder coordination amongst cyber operations, the propaganda effort, and physical operations on the ground. The IW operations did not stop, but a few notable incidents occurred between the major events of 2014 and 2022, which will be covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the ‘Inter-War' Period\nBetween the main events of 2014, as described above, and the direct military conflict in 2022\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(discussed in the next section), a number of information warfare activities occurred that were notable. Of key interest are a series of cyber operations which demonstrated the potential for significant impact and disruption through cyber means, and some foreshadowed other similar events that occurred subsequently.\nIn December of both 2015 and 2016, malware impacted parts of the Ukrainian electricity grid, resulting in a loss of power to the areas serviced by the affected substations. In 2015, 16 substations were affected, disrupting the electricity supply for up to six hours for over 200,000 customers. This malware was attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Sandworm (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In 2016 another APT, known as Electrum with reported links to the Sandworm APT, caused a shorter disruption, which affected about a fifth of Kyiv's supply. However, the functionality of the malware indicated the potential for causing broader cascading effects across the power grid (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Dragos 2017). In October 2016 it was reported that a Ukrainian hacktivist group had conducted a 'hack and leak' operation against a senior Russian official's emails, which provided evidence that Russia was involved in the 2014 separatist movements (Kramer 2016).\nIn June 2017, a modified version of the Petya ransomware appeared to target Ukrainian organisations, but then rapidly spread globally in what is the most expensive cyber incident recorded. The malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability, used by the WannaCry ransomware worm the month before, but it was also modified so the encryption was irreversible, resulting in it being renamed NotPetya and reclassified as a wiper. While NotPetya was known for its global financial impact that exceeded 10 billion USD and disrupted shipping company Maersk, it impacted a number of Ukrainian organisations, including radiation monitoring at Chernobyl (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Greenberg 2018). In 2018, a water filtration plant experienced a cyber operation attributed to Russia, which was reportedly fended off. The operation employed the VPNFilter malware that targeted networking devices (Osborne 2018). Slowik (2018) indicates that the technical details are scarce, and the fact that the malware originally could only intercept traffic and not modify it indicates that this may have been intelligence gathering to prepare for a cyber operation against the plant, rather than being able to affect the integrity of the industrial systems in any way.\nUkraine has been described as a 'testing ground' for cyber operations: in addition to the widely reported Russian cyber operations, there are a multitude of cyber-espionage operations reported in Eastern Ukraine ostensibly collecting intelligence on the situation there (Cerulus 2019). The cyber operations described above exhibit a worrying trend, in that industrial controls systems could be targeted and could cause disruption to critical infrastructure; also of concern is the scale of the 'collateral damage' that NotPetya caused. Such cyber operations are clearly strategic and are intended to target civilian infrastructure, possibly to erode daily functioning of a country as well as the psychological resilience of the population. In this sense, cyber operations are being used, or at least attempted to being used, in a manner similar to strategic bombers of World War II, albeit with more precision and less physical destruction.\nPropaganda was a continuous feature surrounding the separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine, where the narratives echoed that of Russian and former Soviet propaganda, with some echoes of World War II. These narratives also indicate a type of extremist viewpoint, where the separatists portray themselves as heroically protecting their values, but are victims of overwhelming hostile adversaries: primarily Ukraine, supported by the majority of the world (Kostyuchenko &amp; Pushkar\nJournal of Information Warfare\n2022). During the COVID pandemic, the separatist groups spread conspiracy theories to erode confidence in the government measures and also suggested that the U.S. biolabs created the virus (Kostyuchenko et al. 2022). Doroshenko and Lukito (2021) illustrate that pro-Russian influence operations related to Ukraine are an evolution of the Cold War concept of reflexive control for the digital world. These operations engage with the audience in such a way that their decision making is favourable to the objectives of the perpetrator. In an attempt to counter influence operations and propaganda for war in the context of Ukraine, Richter (2015) contends that countries utilised their own local laws, whereas a set of international norms might have proven to be more effective. While little is reported of EW use during this period, Russian EW units have reportedly supported the separatists by distributing propaganda over cellular phone networks in addition to disrupting and detecting (for targeting purposes) Ukrainian communications (Clark 2022).\nWhile IW operations were not as intense in terms of the amount outside of major military operations (or less attention was being paid to the IW activities), they were still present. During this period some of the most notable cyber operations were conducted, namely NotPetya and the attacks against the electric grid, taking a step closer to what could potentially produce a blackout across major portions of a country. These operations appeared to be preparation for what was to come in 2022, which is covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Conflict\nDue to the amount of information available about the IW efforts in the 2022 conflict, this section will be divided to focus on specific areas; however, there may still be overlaps (for example cyber-enabled influence operations). Cyber operations are discussed first, followed by influence operations, and then a section on other notable IW activities during the conflict.\n## Cyber operations\nThe number of recorded cyber operations for the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict is notable; it is possible that there was more activity, but at the same time there was more attention to cyber operations during the conflict. The CyberPeace Institute (2022b) has an interactive portal dedicated to tracking cyber incidents during the conflict, and recorded 626 alleged incidents in 2022 related to the Ukraine conflict; this averages to nearly two incidents per day.\nIn January there were some wiper attacks, website defacements of government websites, and attempts to compromise government organisations. In February, incidents of cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, and disinformation were reported. Immediately preceding the invasion (23 February), more DDoS attacks, wipers, and ransomware were reported. During the initial stages of the Russian incursion into Ukraine (24-25 February), DDoS, wipers, phishing, social media-based disinformation, and website compromises were seen; the DDoS attacks and disinformation continued to late February, and in early March cyber operations targeted the media and communications sector, and malware targeted non-government organisations (CyberPeace Institute 2022b).\nFigure 1 illustrates the composition of the 626 cyber-operations recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), categorised into 10 incident types from January to October. As is evident from the figure, the majority of the incidents were DDoS, followed by hack and leak operations. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalent categories of 201 cyber incidents that targeted Ukraine; the 158 incidents that targeted Russia are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 illustrates the categories of 267 incidents\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nrelated to the conflict that targeted nations or organisations globally. DDoS attacks were the most prevalent type, targeting Ukraine and global targets, while hack and leak operations were the most prevalent against Russia.\nFigure 1: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 2: Types of cyber operations targeting Ukraine, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 3: Types of cyber operations targeting Russia, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 4: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict targeting the rest of the world, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of cyber incidents per month. Those targeting Ukraine began in January, increased in February, with an initial peak in March. Many of these may have been preparatory in nature, as with previous conflicts, to disrupt communication and disseminate disinformation in an attempt to dominate the information sphere during the early stages of the conflict. Those targeting Russia began in February, with an increase in March, and initial peak in April. These lagged the incidents against Ukraine by a month, and were probably retaliatory in nature. The incidents with global impact began in January, with a slight increase in February, peaking in April. However, the decline was slower than that of Russia and Ukraine. All areas experienced second peaks from August to October.\nFigure 5: Number of cyber operations targeting the belligerents (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 6 illustrates the number of incidents for each category per month. Due to the number of DDoS incidents, these are shown on a separate graph. The DDoS attacks peaked drastically in August and September, to an extent that they overshadowed some of the other categories. In January, wipers and defacement were most prevalent, with cyber espionage and wipers being the most prevalent in March and April. This speaks to how cyber operations are used by Russia. The use of volunteers for Ukraine is discussed in more detail later. A report by Microsoft concurred that most destructive attacks (for example, wipers) occurred in the first week of the conflict, and  $40\\%$  of the destructive attacks targeted critical infrastructure (Digital Security Unit 2022).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\n(b) DDoS and total\nFigure 6: Types of cyber operations per month (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFrom Figure 7, it is evident that hacking collectives are by far the most prevalent threat actor type, followed by nation-state actors. This further demonstrates the role of non-state actors in the cyber domain during the conflict. Of the 65 unique threat actors identified by the CyberPeace Institute, 38 were supporting Russia and 27 were supporting Ukraine. Two interesting threat actors supporting Russia originated from Brazil and Iraq (CyberPeace Institute 2022), which falls outside of the usual online belligerents related to the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The weighting towards the\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\ncollectives is not necessarily unusual; however, Ukraine did follow a strategy of openly calling for international cyber volunteers to support its cyber operations (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022). This, however, raises concerns that, while such volunteers and hacktivists are often seen during times of heightened political tension, their presence when there is an actual physical conflict could unintentionally involve countries that are essentially neutral, or the cyber volunteers could potentially be classified as mercenaries or combatants and open themselves (and the country they reside in) to retaliation. In addition to the volunteers, cybercriminal groups openly chose sides (Ilascu 2022). However, a ransomware gang that declared its support for Russia experienced leaks of information, thought to be Ukrainian members of the group retaliating; these leaks provided useful insights into the operations of ransomware groups (Pitrelli 2022).\nFigure 7: Types of threat actors (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 8 illustrates the types of cyber operations that each threat actor type was conducting. The collectives overwhelmingly favoured DDoS and hack and leak operations; nation state actors accounted for more cyber espionage, 'other' incidents, and wipers. Given the timing of the hack and leak operations shown in Figure 6(a), and the prevalence of hack and leak operations against Russia (Figure 3) and that they were committed by collectives, it can be deduced that these may have been volunteers targeting Russia in retaliation for the invasion and the for the support of cyber operations. Similarly, globally there were a number of DDoS attacks from August to October (Figure 6[a]), also conducted by collectives. These largely affected global targets, but also Ukraine and Russia. Some of these DDoS attacks could have grown out of frustration by pro-Russian groups of the waning support to Russia; for example, multiple websites of the Bulgarian Government were targeted for what the perpetrator claimed was the Bulgarian betrayal of Russia (Antoniuk 2022). A situation may have arisen where various hacking collectives began targeting countries as a series of reprisals; van Niekerk and Maharaj (2011) predicted this as a likely occurrence in a cyber conflict, based on a series of retaliatory cyber incidents in support of either Wikileaks or the U.S. government in 2010.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(b) DDoS and Total\nFigure 8: Types of incident per threat actor type (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nSome notable incidents include a cyber operation against a broadband satellite provider, Viasat, on 24 February (Page 2022; Urchill 2022). This illustrates a continuation of the practice of targeting media and communication platforms alongside the initial military operations. In addition to significant damage to the terminals at Viasat, the 'collateral damage' of the incident affected parts of Europe, including remote access to over 5000 wind turbines in Germany (Page 2022). A border control station between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly affected by a wiper malware on 25 February, slowing down the processing of Ukrainian refugees (Berger 2022). A number of cyber operations against industrial systems were reported: Belarusian hacktivist collectives claimed that they targeted railway systems to hinder Russian troop movements (Gallagher &amp; Bloomberg 2022); cyber operations (which ultimately failed) targeting power companies that included wiper malware as well as an updated version of the malware used to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 were found, (ESET Research 2022; Goodchild 2022). In addition, a Russian taxi operator was compromised and all taxis were instructed to go to the same location in Moscow, causing a traffic jam (Roth 2022). These attacks are outside of the usual website defacements and DDoS attacks that have traditionally been exhibited during times of conflict.\nObservers commented on the lack of visible cyber operations by Russia after the early stages of the conflict, as it was expected by some to have been much greater by several researchers (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022; Schneider 2022). By comparison, Russia appeared a much greater cyber power in relation to Ukraine: the National Cyber Power Index 2020 listed Russia as  $4^{\\text{th}}$  and Ukraine as  $26^{\\text{th}}$  of 30 countries (Voo et al. 2020); therefore, a strong presence by Russia in the cyber arena would have made sense. Proposed reasons for the quieter than expected cyber domain are that, in a physical conflict, kinetic weapons are more useful and cyber operations are more suited for deception and deniability, making them ideal for use outside of open conflict (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022). Urchill (2022) indicates that the attempts against the Ukrainian power grid indicate that cyber operations were active, which negates the growing narrative that they were quiet. The number of cyber incidents recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b) and illustrated by the figures above indicate that there was a significant amount\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof activity. While there were attacks on critical infrastructure, they did not succeed due to (at least in part) assistance that Ukraine received (Goodchild 2022; Landau 2022). In addition to the volunteers supporting Ukraine mentioned above, there was formal foreign assistance, including ‘hunt forward' operations by the U.S. Cyber Command (Janofsky 2022). The scope of the foreign assistance included forward deployments and remote assistance for cyber defence by both vendors and official personnel, the sharing of threat intelligence, and services provided to improve the resilience of Ukrainian systems, such as migrating to Cloud storage (Beecroft 2022; Martin 2022a; Martin 2022b).\nThe coordination of cyber operations with physical military operations by Russian forces is illustrated in general by the Microsoft report, where both physical and virtual attacks appear to drive at the same objective (Digital Security Unit 2022). Specific examples include the Viasat (a contractor for the Ukrainian military) incident, mentioned above, is a contractor for the Ukrainian military) and coordinated cyber and kinetic attacks against power companies (Petkauskas 2022). In addition, propaganda and information operations overlap with cyber operations, indicated by the cyber-enabled information operations in Figures 1 through 4, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. The cyber dimension has therefore played an important role in the conflict, although it did not achieve the full potential and the inherit limitations still preclude it from having a direct impact on the battlefield (van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk & Ramluckan 2022).\n## Psychological operations, disinformation, and influence campaigns\nInformation warfare in the cognitive domain is a key aspect of any conflict. Within the Rusian Ukraine war, there was a heavy cyber-enabled component to disinformation (including use of a deepfake and media manipulation), as well as some traditional PSYOP techniques. Immediately prior to and in the early days of the Russian invasion, disinformation was disseminated by SMS and social media, including the use of compromised social media accounts. In addition, the media and communication sectors were targeted by cyber operations (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In addition to affecting command and control, targeting such sectors reduced the amount of information that the government could provide to its citizens or to the outside world, in theory giving the Russian narrative more dominance.\nFacebook and Instagram accounts were used to spoof European news sites, publishing disinformation to over 60 websites; upon identifying the operation which began in May, Meta disabled the offending accounts. It was reported that this was the largest disinformation operation since the beginning of the conflict, and it used “an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force” (Gatlan 2022b). It was found that bots spreading disinformation against the U.S. reduced the amount of anti-vaccination content and increased pro-Russian content during the first months of the war; however, this effort did not gain traction (Wait 2022b). Over 300 disinformation sites related to the war were identified, and a number of narratives were shared including; a fighter pilot known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv' shooting down Russian aircraft, a deepfake of President Zelensky calling for surrender, U.S. bioweapons labs in Europe, videos of a President Putin in jail due to a coup, and examples of media manipulation to discredit Ukrainian government officials (Roache et al. 2022). In Hungary, traditional billboards were used to equate the sanctions against Russia to armed attacks and styling them as excessive (Tidey 2022). This is an example that ‘traditional' influence is still present, despite the move to the digital environment.\nCertain themes were again present, particularly accusations of Nazism. However, some claims had been taken too far, prompting President Putin to make an apology (Bella, Hendrix & Ilyushin 2022). However, the symbols painted on Russian military vehicles gained their own status, akin to the Nazi use of the swastika. The various symbols caused much speculation, but one in particular, ‘Z', has become a symbol for the Russian aggression and is seen as a pro-war symbol (Mackintosh 2022). This association has led some organisations to change their logos and some European countries to ban the public display of the symbol, although these moves have also been used to make claims of Russophobia (Tengjun 2022).\nA difference between 2014 and 2022 is that Ukraine had a fledgling government when Crimea was annexed it just having ousted the pro-Russian government; in 2022, the government was more stable and had years of experience dealing with disinformation and the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Zelensky's repeated presentations at national forums calling for assistance and sanctions aided in providing an almost unified front against Russia. The Ukrainian propaganda portraying heroism was particularly successful and the overall influence of the propaganda effort was key to keep the flow of funding and weapons as well as the sanctions in place (Meakin 2022). By contrast, the Russian propaganda effort appeared to be thinly disguised distraction and dismissal to Western audiences, often making false claims against Ukraine or the U.S. (such as that they were using dirty bombs or counter-accusations of war crimes), continuing the 4Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay) seen in previous iterations of the boarder conflict. While there was more international engagement, such as speeches by Minister Lavrov which were met by walkouts (Euronews 2022). However, the walkouts could be presented to the Russian population as evidence of a hostile West, and the speeches could be aimed at the Russian population rather than the immediate audience. The Russian internal-facing propaganda appeared to be somewhat effective, with many Russians not believing there was a war in Ukraine and then later believing that Russia could win (Dixon 2022).\n## Other areas of IW\nThis section focuses on the reports of intelligence and electronic warfare activities during the conflict. A notable aspect was proactive intelligence disclosures by the U.S. predicting the invasion and the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines (Beebe & Lieven 2022; Bertrand & Lillis 2022). The increasingly important role of open-source intelligence that was reinforced by the Russian invasion is highlighted by Wait (2022a), where valuable information could be obtained from the Internet and social media in particular, and collectives of investigative journalists were able to aid in providing attribution.\nFor EW, there were reports that flights from Estonia to Finland had to return due to GPS interference, which had also been detected along the Finland-Russian border (Gatlan 2022a). The Starlink satellite systems provided to Ukraine reportedly experienced jamming; however, it was claimed that this was resolved after a software update (Insinna 2022). Russian media reported that a NATO drone had been jammed over the Black Sea (Carbonaro 2022). While both sides have used EW, indications are that the Russian use has improved since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular its EW units are now learning to counter NATO equipment that has been supplied to Ukraine (Clark 2022; Demarest 2022). The Ukrainian government urged citizens to aid the military by disrupting Russian support units, with communications and EW units being emphasised as a target (Starr 2022); this may be an indication that the Russian EW was having an impact on the\nbattlefield. The EW in the conflict is being used to inform the U.S. military's planning; in addition, Russian EW equipment found abandoned will probably provide useful intelligence (Clark 2022; Demarest 2022).\n## Discussion\nFrom the descriptions above, IW has had an important role to play in the conflicts in Ukraine. While in some aspects there are new activities, others have remained constant or have shown gradual evolution.\nSome of the key differences from 2014 to 2022 include multinational support, both through organisations and official representation, that has aided Ukraine in the 2022 conflict. This extends beyond the financing and weapons delivery, but includes active support in the cyber domain, with foreign intelligence services admitting to conducting operations to bolster the defence of Ukraine's cyberspace. These include the deployment of forward-hunting operations to aid in disabling hostile cyberoperations; however, these will also prove useful in gathering intelligence on Russian cyber capabilities.\nThe use of wiper malware, being more destructive and targeting infrastructure, as well as hack and leak operations are new tactics in the cyber domain, even though the use of DDoS and website defacements were still prevalent. There appeared to be increased targeting of industrial systems, including satellite communications. While there were incidents between the two major stages of armed conflict, these may have been in preparation for a major military incursion into Ukraine. The number of attempts against Ukrainian power utilities, although largely foiled from causing widespread outages, indicates that this may have been part of a strategy to force the Ukrainian population into submission and to hasten a military conquest of the country. It is possible that there was an over-reliance on these aspects, and, when they failed, the troops on the ground met much stiffer resistance than expected.\nThe potential for increased cyber operations resulted in more attention to the environment, and active tracking of reported incidents by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), giving a detailed record of alleged incidents. This has given more insight into the use of cyber operations than during any prior political crisis or conflict. In addition, open calls by the Ukrainian government for a ‘volunteer cyber army' represented the first time a nation has publicly encouraged civilians to engage in hostile cyber activity against another nation on such a scale. This will have contributed to the increased cyber activity, but also raises several questions which, until that point, had been rhetorical: how would civilians engaging in cyber operations against a state during a time of armed conflict be classified, and what measure can be taken against them in order to protect critical systems?\nDisinformation and influence operations played a role from 2014 through 2022. A difference was that the current Ukrainian government had been in place when the conflict started, and had more experience dealing with influence campaigns than the government that had just taken office in 2014. This has shown in the way the Ukrainian government, led by President Zelensky, has engaged with other world leaders to solidify support for its war efforts.\nLeading up to the Russian invasion in 2022, unprecedented proactive intelligence disclosures were made warning of the impending invasion, and subsequently for the attacks on the Nordstream pipelines. However, similar attempts were made by Russia which were received as falsehoods in\nthat the same accusations were levelled against Russia. This may change the nature of intelligence sharing and make intelligence more open source.\nDespite some differences and new techniques and tactics, there are similarities from 2014 to 2022. Hacktivist involvement, website defacement, and DDoS attacks are ever-present factors. Cyber operations were coordinated with physical operations; however, there seems to be an evolution to include new targets and methods as discussed above. In both 2014 and 2022, observers commented that they thought cyber operations would play a larger role than what materialised; however, the number of cyber incidents has grown significantly. The prevailing theory, which is supported by evidence, is that cyber operations are more suitable for use outside of open armed conflict, and that what did occur in 2022 had limited military tactical benefit, as indicated by van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk, and Ramluckan (2022). The opposing view was that the heightened preparedness and international support blunted the impact of the initial aggressive cyber operations.\nIn the cognitive domain, similar narratives for disinformation and influence operations were prevalent, and similar tactics remained from 2014 through 2022. On the intelligence front, the role of open source intelligence, fuelled in part by social media remained; however, this is evolving to become more prevalent, as posited by van Niekerk (2015).\n## Conclusion\nInformation warfare has played a significant part in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, since the Maidan uprisings overthrowing the pro-Russian Ukrainian government, through the annexation of Crimea, the separatist movements in the East, up to and including the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict. This history provides a particularly useful case study to investigate how IW has evolved (and remained the same) over the eight-year period.\nSome new tactics, particularly in the cyber domain—such as wipers and infrastructure attacks—emerged in 2022 compared to 2014; however, between 2015 and 2017, these appeared to have been tested. International support aided in the Ukrainian war effort, including forward-hunting teams for cyber defence and proactive intelligence disclosures. Electronic warfare use appeared to remain constant throughout. Disinformation and influence operations also remained constant, as did some of the major narratives; however, in 2022, this was a more contested space, compared to 2014.\nWhile the future remains uncertain, cyber operations may not play a major role on the battlefield for the foreseeable future; however, the quantity and intensity of cyber operations due to conflict and particularly immediately preceding conflict may continue to grow, as is evidenced from what happened between 2014 and 2022. Similarly, disinformation and influence operations are likely to intensify with some evolution. Intelligence may show the largest evolution going forward, with more open releases and greater use of open sources, given the pervasive connectivity of devices and information posted on social media.",
  "flat_text": "# The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nB van Niekerk\nDepartment of Information Technology\nDurban University of Technology\nDurban, South Africa\nEmail: brettv@dut.ac.za\nAbstract: In January 2022, Russian forces began building up on the Ukrainian border prior to entering Ukraine in what was termed a 'special military operation' in support of ethnic Russians. In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.\nKeywords: Cyber operations, Disinformation, Information Warfare, Intelligence Disclosures, Volunteer Cyber Army\n# Introduction\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered into Ukrainian sovereign territory in what was termed a 'special military operation'. This had followed weeks of the forces building up along the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus, which were claimed to be exercises with denials on any impending military action against Ukraine. The broader conflict began in 2014 after anti-government protests from late 2013 successfully ousted the pro-Russian government in Kyiv. The Russian annexation of Crimea occurred shortly thereafter, followed by a low-intensity conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Alongside these activities in the physical domain, the conflict was also occurring in the information domain.\nThere is no consistent approach to the concept of information warfare (IW), which has also undergone evolution over the last two decades. For the purposes of this article, IW is considered to be an encompassing concept of activities in the physical, logical, and cognitive domains that seek to impact or protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (van Niekerk 2015). Information warfare can be considered to be comprised of:\n- Cyber operations\n- Influence operations, disinformation, propaganda, and psychological operations\n- Electronic warfare\n- Intelligence\nJournal of Information Warfare (2023) 22.1: 10-31\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nThe article considers openly available reports of IW activity during the conflict in Ukraine to illustrate the evolution of tactics from 2014 up to and including 2022. The next section provides an overview of key IW activity in the 2014 crisis and annexation of Crimea. This is followed by the relevant activity between the main events of 2014 and 2022. The next section covers the IW activity during the 2022 conflict. Thereafter, a discussion to highlight the key evolutions of IW is conducted, and the article is then concluded.\n# Information Warfare in the 2014 Protests and the Annexation of Crimea\nThe use of IW in the 2014 Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea were discussed in-depth previously by the author (van Niekerk 2015). This section will provide a summary of key points from that chapter, which provides as a baseline against which the IW activities in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict can be benchmarked. The crisis in Ukraine began at the end of 2013 with protests against the pro-Russian government, during which social media played a role. In 2014, as the protests continued, security forces became violent, resulting in the protests intensifying and the situation escalating. Eventually the Ukrainian president fled to Russia, and a new government was installed by 23 February 2014. However, pro-Russian protests began, and social media was used to divide ethnic Russians by spreading fear, which the new government did not address. A week later, armed militia began seizing key points in Crimea, and, in early March, a video emerged of Russian-made military equipment entering Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied the forces were theirs, but by 16 March a referendum had been held, claiming that the majority of Crimeans wished to join Russia, completing the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Subsequently, pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine began seizing buildings and a period of low-intensity conflict began, during which the downing of MH17 occurred. The diplomatic response to these actions was the implementation and increasing sanctions on Russia, and Russia putting pressure on Ukraine to pay for gas supplies.\nThe protests in Ukraine were a useful case study, as they could be benchmarked against the Orange Revolution of 2004, prior to extensive use of social media in popular uprisings. This comparison illustrated that social media gave anti-government protestors and journalists a platform for mass-dissemination of information outside of the state-controlled traditional media, and that the protestors found this information more reliable than formal news platforms . During the incursion in Crimea, Russian media made numerous claims which indicated chaos and mass defections in Ukraine, many of which were shown to be inaccurate; in addition, images began showing that the forces in Crimea were in fact Russian, as images of the same individuals were shown from the Russian incursion into Georgia in 2008 (van Niekerk 2015). A key perspective was provided by Kates and Butorin (2014), who indicated that the Russian media was providing a reality to their target audience, namely the Russian population, in order to maintain support, and this did not necessarily align with reality. This was generally successful as a majority of the Russian population trusted the Russian media, and the persistent rhetoric dominated over other sources provided an 'alternate' truth (Kates &amp; Butorin 2014). The use of pro-Russian 'trolls' to discredit social media and blog posters was reported, indicating attempts to dominate the narrative on social media and online (chornajuravka 2014).\nCyber operations were present prior to and during the annexation of Crimea, in particular cyber-espionage, distributed denial of service attacks, and website defacements. Cyber-espionage campaigns were present well before the crisis in 2013/2014, with a number of campaigns targeting Ukraine and other nations within the Russian sphere of influence and with another cyber-espionage\nJournal of Information Warfare\ncampaign predominantly targeting Ukraine in 2013 and 2014 (van Niekerk 2015). One particular cyber-espionage campaign of 2013 bears specific mention in that the lure was fake Ukrainian foreign policy documents purporting to show Ukraine's plans to seek NATO membership . As the narratives giving rise to the tensions in 2014, and as discussed later in 2022, this theme becomes core. Webpage defacements had begun in early November 2013, pre-dating the protests; however, the themes are worth recognition in the context of this article: the defacement of Ukrainian government websites and the distribution of false emails both contained a message claiming to be from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence . During the initial stages of armed incursion in Crimea, webpage defacements targeting the Russian government and organisations routinely used the term ‘Nazi” (van Niekerk 2015).\nThe most common cyber incident was DDoS attacks. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was targeted in retaliation for the alleged hacks mentioned above . A notable tactic was the use of DDoS attacks in conjunction with physical attacks against the communication infrastructure during the early stages of the armed incursion into Crimea, which disrupted the Ukrainian forces' based in Crimea ability to communicate; in addition, mobile phones of the Ukrainian parliament were disrupted . This tactic was seen previously in the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The DDoS attacks also became prevalent prior to the scheduled Crimean referendum to join Russia—although the majority of DDoS incidents were claimed by hacktivist groups (van Niekerk 2015). Commentary on the cyber incidents surrounding the Ukrainian political crisis and the annexation of Crimea indicated surprise about the limited and constrained use of cyber operations by Russia, with suggestions that the Ukrainian hackers were more skilled and could mount stronger retaliations .\nIn May 2014, there was an attempt to disrupt and interfere with the Ukrainian 2014 presidential election. Clayton (2014b) indicates attempts were made to delete data, leak information, alter the voting totals (with the use of malware), and then disrupt access with a DDoS attack. The attack was attributed to a pro-Russian hacktivist group; however, this has been refuted (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). A disinformation operation was coordinated with the attempt to alter voting data, as a Russian news channel incorrectly reported a win of the pro-Russian candidate with the same voting percentages that the above-mentioned malware attempted to insert into the voting platform. This implies a concerted effort to use cyber operations and disinformation to ‘hijack' the election in a way that aligned with the Russian propaganda narrative .\nThe use of electronic warfare appeared limited, with only a single report, which claimed that Russian satellite television had been jammed . From an intelligence perspective, social media proved to be useful for open source intelligence; where videos of troop movements appeared, selfies aided in identifying possible Russian troops and aided in attribution for the downing of flight MH17 (van Niekerk 2015).\nIn summary, the IW activities in 2014 began exhibiting boarder coordination amongst cyber operations, the propaganda effort, and physical operations on the ground. The IW operations did not stop, but a few notable incidents occurred between the major events of 2014 and 2022, which will be covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the ‘Inter-War' Period\nBetween the main events of 2014, as described above, and the direct military conflict in 2022\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(discussed in the next section), a number of information warfare activities occurred that were notable. Of key interest are a series of cyber operations which demonstrated the potential for significant impact and disruption through cyber means, and some foreshadowed other similar events that occurred subsequently.\nIn December of both 2015 and 2016, malware impacted parts of the Ukrainian electricity grid, resulting in a loss of power to the areas serviced by the affected substations. In 2015, 16 substations were affected, disrupting the electricity supply for up to six hours for over 200,000 customers. This malware was attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Sandworm (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In 2016 another APT, known as Electrum with reported links to the Sandworm APT, caused a shorter disruption, which affected about a fifth of Kyiv's supply. However, the functionality of the malware indicated the potential for causing broader cascading effects across the power grid (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Dragos 2017). In October 2016 it was reported that a Ukrainian hacktivist group had conducted a 'hack and leak' operation against a senior Russian official's emails, which provided evidence that Russia was involved in the 2014 separatist movements .\nIn June 2017, a modified version of the Petya ransomware appeared to target Ukrainian organisations, but then rapidly spread globally in what is the most expensive cyber incident recorded. The malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability, used by the WannaCry ransomware worm the month before, but it was also modified so the encryption was irreversible, resulting in it being renamed NotPetya and reclassified as a wiper. While NotPetya was known for its global financial impact that exceeded 10 billion USD and disrupted shipping company Maersk, it impacted a number of Ukrainian organisations, including radiation monitoring at Chernobyl (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Greenberg 2018). In 2018, a water filtration plant experienced a cyber operation attributed to Russia, which was reportedly fended off. The operation employed the VPNFilter malware that targeted networking devices . Slowik (2018) indicates that the technical details are scarce, and the fact that the malware originally could only intercept traffic and not modify it indicates that this may have been intelligence gathering to prepare for a cyber operation against the plant, rather than being able to affect the integrity of the industrial systems in any way.\nUkraine has been described as a 'testing ground' for cyber operations: in addition to the widely reported Russian cyber operations, there are a multitude of cyber-espionage operations reported in Eastern Ukraine ostensibly collecting intelligence on the situation there . The cyber operations described above exhibit a worrying trend, in that industrial controls systems could be targeted and could cause disruption to critical infrastructure; also of concern is the scale of the 'collateral damage' that NotPetya caused. Such cyber operations are clearly strategic and are intended to target civilian infrastructure, possibly to erode daily functioning of a country as well as the psychological resilience of the population. In this sense, cyber operations are being used, or at least attempted to being used, in a manner similar to strategic bombers of World War II, albeit with more precision and less physical destruction.\nPropaganda was a continuous feature surrounding the separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine, where the narratives echoed that of Russian and former Soviet propaganda, with some echoes of World War II. These narratives also indicate a type of extremist viewpoint, where the separatists portray themselves as heroically protecting their values, but are victims of overwhelming hostile adversaries: primarily Ukraine, supported by the majority of the world (Kostyuchenko &amp; Pushkar\nJournal of Information Warfare\n2022). During the COVID pandemic, the separatist groups spread conspiracy theories to erode confidence in the government measures and also suggested that the U.S. biolabs created the virus . Doroshenko and Lukito (2021) illustrate that pro-Russian influence operations related to Ukraine are an evolution of the Cold War concept of reflexive control for the digital world. These operations engage with the audience in such a way that their decision making is favourable to the objectives of the perpetrator. In an attempt to counter influence operations and propaganda for war in the context of Ukraine, Richter (2015) contends that countries utilised their own local laws, whereas a set of international norms might have proven to be more effective. While little is reported of EW use during this period, Russian EW units have reportedly supported the separatists by distributing propaganda over cellular phone networks in addition to disrupting and detecting (for targeting purposes) Ukrainian communications .\nWhile IW operations were not as intense in terms of the amount outside of major military operations (or less attention was being paid to the IW activities), they were still present. During this period some of the most notable cyber operations were conducted, namely NotPetya and the attacks against the electric grid, taking a step closer to what could potentially produce a blackout across major portions of a country. These operations appeared to be preparation for what was to come in 2022, which is covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Conflict\nDue to the amount of information available about the IW efforts in the 2022 conflict, this section will be divided to focus on specific areas; however, there may still be overlaps (for example cyber-enabled influence operations). Cyber operations are discussed first, followed by influence operations, and then a section on other notable IW activities during the conflict.\n## Cyber operations\nThe number of recorded cyber operations for the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict is notable; it is possible that there was more activity, but at the same time there was more attention to cyber operations during the conflict. The CyberPeace Institute (2022b) has an interactive portal dedicated to tracking cyber incidents during the conflict, and recorded 626 alleged incidents in 2022 related to the Ukraine conflict; this averages to nearly two incidents per day.\nIn January there were some wiper attacks, website defacements of government websites, and attempts to compromise government organisations. In February, incidents of cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, and disinformation were reported. Immediately preceding the invasion (23 February), more DDoS attacks, wipers, and ransomware were reported. During the initial stages of the Russian incursion into Ukraine (24-25 February), DDoS, wipers, phishing, social media-based disinformation, and website compromises were seen; the DDoS attacks and disinformation continued to late February, and in early March cyber operations targeted the media and communications sector, and malware targeted non-government organisations (CyberPeace Institute 2022b).\nFigure 1 illustrates the composition of the 626 cyber-operations recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), categorised into 10 incident types from January to October. As is evident from the figure, the majority of the incidents were DDoS, followed by hack and leak operations. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalent categories of 201 cyber incidents that targeted Ukraine; the 158 incidents that targeted Russia are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 illustrates the categories of 267 incidents\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nrelated to the conflict that targeted nations or organisations globally. DDoS attacks were the most prevalent type, targeting Ukraine and global targets, while hack and leak operations were the most prevalent against Russia.\nFigure 1: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 2: Types of cyber operations targeting Ukraine, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 3: Types of cyber operations targeting Russia, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 4: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict targeting the rest of the world, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of cyber incidents per month. Those targeting Ukraine began in January, increased in February, with an initial peak in March. Many of these may have been preparatory in nature, as with previous conflicts, to disrupt communication and disseminate disinformation in an attempt to dominate the information sphere during the early stages of the conflict. Those targeting Russia began in February, with an increase in March, and initial peak in April. These lagged the incidents against Ukraine by a month, and were probably retaliatory in nature. The incidents with global impact began in January, with a slight increase in February, peaking in April. However, the decline was slower than that of Russia and Ukraine. All areas experienced second peaks from August to October.\nFigure 5: Number of cyber operations targeting the belligerents (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 6 illustrates the number of incidents for each category per month. Due to the number of DDoS incidents, these are shown on a separate graph. The DDoS attacks peaked drastically in August and September, to an extent that they overshadowed some of the other categories. In January, wipers and defacement were most prevalent, with cyber espionage and wipers being the most prevalent in March and April. This speaks to how cyber operations are used by Russia. The use of volunteers for Ukraine is discussed in more detail later. A report by Microsoft concurred that most destructive attacks (for example, wipers) occurred in the first week of the conflict, and  $40\\%$  of the destructive attacks targeted critical infrastructure (Digital Security Unit 2022).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\n(b) DDoS and total\nFigure 6: Types of cyber operations per month (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFrom Figure 7, it is evident that hacking collectives are by far the most prevalent threat actor type, followed by nation-state actors. This further demonstrates the role of non-state actors in the cyber domain during the conflict. Of the 65 unique threat actors identified by the CyberPeace Institute, 38 were supporting Russia and 27 were supporting Ukraine. Two interesting threat actors supporting Russia originated from Brazil and Iraq (CyberPeace Institute 2022), which falls outside of the usual online belligerents related to the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The weighting towards the\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\ncollectives is not necessarily unusual; however, Ukraine did follow a strategy of openly calling for international cyber volunteers to support its cyber operations (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022). This, however, raises concerns that, while such volunteers and hacktivists are often seen during times of heightened political tension, their presence when there is an actual physical conflict could unintentionally involve countries that are essentially neutral, or the cyber volunteers could potentially be classified as mercenaries or combatants and open themselves (and the country they reside in) to retaliation. In addition to the volunteers, cybercriminal groups openly chose sides . However, a ransomware gang that declared its support for Russia experienced leaks of information, thought to be Ukrainian members of the group retaliating; these leaks provided useful insights into the operations of ransomware groups .\nFigure 7: Types of threat actors (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 8 illustrates the types of cyber operations that each threat actor type was conducting. The collectives overwhelmingly favoured DDoS and hack and leak operations; nation state actors accounted for more cyber espionage, 'other' incidents, and wipers. Given the timing of the hack and leak operations shown in Figure 6(a), and the prevalence of hack and leak operations against Russia (Figure 3) and that they were committed by collectives, it can be deduced that these may have been volunteers targeting Russia in retaliation for the invasion and the for the support of cyber operations. Similarly, globally there were a number of DDoS attacks from August to October (Figure 6[a]), also conducted by collectives. These largely affected global targets, but also Ukraine and Russia. Some of these DDoS attacks could have grown out of frustration by pro-Russian groups of the waning support to Russia; for example, multiple websites of the Bulgarian Government were targeted for what the perpetrator claimed was the Bulgarian betrayal of Russia . A situation may have arisen where various hacking collectives began targeting countries as a series of reprisals; van Niekerk and Maharaj (2011) predicted this as a likely occurrence in a cyber conflict, based on a series of retaliatory cyber incidents in support of either Wikileaks or the U.S. government in 2010.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(b) DDoS and Total\nFigure 8: Types of incident per threat actor type (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nSome notable incidents include a cyber operation against a broadband satellite provider, Viasat, on 24 February . This illustrates a continuation of the practice of targeting media and communication platforms alongside the initial military operations. In addition to significant damage to the terminals at Viasat, the 'collateral damage' of the incident affected parts of Europe, including remote access to over 5000 wind turbines in Germany . A border control station between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly affected by a wiper malware on 25 February, slowing down the processing of Ukrainian refugees . A number of cyber operations against industrial systems were reported: Belarusian hacktivist collectives claimed that they targeted railway systems to hinder Russian troop movements (Gallagher &amp; Bloomberg 2022); cyber operations (which ultimately failed) targeting power companies that included wiper malware as well as an updated version of the malware used to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 were found, (ESET Research 2022; Goodchild 2022). In addition, a Russian taxi operator was compromised and all taxis were instructed to go to the same location in Moscow, causing a traffic jam . These attacks are outside of the usual website defacements and DDoS attacks that have traditionally been exhibited during times of conflict.\nObservers commented on the lack of visible cyber operations by Russia after the early stages of the conflict, as it was expected by some to have been much greater by several researchers (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022; Schneider 2022). By comparison, Russia appeared a much greater cyber power in relation to Ukraine: the National Cyber Power Index 2020 listed Russia as  $4^{\\text{th}}$  and Ukraine as  $26^{\\text{th}}$  of 30 countries ; therefore, a strong presence by Russia in the cyber arena would have made sense. Proposed reasons for the quieter than expected cyber domain are that, in a physical conflict, kinetic weapons are more useful and cyber operations are more suited for deception and deniability, making them ideal for use outside of open conflict (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022). Urchill (2022) indicates that the attempts against the Ukrainian power grid indicate that cyber operations were active, which negates the growing narrative that they were quiet. The number of cyber incidents recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b) and illustrated by the figures above indicate that there was a significant amount\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof activity. While there were attacks on critical infrastructure, they did not succeed due to (at least in part) assistance that Ukraine received . In addition to the volunteers supporting Ukraine mentioned above, there was formal foreign assistance, including ‘hunt forward' operations by the U.S. Cyber Command . The scope of the foreign assistance included forward deployments and remote assistance for cyber defence by both vendors and official personnel, the sharing of threat intelligence, and services provided to improve the resilience of Ukrainian systems, such as migrating to Cloud storage .\nThe coordination of cyber operations with physical military operations by Russian forces is illustrated in general by the Microsoft report, where both physical and virtual attacks appear to drive at the same objective (Digital Security Unit 2022). Specific examples include the Viasat (a contractor for the Ukrainian military) incident, mentioned above, is a contractor for the Ukrainian military) and coordinated cyber and kinetic attacks against power companies . In addition, propaganda and information operations overlap with cyber operations, indicated by the cyber-enabled information operations in Figures 1 through 4, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. The cyber dimension has therefore played an important role in the conflict, although it did not achieve the full potential and the inherit limitations still preclude it from having a direct impact on the battlefield (van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk & Ramluckan 2022).\n## Psychological operations, disinformation, and influence campaigns\nInformation warfare in the cognitive domain is a key aspect of any conflict. Within the Rusian Ukraine war, there was a heavy cyber-enabled component to disinformation (including use of a deepfake and media manipulation), as well as some traditional PSYOP techniques. Immediately prior to and in the early days of the Russian invasion, disinformation was disseminated by SMS and social media, including the use of compromised social media accounts. In addition, the media and communication sectors were targeted by cyber operations (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In addition to affecting command and control, targeting such sectors reduced the amount of information that the government could provide to its citizens or to the outside world, in theory giving the Russian narrative more dominance.\nFacebook and Instagram accounts were used to spoof European news sites, publishing disinformation to over 60 websites; upon identifying the operation which began in May, Meta disabled the offending accounts. It was reported that this was the largest disinformation operation since the beginning of the conflict, and it used “an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force” . It was found that bots spreading disinformation against the U.S. reduced the amount of anti-vaccination content and increased pro-Russian content during the first months of the war; however, this effort did not gain traction . Over 300 disinformation sites related to the war were identified, and a number of narratives were shared including; a fighter pilot known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv' shooting down Russian aircraft, a deepfake of President Zelensky calling for surrender, U.S. bioweapons labs in Europe, videos of a President Putin in jail due to a coup, and examples of media manipulation to discredit Ukrainian government officials . In Hungary, traditional billboards were used to equate the sanctions against Russia to armed attacks and styling them as excessive . This is an example that ‘traditional' influence is still present, despite the move to the digital environment.\nCertain themes were again present, particularly accusations of Nazism. However, some claims had been taken too far, prompting President Putin to make an apology (Bella, Hendrix & Ilyushin 2022). However, the symbols painted on Russian military vehicles gained their own status, akin to the Nazi use of the swastika. The various symbols caused much speculation, but one in particular, ‘Z', has become a symbol for the Russian aggression and is seen as a pro-war symbol . This association has led some organisations to change their logos and some European countries to ban the public display of the symbol, although these moves have also been used to make claims of Russophobia .\nA difference between 2014 and 2022 is that Ukraine had a fledgling government when Crimea was annexed it just having ousted the pro-Russian government; in 2022, the government was more stable and had years of experience dealing with disinformation and the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Zelensky's repeated presentations at national forums calling for assistance and sanctions aided in providing an almost unified front against Russia. The Ukrainian propaganda portraying heroism was particularly successful and the overall influence of the propaganda effort was key to keep the flow of funding and weapons as well as the sanctions in place . By contrast, the Russian propaganda effort appeared to be thinly disguised distraction and dismissal to Western audiences, often making false claims against Ukraine or the U.S. (such as that they were using dirty bombs or counter-accusations of war crimes), continuing the 4Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay) seen in previous iterations of the boarder conflict. While there was more international engagement, such as speeches by Minister Lavrov which were met by walkouts . However, the walkouts could be presented to the Russian population as evidence of a hostile West, and the speeches could be aimed at the Russian population rather than the immediate audience. The Russian internal-facing propaganda appeared to be somewhat effective, with many Russians not believing there was a war in Ukraine and then later believing that Russia could win .\n## Other areas of IW\nThis section focuses on the reports of intelligence and electronic warfare activities during the conflict. A notable aspect was proactive intelligence disclosures by the U.S. predicting the invasion and the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines . The increasingly important role of open-source intelligence that was reinforced by the Russian invasion is highlighted by Wait (2022a), where valuable information could be obtained from the Internet and social media in particular, and collectives of investigative journalists were able to aid in providing attribution.\nFor EW, there were reports that flights from Estonia to Finland had to return due to GPS interference, which had also been detected along the Finland-Russian border . The Starlink satellite systems provided to Ukraine reportedly experienced jamming; however, it was claimed that this was resolved after a software update . Russian media reported that a NATO drone had been jammed over the Black Sea . While both sides have used EW, indications are that the Russian use has improved since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular its EW units are now learning to counter NATO equipment that has been supplied to Ukraine . The Ukrainian government urged citizens to aid the military by disrupting Russian support units, with communications and EW units being emphasised as a target ; this may be an indication that the Russian EW was having an impact on the\nbattlefield. The EW in the conflict is being used to inform the U.S. military's planning; in addition, Russian EW equipment found abandoned will probably provide useful intelligence .\n## Discussion\nFrom the descriptions above, IW has had an important role to play in the conflicts in Ukraine. While in some aspects there are new activities, others have remained constant or have shown gradual evolution.\nSome of the key differences from 2014 to 2022 include multinational support, both through organisations and official representation, that has aided Ukraine in the 2022 conflict. This extends beyond the financing and weapons delivery, but includes active support in the cyber domain, with foreign intelligence services admitting to conducting operations to bolster the defence of Ukraine's cyberspace. These include the deployment of forward-hunting operations to aid in disabling hostile cyberoperations; however, these will also prove useful in gathering intelligence on Russian cyber capabilities.\nThe use of wiper malware, being more destructive and targeting infrastructure, as well as hack and leak operations are new tactics in the cyber domain, even though the use of DDoS and website defacements were still prevalent. There appeared to be increased targeting of industrial systems, including satellite communications. While there were incidents between the two major stages of armed conflict, these may have been in preparation for a major military incursion into Ukraine. The number of attempts against Ukrainian power utilities, although largely foiled from causing widespread outages, indicates that this may have been part of a strategy to force the Ukrainian population into submission and to hasten a military conquest of the country. It is possible that there was an over-reliance on these aspects, and, when they failed, the troops on the ground met much stiffer resistance than expected.\nThe potential for increased cyber operations resulted in more attention to the environment, and active tracking of reported incidents by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), giving a detailed record of alleged incidents. This has given more insight into the use of cyber operations than during any prior political crisis or conflict. In addition, open calls by the Ukrainian government for a ‘volunteer cyber army' represented the first time a nation has publicly encouraged civilians to engage in hostile cyber activity against another nation on such a scale. This will have contributed to the increased cyber activity, but also raises several questions which, until that point, had been rhetorical: how would civilians engaging in cyber operations against a state during a time of armed conflict be classified, and what measure can be taken against them in order to protect critical systems?\nDisinformation and influence operations played a role from 2014 through 2022. A difference was that the current Ukrainian government had been in place when the conflict started, and had more experience dealing with influence campaigns than the government that had just taken office in 2014. This has shown in the way the Ukrainian government, led by President Zelensky, has engaged with other world leaders to solidify support for its war efforts.\nLeading up to the Russian invasion in 2022, unprecedented proactive intelligence disclosures were made warning of the impending invasion, and subsequently for the attacks on the Nordstream pipelines. However, similar attempts were made by Russia which were received as falsehoods in\nthat the same accusations were levelled against Russia. This may change the nature of intelligence sharing and make intelligence more open source.\nDespite some differences and new techniques and tactics, there are similarities from 2014 to 2022. Hacktivist involvement, website defacement, and DDoS attacks are ever-present factors. Cyber operations were coordinated with physical operations; however, there seems to be an evolution to include new targets and methods as discussed above. In both 2014 and 2022, observers commented that they thought cyber operations would play a larger role than what materialised; however, the number of cyber incidents has grown significantly. The prevailing theory, which is supported by evidence, is that cyber operations are more suitable for use outside of open armed conflict, and that what did occur in 2022 had limited military tactical benefit, as indicated by van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk, and Ramluckan (2022). The opposing view was that the heightened preparedness and international support blunted the impact of the initial aggressive cyber operations.\nIn the cognitive domain, similar narratives for disinformation and influence operations were prevalent, and similar tactics remained from 2014 through 2022. On the intelligence front, the role of open source intelligence, fuelled in part by social media remained; however, this is evolving to become more prevalent, as posited by van Niekerk (2015).\n## Conclusion\nInformation warfare has played a significant part in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, since the Maidan uprisings overthrowing the pro-Russian Ukrainian government, through the annexation of Crimea, the separatist movements in the East, up to and including the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict. This history provides a particularly useful case study to investigate how IW has evolved (and remained the same) over the eight-year period.\nSome new tactics, particularly in the cyber domain—such as wipers and infrastructure attacks—emerged in 2022 compared to 2014; however, between 2015 and 2017, these appeared to have been tested. International support aided in the Ukrainian war effort, including forward-hunting teams for cyber defence and proactive intelligence disclosures. Electronic warfare use appeared to remain constant throughout. Disinformation and influence operations also remained constant, as did some of the major narratives; however, in 2022, this was a more contested space, compared to 2014.\nWhile the future remains uncertain, cyber operations may not play a major role on the battlefield for the foreseeable future; however, the quantity and intensity of cyber operations due to conflict and particularly immediately preceding conflict may continue to grow, as is evidenced from what happened between 2014 and 2022. Similarly, disinformation and influence operations are likely to intensify with some evolution. Intelligence may show the largest evolution going forward, with more open releases and greater use of open sources, given the pervasive connectivity of devices and information posted on social media.",

    "__preamble__": "# The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nB van Niekerk\nDepartment of Information Technology\nDurban University of Technology\nDurban, South Africa\nEmail: brettv@dut.ac.za\nAbstract: In January 2022, Russian forces began building up on the Ukrainian border prior to entering Ukraine in what was termed a 'special military operation' in support of ethnic Russians. In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.\nKeywords: Cyber operations, Disinformation, Information Warfare, Intelligence Disclosures, Volunteer Cyber Army",
    "# Introduction": "On 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered into Ukrainian sovereign territory in what was termed a 'special military operation'. This had followed weeks of the forces building up along the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus, which were claimed to be exercises with denials on any impending military action against Ukraine. The broader conflict began in 2014 after anti-government protests from late 2013 successfully ousted the pro-Russian government in Kyiv. The Russian annexation of Crimea occurred shortly thereafter, followed by a low-intensity conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Alongside these activities in the physical domain, the conflict was also occurring in the information domain.\nThere is no consistent approach to the concept of information warfare (IW), which has also undergone evolution over the last two decades. For the purposes of this article, IW is considered to be an encompassing concept of activities in the physical, logical, and cognitive domains that seek to impact or protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (van Niekerk 2015). Information warfare can be considered to be comprised of:\n- Cyber operations\n- Influence operations, disinformation, propaganda, and psychological operations\n- Electronic warfare\n- Intelligence\nJournal of Information Warfare (2023) 22.1: 10-31\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nThe article considers openly available reports of IW activity during the conflict in Ukraine to illustrate the evolution of tactics from 2014 up to and including 2022. The next section provides an overview of key IW activity in the 2014 crisis and annexation of Crimea. This is followed by the relevant activity between the main events of 2014 and 2022. The next section covers the IW activity during the 2022 conflict. Thereafter, a discussion to highlight the key evolutions of IW is conducted, and the article is then concluded.",
    "## Information Warfare in the ‘Inter-War' Period": "Between the main events of 2014, as described above, and the direct military conflict in 2022\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(discussed in the next section), a number of information warfare activities occurred that were notable. Of key interest are a series of cyber operations which demonstrated the potential for significant impact and disruption through cyber means, and some foreshadowed other similar events that occurred subsequently.\nIn December of both 2015 and 2016, malware impacted parts of the Ukrainian electricity grid, resulting in a loss of power to the areas serviced by the affected substations. In 2015, 16 substations were affected, disrupting the electricity supply for up to six hours for over 200,000 customers. This malware was attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Sandworm (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In 2016 another APT, known as Electrum with reported links to the Sandworm APT, caused a shorter disruption, which affected about a fifth of Kyiv's supply. However, the functionality of the malware indicated the potential for causing broader cascading effects across the power grid (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Dragos 2017). In October 2016 it was reported that a Ukrainian hacktivist group had conducted a 'hack and leak' operation against a senior Russian official's emails, which provided evidence that Russia was involved in the 2014 separatist movements .\nIn June 2017, a modified version of the Petya ransomware appeared to target Ukrainian organisations, but then rapidly spread globally in what is the most expensive cyber incident recorded. The malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability, used by the WannaCry ransomware worm the month before, but it was also modified so the encryption was irreversible, resulting in it being renamed NotPetya and reclassified as a wiper. While NotPetya was known for its global financial impact that exceeded 10 billion USD and disrupted shipping company Maersk, it impacted a number of Ukrainian organisations, including radiation monitoring at Chernobyl (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Greenberg 2018). In 2018, a water filtration plant experienced a cyber operation attributed to Russia, which was reportedly fended off. The operation employed the VPNFilter malware that targeted networking devices . Slowik (2018) indicates that the technical details are scarce, and the fact that the malware originally could only intercept traffic and not modify it indicates that this may have been intelligence gathering to prepare for a cyber operation against the plant, rather than being able to affect the integrity of the industrial systems in any way.\nUkraine has been described as a 'testing ground' for cyber operations: in addition to the widely reported Russian cyber operations, there are a multitude of cyber-espionage operations reported in Eastern Ukraine ostensibly collecting intelligence on the situation there . The cyber operations described above exhibit a worrying trend, in that industrial controls systems could be targeted and could cause disruption to critical infrastructure; also of concern is the scale of the 'collateral damage' that NotPetya caused. Such cyber operations are clearly strategic and are intended to target civilian infrastructure, possibly to erode daily functioning of a country as well as the psychological resilience of the population. In this sense, cyber operations are being used, or at least attempted to being used, in a manner similar to strategic bombers of World War II, albeit with more precision and less physical destruction.\nPropaganda was a continuous feature surrounding the separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine, where the narratives echoed that of Russian and former Soviet propaganda, with some echoes of World War II. These narratives also indicate a type of extremist viewpoint, where the separatists portray themselves as heroically protecting their values, but are victims of overwhelming hostile adversaries: primarily Ukraine, supported by the majority of the world (Kostyuchenko &amp; Pushkar\nJournal of Information Warfare\n2022). During the COVID pandemic, the separatist groups spread conspiracy theories to erode confidence in the government measures and also suggested that the U.S. biolabs created the virus . Doroshenko and Lukito (2021) illustrate that pro-Russian influence operations related to Ukraine are an evolution of the Cold War concept of reflexive control for the digital world. These operations engage with the audience in such a way that their decision making is favourable to the objectives of the perpetrator. In an attempt to counter influence operations and propaganda for war in the context of Ukraine, Richter (2015) contends that countries utilised their own local laws, whereas a set of international norms might have proven to be more effective. While little is reported of EW use during this period, Russian EW units have reportedly supported the separatists by distributing propaganda over cellular phone networks in addition to disrupting and detecting (for targeting purposes) Ukrainian communications .\nWhile IW operations were not as intense in terms of the amount outside of major military operations (or less attention was being paid to the IW activities), they were still present. During this period some of the most notable cyber operations were conducted, namely NotPetya and the attacks against the electric grid, taking a step closer to what could potentially produce a blackout across major portions of a country. These operations appeared to be preparation for what was to come in 2022, which is covered in the next section.",
    "## Information Warfare in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Conflict": "Due to the amount of information available about the IW efforts in the 2022 conflict, this section will be divided to focus on specific areas; however, there may still be overlaps (for example cyber-enabled influence operations). Cyber operations are discussed first, followed by influence operations, and then a section on other notable IW activities during the conflict.",
    "## Cyber operations": "The number of recorded cyber operations for the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict is notable; it is possible that there was more activity, but at the same time there was more attention to cyber operations during the conflict. The CyberPeace Institute (2022b) has an interactive portal dedicated to tracking cyber incidents during the conflict, and recorded 626 alleged incidents in 2022 related to the Ukraine conflict; this averages to nearly two incidents per day.\nIn January there were some wiper attacks, website defacements of government websites, and attempts to compromise government organisations. In February, incidents of cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, and disinformation were reported. Immediately preceding the invasion (23 February), more DDoS attacks, wipers, and ransomware were reported. During the initial stages of the Russian incursion into Ukraine (24-25 February), DDoS, wipers, phishing, social media-based disinformation, and website compromises were seen; the DDoS attacks and disinformation continued to late February, and in early March cyber operations targeted the media and communications sector, and malware targeted non-government organisations (CyberPeace Institute 2022b).\nFigure 1 illustrates the composition of the 626 cyber-operations recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), categorised into 10 incident types from January to October. As is evident from the figure, the majority of the incidents were DDoS, followed by hack and leak operations. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalent categories of 201 cyber incidents that targeted Ukraine; the 158 incidents that targeted Russia are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 illustrates the categories of 267 incidents\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nrelated to the conflict that targeted nations or organisations globally. DDoS attacks were the most prevalent type, targeting Ukraine and global targets, while hack and leak operations were the most prevalent against Russia.\nFigure 1: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 2: Types of cyber operations targeting Ukraine, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 3: Types of cyber operations targeting Russia, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 4: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict targeting the rest of the world, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of cyber incidents per month. Those targeting Ukraine began in January, increased in February, with an initial peak in March. Many of these may have been preparatory in nature, as with previous conflicts, to disrupt communication and disseminate disinformation in an attempt to dominate the information sphere during the early stages of the conflict. Those targeting Russia began in February, with an increase in March, and initial peak in April. These lagged the incidents against Ukraine by a month, and were probably retaliatory in nature. The incidents with global impact began in January, with a slight increase in February, peaking in April. However, the decline was slower than that of Russia and Ukraine. All areas experienced second peaks from August to October.\nFigure 5: Number of cyber operations targeting the belligerents (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 6 illustrates the number of incidents for each category per month. Due to the number of DDoS incidents, these are shown on a separate graph. The DDoS attacks peaked drastically in August and September, to an extent that they overshadowed some of the other categories. In January, wipers and defacement were most prevalent, with cyber espionage and wipers being the most prevalent in March and April. This speaks to how cyber operations are used by Russia. The use of volunteers for Ukraine is discussed in more detail later. A report by Microsoft concurred that most destructive attacks (for example, wipers) occurred in the first week of the conflict, and  $40\\%$  of the destructive attacks targeted critical infrastructure (Digital Security Unit 2022).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\n(b) DDoS and total\nFigure 6: Types of cyber operations per month (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFrom Figure 7, it is evident that hacking collectives are by far the most prevalent threat actor type, followed by nation-state actors. This further demonstrates the role of non-state actors in the cyber domain during the conflict. Of the 65 unique threat actors identified by the CyberPeace Institute, 38 were supporting Russia and 27 were supporting Ukraine. Two interesting threat actors supporting Russia originated from Brazil and Iraq (CyberPeace Institute 2022), which falls outside of the usual online belligerents related to the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The weighting towards the\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\ncollectives is not necessarily unusual; however, Ukraine did follow a strategy of openly calling for international cyber volunteers to support its cyber operations (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022). This, however, raises concerns that, while such volunteers and hacktivists are often seen during times of heightened political tension, their presence when there is an actual physical conflict could unintentionally involve countries that are essentially neutral, or the cyber volunteers could potentially be classified as mercenaries or combatants and open themselves (and the country they reside in) to retaliation. In addition to the volunteers, cybercriminal groups openly chose sides . However, a ransomware gang that declared its support for Russia experienced leaks of information, thought to be Ukrainian members of the group retaliating; these leaks provided useful insights into the operations of ransomware groups .\nFigure 7: Types of threat actors (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 8 illustrates the types of cyber operations that each threat actor type was conducting. The collectives overwhelmingly favoured DDoS and hack and leak operations; nation state actors accounted for more cyber espionage, 'other' incidents, and wipers. Given the timing of the hack and leak operations shown in Figure 6(a), and the prevalence of hack and leak operations against Russia (Figure 3) and that they were committed by collectives, it can be deduced that these may have been volunteers targeting Russia in retaliation for the invasion and the for the support of cyber operations. Similarly, globally there were a number of DDoS attacks from August to October (Figure 6[a]), also conducted by collectives. These largely affected global targets, but also Ukraine and Russia. Some of these DDoS attacks could have grown out of frustration by pro-Russian groups of the waning support to Russia; for example, multiple websites of the Bulgarian Government were targeted for what the perpetrator claimed was the Bulgarian betrayal of Russia . A situation may have arisen where various hacking collectives began targeting countries as a series of reprisals; van Niekerk and Maharaj (2011) predicted this as a likely occurrence in a cyber conflict, based on a series of retaliatory cyber incidents in support of either Wikileaks or the U.S. government in 2010.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(b) DDoS and Total\nFigure 8: Types of incident per threat actor type (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nSome notable incidents include a cyber operation against a broadband satellite provider, Viasat, on 24 February . This illustrates a continuation of the practice of targeting media and communication platforms alongside the initial military operations. In addition to significant damage to the terminals at Viasat, the 'collateral damage' of the incident affected parts of Europe, including remote access to over 5000 wind turbines in Germany . A border control station between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly affected by a wiper malware on 25 February, slowing down the processing of Ukrainian refugees . A number of cyber operations against industrial systems were reported: Belarusian hacktivist collectives claimed that they targeted railway systems to hinder Russian troop movements (Gallagher &amp; Bloomberg 2022); cyber operations (which ultimately failed) targeting power companies that included wiper malware as well as an updated version of the malware used to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 were found, (ESET Research 2022; Goodchild 2022). In addition, a Russian taxi operator was compromised and all taxis were instructed to go to the same location in Moscow, causing a traffic jam . These attacks are outside of the usual website defacements and DDoS attacks that have traditionally been exhibited during times of conflict.\nObservers commented on the lack of visible cyber operations by Russia after the early stages of the conflict, as it was expected by some to have been much greater by several researchers (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022; Schneider 2022). By comparison, Russia appeared a much greater cyber power in relation to Ukraine: the National Cyber Power Index 2020 listed Russia as  $4^{\\text{th}}$  and Ukraine as  $26^{\\text{th}}$  of 30 countries ; therefore, a strong presence by Russia in the cyber arena would have made sense. Proposed reasons for the quieter than expected cyber domain are that, in a physical conflict, kinetic weapons are more useful and cyber operations are more suited for deception and deniability, making them ideal for use outside of open conflict (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022). Urchill (2022) indicates that the attempts against the Ukrainian power grid indicate that cyber operations were active, which negates the growing narrative that they were quiet. The number of cyber incidents recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b) and illustrated by the figures above indicate that there was a significant amount\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof activity. While there were attacks on critical infrastructure, they did not succeed due to (at least in part) assistance that Ukraine received . In addition to the volunteers supporting Ukraine mentioned above, there was formal foreign assistance, including ‘hunt forward' operations by the U.S. Cyber Command . The scope of the foreign assistance included forward deployments and remote assistance for cyber defence by both vendors and official personnel, the sharing of threat intelligence, and services provided to improve the resilience of Ukrainian systems, such as migrating to Cloud storage .\nThe coordination of cyber operations with physical military operations by Russian forces is illustrated in general by the Microsoft report, where both physical and virtual attacks appear to drive at the same objective (Digital Security Unit 2022). Specific examples include the Viasat (a contractor for the Ukrainian military) incident, mentioned above, is a contractor for the Ukrainian military) and coordinated cyber and kinetic attacks against power companies . In addition, propaganda and information operations overlap with cyber operations, indicated by the cyber-enabled information operations in Figures 1 through 4, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. The cyber dimension has therefore played an important role in the conflict, although it did not achieve the full potential and the inherit limitations still preclude it from having a direct impact on the battlefield (van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk & Ramluckan 2022).",
    "## Psychological operations, disinformation, and influence campaigns": "Information warfare in the cognitive domain is a key aspect of any conflict. Within the Rusian Ukraine war, there was a heavy cyber-enabled component to disinformation (including use of a deepfake and media manipulation), as well as some traditional PSYOP techniques. Immediately prior to and in the early days of the Russian invasion, disinformation was disseminated by SMS and social media, including the use of compromised social media accounts. In addition, the media and communication sectors were targeted by cyber operations (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In addition to affecting command and control, targeting such sectors reduced the amount of information that the government could provide to its citizens or to the outside world, in theory giving the Russian narrative more dominance.\nFacebook and Instagram accounts were used to spoof European news sites, publishing disinformation to over 60 websites; upon identifying the operation which began in May, Meta disabled the offending accounts. It was reported that this was the largest disinformation operation since the beginning of the conflict, and it used “an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force” . It was found that bots spreading disinformation against the U.S. reduced the amount of anti-vaccination content and increased pro-Russian content during the first months of the war; however, this effort did not gain traction . Over 300 disinformation sites related to the war were identified, and a number of narratives were shared including; a fighter pilot known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv' shooting down Russian aircraft, a deepfake of President Zelensky calling for surrender, U.S. bioweapons labs in Europe, videos of a President Putin in jail due to a coup, and examples of media manipulation to discredit Ukrainian government officials . In Hungary, traditional billboards were used to equate the sanctions against Russia to armed attacks and styling them as excessive . This is an example that ‘traditional' influence is still present, despite the move to the digital environment.\nCertain themes were again present, particularly accusations of Nazism. However, some claims had been taken too far, prompting President Putin to make an apology (Bella, Hendrix & Ilyushin 2022). However, the symbols painted on Russian military vehicles gained their own status, akin to the Nazi use of the swastika. The various symbols caused much speculation, but one in particular, ‘Z', has become a symbol for the Russian aggression and is seen as a pro-war symbol . This association has led some organisations to change their logos and some European countries to ban the public display of the symbol, although these moves have also been used to make claims of Russophobia .\nA difference between 2014 and 2022 is that Ukraine had a fledgling government when Crimea was annexed it just having ousted the pro-Russian government; in 2022, the government was more stable and had years of experience dealing with disinformation and the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Zelensky's repeated presentations at national forums calling for assistance and sanctions aided in providing an almost unified front against Russia. The Ukrainian propaganda portraying heroism was particularly successful and the overall influence of the propaganda effort was key to keep the flow of funding and weapons as well as the sanctions in place . By contrast, the Russian propaganda effort appeared to be thinly disguised distraction and dismissal to Western audiences, often making false claims against Ukraine or the U.S. (such as that they were using dirty bombs or counter-accusations of war crimes), continuing the 4Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay) seen in previous iterations of the boarder conflict. While there was more international engagement, such as speeches by Minister Lavrov which were met by walkouts . However, the walkouts could be presented to the Russian population as evidence of a hostile West, and the speeches could be aimed at the Russian population rather than the immediate audience. The Russian internal-facing propaganda appeared to be somewhat effective, with many Russians not believing there was a war in Ukraine and then later believing that Russia could win .",
    "## Other areas of IW": "This section focuses on the reports of intelligence and electronic warfare activities during the conflict. A notable aspect was proactive intelligence disclosures by the U.S. predicting the invasion and the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines . The increasingly important role of open-source intelligence that was reinforced by the Russian invasion is highlighted by Wait (2022a), where valuable information could be obtained from the Internet and social media in particular, and collectives of investigative journalists were able to aid in providing attribution.\nFor EW, there were reports that flights from Estonia to Finland had to return due to GPS interference, which had also been detected along the Finland-Russian border . The Starlink satellite systems provided to Ukraine reportedly experienced jamming; however, it was claimed that this was resolved after a software update . Russian media reported that a NATO drone had been jammed over the Black Sea . While both sides have used EW, indications are that the Russian use has improved since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular its EW units are now learning to counter NATO equipment that has been supplied to Ukraine . The Ukrainian government urged citizens to aid the military by disrupting Russian support units, with communications and EW units being emphasised as a target ; this may be an indication that the Russian EW was having an impact on the\nbattlefield. The EW in the conflict is being used to inform the U.S. military's planning; in addition, Russian EW equipment found abandoned will probably provide useful intelligence .",
    "## Discussion": "From the descriptions above, IW has had an important role to play in the conflicts in Ukraine. While in some aspects there are new activities, others have remained constant or have shown gradual evolution.\nSome of the key differences from 2014 to 2022 include multinational support, both through organisations and official representation, that has aided Ukraine in the 2022 conflict. This extends beyond the financing and weapons delivery, but includes active support in the cyber domain, with foreign intelligence services admitting to conducting operations to bolster the defence of Ukraine's cyberspace. These include the deployment of forward-hunting operations to aid in disabling hostile cyberoperations; however, these will also prove useful in gathering intelligence on Russian cyber capabilities.\nThe use of wiper malware, being more destructive and targeting infrastructure, as well as hack and leak operations are new tactics in the cyber domain, even though the use of DDoS and website defacements were still prevalent. There appeared to be increased targeting of industrial systems, including satellite communications. While there were incidents between the two major stages of armed conflict, these may have been in preparation for a major military incursion into Ukraine. The number of attempts against Ukrainian power utilities, although largely foiled from causing widespread outages, indicates that this may have been part of a strategy to force the Ukrainian population into submission and to hasten a military conquest of the country. It is possible that there was an over-reliance on these aspects, and, when they failed, the troops on the ground met much stiffer resistance than expected.\nThe potential for increased cyber operations resulted in more attention to the environment, and active tracking of reported incidents by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), giving a detailed record of alleged incidents. This has given more insight into the use of cyber operations than during any prior political crisis or conflict. In addition, open calls by the Ukrainian government for a ‘volunteer cyber army' represented the first time a nation has publicly encouraged civilians to engage in hostile cyber activity against another nation on such a scale. This will have contributed to the increased cyber activity, but also raises several questions which, until that point, had been rhetorical: how would civilians engaging in cyber operations against a state during a time of armed conflict be classified, and what measure can be taken against them in order to protect critical systems?\nDisinformation and influence operations played a role from 2014 through 2022. A difference was that the current Ukrainian government had been in place when the conflict started, and had more experience dealing with influence campaigns than the government that had just taken office in 2014. This has shown in the way the Ukrainian government, led by President Zelensky, has engaged with other world leaders to solidify support for its war efforts.\nLeading up to the Russian invasion in 2022, unprecedented proactive intelligence disclosures were made warning of the impending invasion, and subsequently for the attacks on the Nordstream pipelines. However, similar attempts were made by Russia which were received as falsehoods in\nthat the same accusations were levelled against Russia. This may change the nature of intelligence sharing and make intelligence more open source.\nDespite some differences and new techniques and tactics, there are similarities from 2014 to 2022. Hacktivist involvement, website defacement, and DDoS attacks are ever-present factors. Cyber operations were coordinated with physical operations; however, there seems to be an evolution to include new targets and methods as discussed above. In both 2014 and 2022, observers commented that they thought cyber operations would play a larger role than what materialised; however, the number of cyber incidents has grown significantly. The prevailing theory, which is supported by evidence, is that cyber operations are more suitable for use outside of open armed conflict, and that what did occur in 2022 had limited military tactical benefit, as indicated by van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk, and Ramluckan (2022). The opposing view was that the heightened preparedness and international support blunted the impact of the initial aggressive cyber operations.\nIn the cognitive domain, similar narratives for disinformation and influence operations were prevalent, and similar tactics remained from 2014 through 2022. On the intelligence front, the role of open source intelligence, fuelled in part by social media remained; however, this is evolving to become more prevalent, as posited by van Niekerk (2015).",
    "## Conclusion": "Information warfare has played a significant part in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, since the Maidan uprisings overthrowing the pro-Russian Ukrainian government, through the annexation of Crimea, the separatist movements in the East, up to and including the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict. This history provides a particularly useful case study to investigate how IW has evolved (and remained the same) over the eight-year period.\nSome new tactics, particularly in the cyber domain—such as wipers and infrastructure attacks—emerged in 2022 compared to 2014; however, between 2015 and 2017, these appeared to have been tested. International support aided in the Ukrainian war effort, including forward-hunting teams for cyber defence and proactive intelligence disclosures. Electronic warfare use appeared to remain constant throughout. Disinformation and influence operations also remained constant, as did some of the major narratives; however, in 2022, this was a more contested space, compared to 2014.\nWhile the future remains uncertain, cyber operations may not play a major role on the battlefield for the foreseeable future; however, the quantity and intensity of cyber operations due to conflict and particularly immediately preceding conflict may continue to grow, as is evidenced from what happened between 2014 and 2022. Similarly, disinformation and influence operations are likely to intensify with some evolution. Intelligence may show the largest evolution going forward, with more open releases and greater use of open sources, given the pervasive connectivity of devices and information posted on social media."

In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.\nKeywords: Cyber operations, Disinformation, Information Warfare, Intelligence Disclosures, Volunteer Cyber Army\n# Introduction\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered into Ukrainian sovereign territory in what was termed a 'special military operation'. This had followed weeks of the forces building up along the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus, which were claimed to be exercises with denials on any impending military action against Ukraine. The broader conflict began in 2014 after anti-government protests from late 2013 successfully ousted the pro-Russian government in Kyiv. The Russian annexation of Crimea occurred shortly thereafter, followed by a low-intensity conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Alongside these activities in the physical domain, the conflict was also occurring in the information domain.\nThere is no consistent approach to the concept of information warfare (IW), which has also undergone evolution over the last two decades. For the purposes of this article, IW is considered to be an encompassing concept of activities in the physical, logical, and cognitive domains that seek to impact or protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (van Niekerk 2015). Information warfare can be considered to be comprised of:\n- Cyber operations\n- Influence operations, disinformation, propaganda, and psychological operations\n- Electronic warfare\n- Intelligence\nJournal of Information Warfare (2023) 22.1: 10-31\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nThe article considers openly available reports of IW activity during the conflict in Ukraine to illustrate the evolution of tactics from 2014 up to and including 2022. The next section provides an overview of key IW activity in the 2014 crisis and annexation of Crimea. This is followed by the relevant activity between the main events of 2014 and 2022. The next section covers the IW activity during the 2022 conflict. Thereafter, a discussion to highlight the key evolutions of IW is conducted, and the article is then concluded.\n# Information Warfare in the 2014 Protests and the Annexation of Crimea\nThe use of IW in the 2014 Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea were discussed in-depth previously by the author (van Niekerk 2015). This section will provide a summary of key points from that chapter, which provides as a baseline against which the IW activities in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict can be benchmarked. The crisis in Ukraine began at the end of 2013 with protests against the pro-Russian government, during which social media played a role. In 2014, as the protests continued, security forces became violent, resulting in the protests intensifying and the situation escalating. Eventually the Ukrainian president fled to Russia, and a new government was installed by 23 February 2014. However, pro-Russian protests began, and social media was used to divide ethnic Russians by spreading fear, which the new government did not address. A week later, armed militia began seizing key points in Crimea, and, in early March, a video emerged of Russian-made military equipment entering Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied the forces were theirs, but by 16 March a referendum had been held, claiming that the majority of Crimeans wished to join Russia, completing the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Subsequently, pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine began seizing buildings and a period of low-intensity conflict began, during which the downing of MH17 occurred. The diplomatic response to these actions was the implementation and increasing sanctions on Russia, and Russia putting pressure on Ukraine to pay for gas supplies.\nThe protests in Ukraine were a useful case study, as they could be benchmarked against the Orange Revolution of 2004, prior to extensive use of social media in popular uprisings. This comparison illustrated that social media gave anti-government protestors and journalists a platform for mass-dissemination of information outside of the state-controlled traditional media, and that the protestors found this information more reliable than formal news platforms . During the incursion in Crimea, Russian media made numerous claims which indicated chaos and mass defections in Ukraine, many of which were shown to be inaccurate; in addition, images began showing that the forces in Crimea were in fact Russian, as images of the same individuals were shown from the Russian incursion into Georgia in 2008 (van Niekerk 2015). A key perspective was provided by Kates and Butorin (2014), who indicated that the Russian media was providing a reality to their target audience, namely the Russian population, in order to maintain support, and this did not necessarily align with reality. This was generally successful as a majority of the Russian population trusted the Russian media, and the persistent rhetoric dominated over other sources provided an 'alternate' truth (Kates &amp; Butorin 2014). The use of pro-Russian 'trolls' to discredit social media and blog posters was reported, indicating attempts to dominate the narrative on social media and online (chornajuravka 2014).\nCyber operations were present prior to and during the annexation of Crimea, in particular cyber-espionage, distributed denial of service attacks, and website defacements. Cyber-espionage campaigns were present well before the crisis in 2013/2014, with a number of campaigns targeting Ukraine and other nations within the Russian sphere of influence and with another cyber-espionage\nJournal of Information Warfare\ncampaign predominantly targeting Ukraine in 2013 and 2014 (van Niekerk 2015). One particular cyber-espionage campaign of 2013 bears specific mention in that the lure was fake Ukrainian foreign policy documents purporting to show Ukraine's plans to seek NATO membership . As the narratives giving rise to the tensions in 2014, and as discussed later in 2022, this theme becomes core. Webpage defacements had begun in early November 2013, pre-dating the protests; however, the themes are worth recognition in the context of this article: the defacement of Ukrainian government websites and the distribution of false emails both contained a message claiming to be from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence . During the initial stages of armed incursion in Crimea, webpage defacements targeting the Russian government and organisations routinely used the term ‘Nazi” (van Niekerk 2015).\nThe most common cyber incident was DDoS attacks. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was targeted in retaliation for the alleged hacks mentioned above . A notable tactic was the use of DDoS attacks in conjunction with physical attacks against the communication infrastructure during the early stages of the armed incursion into Crimea, which disrupted the Ukrainian forces' based in Crimea ability to communicate; in addition, mobile phones of the Ukrainian parliament were disrupted . This tactic was seen previously in the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The DDoS attacks also became prevalent prior to the scheduled Crimean referendum to join Russia—although the majority of DDoS incidents were claimed by hacktivist groups (van Niekerk 2015). Commentary on the cyber incidents surrounding the Ukrainian political crisis and the annexation of Crimea indicated surprise about the limited and constrained use of cyber operations by Russia, with suggestions that the Ukrainian hackers were more skilled and could mount stronger retaliations .\nIn May 2014, there was an attempt to disrupt and interfere with the Ukrainian 2014 presidential election. Clayton (2014b) indicates attempts were made to delete data, leak information, alter the voting totals (with the use of malware), and then disrupt access with a DDoS attack. The attack was attributed to a pro-Russian hacktivist group; however, this has been refuted (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). A disinformation operation was coordinated with the attempt to alter voting data, as a Russian news channel incorrectly reported a win of the pro-Russian candidate with the same voting percentages that the above-mentioned malware attempted to insert into the voting platform. This implies a concerted effort to use cyber operations and disinformation to ‘hijack' the election in a way that aligned with the Russian propaganda narrative .\nThe use of electronic warfare appeared limited, with only a single report, which claimed that Russian satellite television had been jammed . From an intelligence perspective, social media proved to be useful for open source intelligence; where videos of troop movements appeared, selfies aided in identifying possible Russian troops and aided in attribution for the downing of flight MH17 (van Niekerk 2015).\nIn summary, the IW activities in 2014 began exhibiting boarder coordination amongst cyber operations, the propaganda effort, and physical operations on the ground. The IW operations did not stop, but a few notable incidents occurred between the major events of 2014 and 2022, which will be covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the ‘Inter-War' Period\nBetween the main events of 2014, as described above, and the direct military conflict in 2022\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(discussed in the next section), a number of information warfare activities occurred that were notable. Of key interest are a series of cyber operations which demonstrated the potential for significant impact and disruption through cyber means, and some foreshadowed other similar events that occurred subsequently.\nIn December of both 2015 and 2016, malware impacted parts of the Ukrainian electricity grid, resulting in a loss of power to the areas serviced by the affected substations. In 2015, 16 substations were affected, disrupting the electricity supply for up to six hours for over 200,000 customers. This malware was attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Sandworm (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In 2016 another APT, known as Electrum with reported links to the Sandworm APT, caused a shorter disruption, which affected about a fifth of Kyiv's supply. However, the functionality of the malware indicated the potential for causing broader cascading effects across the power grid (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Dragos 2017). In October 2016 it was reported that a Ukrainian hacktivist group had conducted a 'hack and leak' operation against a senior Russian official's emails, which provided evidence that Russia was involved in the 2014 separatist movements .\nIn June 2017, a modified version of the Petya ransomware appeared to target Ukrainian organisations, but then rapidly spread globally in what is the most expensive cyber incident recorded. The malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability, used by the WannaCry ransomware worm the month before, but it was also modified so the encryption was irreversible, resulting in it being renamed NotPetya and reclassified as a wiper. While NotPetya was known for its global financial impact that exceeded 10 billion USD and disrupted shipping company Maersk, it impacted a number of Ukrainian organisations, including radiation monitoring at Chernobyl (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Greenberg 2018). In 2018, a water filtration plant experienced a cyber operation attributed to Russia, which was reportedly fended off. The operation employed the VPNFilter malware that targeted networking devices . Slowik (2018) indicates that the technical details are scarce, and the fact that the malware originally could only intercept traffic and not modify it indicates that this may have been intelligence gathering to prepare for a cyber operation against the plant, rather than being able to affect the integrity of the industrial systems in any way.\nUkraine has been described as a 'testing ground' for cyber operations: in addition to the widely reported Russian cyber operations, there are a multitude of cyber-espionage operations reported in Eastern Ukraine ostensibly collecting intelligence on the situation there . The cyber operations described above exhibit a worrying trend, in that industrial controls systems could be targeted and could cause disruption to critical infrastructure; also of concern is the scale of the 'collateral damage' that NotPetya caused. Such cyber operations are clearly strategic and are intended to target civilian infrastructure, possibly to erode daily functioning of a country as well as the psychological resilience of the population. In this sense, cyber operations are being used, or at least attempted to being used, in a manner similar to strategic bombers of World War II, albeit with more precision and less physical destruction.\nPropaganda was a continuous feature surrounding the separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine, where the narratives echoed that of Russian and former Soviet propaganda, with some echoes of World War II. These narratives also indicate a type of extremist viewpoint, where the separatists portray themselves as heroically protecting their values, but are victims of overwhelming hostile adversaries: primarily Ukraine, supported by the majority of the world (Kostyuchenko &amp; Pushkar\nJournal of Information Warfare\n2022). During the COVID pandemic, the separatist groups spread conspiracy theories to erode confidence in the government measures and also suggested that the U.S. biolabs created the virus . Doroshenko and Lukito (2021) illustrate that pro-Russian influence operations related to Ukraine are an evolution of the Cold War concept of reflexive control for the digital world. These operations engage with the audience in such a way that their decision making is favourable to the objectives of the perpetrator. In an attempt to counter influence operations and propaganda for war in the context of Ukraine, Richter (2015) contends that countries utilised their own local laws, whereas a set of international norms might have proven to be more effective. While little is reported of EW use during this period, Russian EW units have reportedly supported the separatists by distributing propaganda over cellular phone networks in addition to disrupting and detecting (for targeting purposes) Ukrainian communications .\nWhile IW operations were not as intense in terms of the amount outside of major military operations (or less attention was being paid to the IW activities), they were still present. During this period some of the most notable cyber operations were conducted, namely NotPetya and the attacks against the electric grid, taking a step closer to what could potentially produce a blackout across major portions of a country. These operations appeared to be preparation for what was to come in 2022, which is covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Conflict\nDue to the amount of information available about the IW efforts in the 2022 conflict, this section will be divided to focus on specific areas; however, there may still be overlaps (for example cyber-enabled influence operations). Cyber operations are discussed first, followed by influence operations, and then a section on other notable IW activities during the conflict.\n## Cyber operations\nThe number of recorded cyber operations for the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict is notable; it is possible that there was more activity, but at the same time there was more attention to cyber operations during the conflict. The CyberPeace Institute (2022b) has an interactive portal dedicated to tracking cyber incidents during the conflict, and recorded 626 alleged incidents in 2022 related to the Ukraine conflict; this averages to nearly two incidents per day.\nIn January there were some wiper attacks, website defacements of government websites, and attempts to compromise government organisations. In February, incidents of cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, and disinformation were reported. Immediately preceding the invasion (23 February), more DDoS attacks, wipers, and ransomware were reported. During the initial stages of the Russian incursion into Ukraine (24-25 February), DDoS, wipers, phishing, social media-based disinformation, and website compromises were seen; the DDoS attacks and disinformation continued to late February, and in early March cyber operations targeted the media and communications sector, and malware targeted non-government organisations (CyberPeace Institute 2022b).\nFigure 1 illustrates the composition of the 626 cyber-operations recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), categorised into 10 incident types from January to October. As is evident from the figure, the majority of the incidents were DDoS, followed by hack and leak operations. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalent categories of 201 cyber incidents that targeted Ukraine; the 158 incidents that targeted Russia are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 illustrates the categories of 267 incidents\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nrelated to the conflict that targeted nations or organisations globally. DDoS attacks were the most prevalent type, targeting Ukraine and global targets, while hack and leak operations were the most prevalent against Russia.\nFigure 1: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 2: Types of cyber operations targeting Ukraine, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 3: Types of cyber operations targeting Russia, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 4: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict targeting the rest of the world, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of cyber incidents per month. Those targeting Ukraine began in January, increased in February, with an initial peak in March. Many of these may have been preparatory in nature, as with previous conflicts, to disrupt communication and disseminate disinformation in an attempt to dominate the information sphere during the early stages of the conflict. Those targeting Russia began in February, with an increase in March, and initial peak in April. These lagged the incidents against Ukraine by a month, and were probably retaliatory in nature. The incidents with global impact began in January, with a slight increase in February, peaking in April. However, the decline was slower than that of Russia and Ukraine. All areas experienced second peaks from August to October.\nFigure 5: Number of cyber operations targeting the belligerents (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 6 illustrates the number of incidents for each category per month. Due to the number of DDoS incidents, these are shown on a separate graph. The DDoS attacks peaked drastically in August and September, to an extent that they overshadowed some of the other categories. In January, wipers and defacement were most prevalent, with cyber espionage and wipers being the most prevalent in March and April. This speaks to how cyber operations are used by Russia. The use of volunteers for Ukraine is discussed in more detail later. A report by Microsoft concurred that most destructive attacks (for example, wipers) occurred in the first week of the conflict, and  $40\\%$  of the destructive attacks targeted critical infrastructure (Digital Security Unit 2022).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\n(b) DDoS and total\nFigure 6: Types of cyber operations per month (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFrom Figure 7, it is evident that hacking collectives are by far the most prevalent threat actor type, followed by nation-state actors. This further demonstrates the role of non-state actors in the cyber domain during the conflict. Of the 65 unique threat actors identified by the CyberPeace Institute, 38 were supporting Russia and 27 were supporting Ukraine. Two interesting threat actors supporting Russia originated from Brazil and Iraq (CyberPeace Institute 2022), which falls outside of the usual online belligerents related to the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The weighting towards the\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\ncollectives is not necessarily unusual; however, Ukraine did follow a strategy of openly calling for international cyber volunteers to support its cyber operations (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022). This, however, raises concerns that, while such volunteers and hacktivists are often seen during times of heightened political tension, their presence when there is an actual physical conflict could unintentionally involve countries that are essentially neutral, or the cyber volunteers could potentially be classified as mercenaries or combatants and open themselves (and the country they reside in) to retaliation. In addition to the volunteers, cybercriminal groups openly chose sides . However, a ransomware gang that declared its support for Russia experienced leaks of information, thought to be Ukrainian members of the group retaliating; these leaks provided useful insights into the operations of ransomware groups .\nFigure 7: Types of threat actors (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 8 illustrates the types of cyber operations that each threat actor type was conducting. The collectives overwhelmingly favoured DDoS and hack and leak operations; nation state actors accounted for more cyber espionage, 'other' incidents, and wipers. Given the timing of the hack and leak operations shown in Figure 6(a), and the prevalence of hack and leak operations against Russia (Figure 3) and that they were committed by collectives, it can be deduced that these may have been volunteers targeting Russia in retaliation for the invasion and the for the support of cyber operations. Similarly, globally there were a number of DDoS attacks from August to October (Figure 6[a]), also conducted by collectives. These largely affected global targets, but also Ukraine and Russia. Some of these DDoS attacks could have grown out of frustration by pro-Russian groups of the waning support to Russia; for example, multiple websites of the Bulgarian Government were targeted for what the perpetrator claimed was the Bulgarian betrayal of Russia . A situation may have arisen where various hacking collectives began targeting countries as a series of reprisals; van Niekerk and Maharaj (2011) predicted this as a likely occurrence in a cyber conflict, based on a series of retaliatory cyber incidents in support of either Wikileaks or the U.S. government in 2010.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(b) DDoS and Total\nFigure 8: Types of incident per threat actor type (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nSome notable incidents include a cyber operation against a broadband satellite provider, Viasat, on 24 February . This illustrates a continuation of the practice of targeting media and communication platforms alongside the initial military operations. In addition to significant damage to the terminals at Viasat, the 'collateral damage' of the incident affected parts of Europe, including remote access to over 5000 wind turbines in Germany . A border control station between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly affected by a wiper malware on 25 February, slowing down the processing of Ukrainian refugees . A number of cyber operations against industrial systems were reported: Belarusian hacktivist collectives claimed that they targeted railway systems to hinder Russian troop movements (Gallagher &amp; Bloomberg 2022); cyber operations (which ultimately failed) targeting power companies that included wiper malware as well as an updated version of the malware used to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 were found, (ESET Research 2022; Goodchild 2022). In addition, a Russian taxi operator was compromised and all taxis were instructed to go to the same location in Moscow, causing a traffic jam . These attacks are outside of the usual website defacements and DDoS attacks that have traditionally been exhibited during times of conflict.\nObservers commented on the lack of visible cyber operations by Russia after the early stages of the conflict, as it was expected by some to have been much greater by several researchers (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022; Schneider 2022). By comparison, Russia appeared a much greater cyber power in relation to Ukraine: the National Cyber Power Index 2020 listed Russia as  $4^{\\text{th}}$  and Ukraine as  $26^{\\text{th}}$  of 30 countries ; therefore, a strong presence by Russia in the cyber arena would have made sense. Proposed reasons for the quieter than expected cyber domain are that, in a physical conflict, kinetic weapons are more useful and cyber operations are more suited for deception and deniability, making them ideal for use outside of open conflict (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022). Urchill (2022) indicates that the attempts against the Ukrainian power grid indicate that cyber operations were active, which negates the growing narrative that they were quiet. The number of cyber incidents recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b) and illustrated by the figures above indicate that there was a significant amount\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof activity. While there were attacks on critical infrastructure, they did not succeed due to (at least in part) assistance that Ukraine received . In addition to the volunteers supporting Ukraine mentioned above, there was formal foreign assistance, including ‘hunt forward' operations by the U.S. Cyber Command . The scope of the foreign assistance included forward deployments and remote assistance for cyber defence by both vendors and official personnel, the sharing of threat intelligence, and services provided to improve the resilience of Ukrainian systems, such as migrating to Cloud storage .\nThe coordination of cyber operations with physical military operations by Russian forces is illustrated in general by the Microsoft report, where both physical and virtual attacks appear to drive at the same objective (Digital Security Unit 2022). Specific examples include the Viasat (a contractor for the Ukrainian military) incident, mentioned above, is a contractor for the Ukrainian military) and coordinated cyber and kinetic attacks against power companies . In addition, propaganda and information operations overlap with cyber operations, indicated by the cyber-enabled information operations in Figures 1 through 4, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. The cyber dimension has therefore played an important role in the conflict, although it did not achieve the full potential and the inherit limitations still preclude it from having a direct impact on the battlefield (van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk & Ramluckan 2022).\n## Psychological operations, disinformation, and influence campaigns\nInformation warfare in the cognitive domain is a key aspect of any conflict. Within the Rusian Ukraine war, there was a heavy cyber-enabled component to disinformation (including use of a deepfake and media manipulation), as well as some traditional PSYOP techniques. Immediately prior to and in the early days of the Russian invasion, disinformation was disseminated by SMS and social media, including the use of compromised social media accounts. In addition, the media and communication sectors were targeted by cyber operations (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In addition to affecting command and control, targeting such sectors reduced the amount of information that the government could provide to its citizens or to the outside world, in theory giving the Russian narrative more dominance.\nFacebook and Instagram accounts were used to spoof European news sites, publishing disinformation to over 60 websites; upon identifying the operation which began in May, Meta disabled the offending accounts. It was reported that this was the largest disinformation operation since the beginning of the conflict, and it used “an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force” . It was found that bots spreading disinformation against the U.S. reduced the amount of anti-vaccination content and increased pro-Russian content during the first months of the war; however, this effort did not gain traction . Over 300 disinformation sites related to the war were identified, and a number of narratives were shared including; a fighter pilot known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv' shooting down Russian aircraft, a deepfake of President Zelensky calling for surrender, U.S. bioweapons labs in Europe, videos of a President Putin in jail due to a coup, and examples of media manipulation to discredit Ukrainian government officials . In Hungary, traditional billboards were used to equate the sanctions against Russia to armed attacks and styling them as excessive . This is an example that ‘traditional' influence is still present, despite the move to the digital environment.\nCertain themes were again present, particularly accusations of Nazism. However, some claims had been taken too far, prompting President Putin to make an apology (Bella, Hendrix & Ilyushin 2022). However, the symbols painted on Russian military vehicles gained their own status, akin to the Nazi use of the swastika. The various symbols caused much speculation, but one in particular, ‘Z', has become a symbol for the Russian aggression and is seen as a pro-war symbol . This association has led some organisations to change their logos and some European countries to ban the public display of the symbol, although these moves have also been used to make claims of Russophobia .\nA difference between 2014 and 2022 is that Ukraine had a fledgling government when Crimea was annexed it just having ousted the pro-Russian government; in 2022, the government was more stable and had years of experience dealing with disinformation and the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Zelensky's repeated presentations at national forums calling for assistance and sanctions aided in providing an almost unified front against Russia. The Ukrainian propaganda portraying heroism was particularly successful and the overall influence of the propaganda effort was key to keep the flow of funding and weapons as well as the sanctions in place . By contrast, the Russian propaganda effort appeared to be thinly disguised distraction and dismissal to Western audiences, often making false claims against Ukraine or the U.S. (such as that they were using dirty bombs or counter-accusations of war crimes), continuing the 4Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay) seen in previous iterations of the boarder conflict. While there was more international engagement, such as speeches by Minister Lavrov which were met by walkouts . However, the walkouts could be presented to the Russian population as evidence of a hostile West, and the speeches could be aimed at the Russian population rather than the immediate audience. The Russian internal-facing propaganda appeared to be somewhat effective, with many Russians not believing there was a war in Ukraine and then later believing that Russia could win .\n## Other areas of IW\nThis section focuses on the reports of intelligence and electronic warfare activities during the conflict. A notable aspect was proactive intelligence disclosures by the U.S. predicting the invasion and the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines . The increasingly important role of open-source intelligence that was reinforced by the Russian invasion is highlighted by Wait (2022a), where valuable information could be obtained from the Internet and social media in particular, and collectives of investigative journalists were able to aid in providing attribution.\nFor EW, there were reports that flights from Estonia to Finland had to return due to GPS interference, which had also been detected along the Finland-Russian border . The Starlink satellite systems provided to Ukraine reportedly experienced jamming; however, it was claimed that this was resolved after a software update . Russian media reported that a NATO drone had been jammed over the Black Sea . While both sides have used EW, indications are that the Russian use has improved since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular its EW units are now learning to counter NATO equipment that has been supplied to Ukraine . The Ukrainian government urged citizens to aid the military by disrupting Russian support units, with communications and EW units being emphasised as a target ; this may be an indication that the Russian EW was having an impact on the\nbattlefield. The EW in the conflict is being used to inform the U.S. military's planning; in addition, Russian EW equipment found abandoned will probably provide useful intelligence .\n## Discussion\nFrom the descriptions above, IW has had an important role to play in the conflicts in Ukraine. While in some aspects there are new activities, others have remained constant or have shown gradual evolution.\nSome of the key differences from 2014 to 2022 include multinational support, both through organisations and official representation, that has aided Ukraine in the 2022 conflict. This extends beyond the financing and weapons delivery, but includes active support in the cyber domain, with foreign intelligence services admitting to conducting operations to bolster the defence of Ukraine's cyberspace. These include the deployment of forward-hunting operations to aid in disabling hostile cyberoperations; however, these will also prove useful in gathering intelligence on Russian cyber capabilities.\nThe use of wiper malware, being more destructive and targeting infrastructure, as well as hack and leak operations are new tactics in the cyber domain, even though the use of DDoS and website defacements were still prevalent. There appeared to be increased targeting of industrial systems, including satellite communications. While there were incidents between the two major stages of armed conflict, these may have been in preparation for a major military incursion into Ukraine. The number of attempts against Ukrainian power utilities, although largely foiled from causing widespread outages, indicates that this may have been part of a strategy to force the Ukrainian population into submission and to hasten a military conquest of the country. It is possible that there was an over-reliance on these aspects, and, when they failed, the troops on the ground met much stiffer resistance than expected.\nThe potential for increased cyber operations resulted in more attention to the environment, and active tracking of reported incidents by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), giving a detailed record of alleged incidents. This has given more insight into the use of cyber operations than during any prior political crisis or conflict. In addition, open calls by the Ukrainian government for a ‘volunteer cyber army' represented the first time a nation has publicly encouraged civilians to engage in hostile cyber activity against another nation on such a scale. This will have contributed to the increased cyber activity, but also raises several questions which, until that point, had been rhetorical: how would civilians engaging in cyber operations against a state during a time of armed conflict be classified, and what measure can be taken against them in order to protect critical systems?\nDisinformation and influence operations played a role from 2014 through 2022. A difference was that the current Ukrainian government had been in place when the conflict started, and had more experience dealing with influence campaigns than the government that had just taken office in 2014. This has shown in the way the Ukrainian government, led by President Zelensky, has engaged with other world leaders to solidify support for its war efforts.\nLeading up to the Russian invasion in 2022, unprecedented proactive intelligence disclosures were made warning of the impending invasion, and subsequently for the attacks on the Nordstream pipelines. However, similar attempts were made by Russia which were received as falsehoods in\nthat the same accusations were levelled against Russia. This may change the nature of intelligence sharing and make intelligence more open source.\nDespite some differences and new techniques and tactics, there are similarities from 2014 to 2022. Hacktivist involvement, website defacement, and DDoS attacks are ever-present factors. Cyber operations were coordinated with physical operations; however, there seems to be an evolution to include new targets and methods as discussed above. In both 2014 and 2022, observers commented that they thought cyber operations would play a larger role than what materialised; however, the number of cyber incidents has grown significantly. The prevailing theory, which is supported by evidence, is that cyber operations are more suitable for use outside of open armed conflict, and that what did occur in 2022 had limited military tactical benefit, as indicated by van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk, and Ramluckan (2022). The opposing view was that the heightened preparedness and international support blunted the impact of the initial aggressive cyber operations.\nIn the cognitive domain, similar narratives for disinformation and influence operations were prevalent, and similar tactics remained from 2014 through 2022. On the intelligence front, the role of open source intelligence, fuelled in part by social media remained; however, this is evolving to become more prevalent, as posited by van Niekerk (2015).\n## Conclusion\nInformation warfare has played a significant part in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, since the Maidan uprisings overthrowing the pro-Russian Ukrainian government, through the annexation of Crimea, the separatist movements in the East, up to and including the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict. This history provides a particularly useful case study to investigate how IW has evolved (and remained the same) over the eight-year period.\nSome new tactics, particularly in the cyber domain—such as wipers and infrastructure attacks—emerged in 2022 compared to 2014; however, between 2015 and 2017, these appeared to have been tested. International support aided in the Ukrainian war effort, including forward-hunting teams for cyber defence and proactive intelligence disclosures. Electronic warfare use appeared to remain constant throughout. Disinformation and influence operations also remained constant, as did some of the major narratives; however, in 2022, this was a more contested space, compared to 2014.\nWhile the future remains uncertain, cyber operations may not play a major role on the battlefield for the foreseeable future; however, the quantity and intensity of cyber operations due to conflict and particularly immediately preceding conflict may continue to grow, as is evidenced from what happened between 2014 and 2022. Similarly, disinformation and influence operations are likely to intensify with some evolution. Intelligence may show the largest evolution going forward, with more open releases and greater use of open sources, given the pervasive connectivity of devices and information posted on social media.",

In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.\nKeywords: Cyber operations, Disinformation, Information Warfare, Intelligence Disclosures, Volunteer Cyber Army\n# Introduction\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered into Ukrainian sovereign territory in what was termed a 'special military operation'. This had followed weeks of the forces building up along the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus, which were claimed to be exercises with denials on any impending military action against Ukraine. The broader conflict began in 2014 after anti-government protests from late 2013 successfully ousted the pro-Russian government in Kyiv. The Russian annexation of Crimea occurred shortly thereafter, followed by a low-intensity conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Alongside these activities in the physical domain, the conflict was also occurring in the information domain.\nThere is no consistent approach to the concept of information warfare (IW), which has also undergone evolution over the last two decades. For the purposes of this article, IW is considered to be an encompassing concept of activities in the physical, logical, and cognitive domains that seek to impact or protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (van Niekerk 2015). Information warfare can be considered to be comprised of:\n- Cyber operations\n- Influence operations, disinformation, propaganda, and psychological operations\n- Electronic warfare\n- Intelligence\nJournal of Information Warfare (2023) 22.1: 10-31\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nThe article considers openly available reports of IW activity during the conflict in Ukraine to illustrate the evolution of tactics from 2014 up to and including 2022. The next section provides an overview of key IW activity in the 2014 crisis and annexation of Crimea. This is followed by the relevant activity between the main events of 2014 and 2022. The next section covers the IW activity during the 2022 conflict. Thereafter, a discussion to highlight the key evolutions of IW is conducted, and the article is then concluded.\n# Information Warfare in the 2014 Protests and the Annexation of Crimea\nThe use of IW in the 2014 Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea were discussed in-depth previously by the author (van Niekerk 2015). This section will provide a summary of key points from that chapter, which provides as a baseline against which the IW activities in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict can be benchmarked. The crisis in Ukraine began at the end of 2013 with protests against the pro-Russian government, during which social media played a role. In 2014, as the protests continued, security forces became violent, resulting in the protests intensifying and the situation escalating. Eventually the Ukrainian president fled to Russia, and a new government was installed by 23 February 2014. However, pro-Russian protests began, and social media was used to divide ethnic Russians by spreading fear, which the new government did not address. A week later, armed militia began seizing key points in Crimea, and, in early March, a video emerged of Russian-made military equipment entering Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied the forces were theirs, but by 16 March a referendum had been held, claiming that the majority of Crimeans wished to join Russia, completing the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Subsequently, pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine began seizing buildings and a period of low-intensity conflict began, during which the downing of MH17 occurred. The diplomatic response to these actions was the implementation and increasing sanctions on Russia, and Russia putting pressure on Ukraine to pay for gas supplies.\nThe protests in Ukraine were a useful case study, as they could be benchmarked against the Orange Revolution of 2004, prior to extensive use of social media in popular uprisings. This comparison illustrated that social media gave anti-government protestors and journalists a platform for mass-dissemination of information outside of the state-controlled traditional media, and that the protestors found this information more reliable than formal news platforms (Onuch 2014; Satell 2014). During the incursion in Crimea, Russian media made numerous claims which indicated chaos and mass defections in Ukraine, many of which were shown to be inaccurate; in addition, images began showing that the forces in Crimea were in fact Russian, as images of the same individuals were shown from the Russian incursion into Georgia in 2008 (van Niekerk 2015). A key perspective was provided by Kates and Butorin (2014), who indicated that the Russian media was providing a reality to their target audience, namely the Russian population, in order to maintain support, and this did not necessarily align with reality. This was generally successful as a majority of the Russian population trusted the Russian media, and the persistent rhetoric dominated over other sources provided an 'alternate' truth (Kates &amp; Butorin 2014). The use of pro-Russian 'trolls' to discredit social media and blog posters was reported, indicating attempts to dominate the narrative on social media and online (chornajuravka 2014).\nCyber operations were present prior to and during the annexation of Crimea, in particular cyber-espionage, distributed denial of service attacks, and website defacements. Cyber-espionage campaigns were present well before the crisis in 2013/2014, with a number of campaigns targeting Ukraine and other nations within the Russian sphere of influence and with another cyber-espionage\nJournal of Information Warfare\ncampaign predominantly targeting Ukraine in 2013 and 2014 (van Niekerk 2015). One particular cyber-espionage campaign of 2013 bears specific mention in that the lure was fake Ukrainian foreign policy documents purporting to show Ukraine's plans to seek NATO membership (Mimoso 2013). As the narratives giving rise to the tensions in 2014, and as discussed later in 2022, this theme becomes core. Webpage defacements had begun in early November 2013, pre-dating the protests; however, the themes are worth recognition in the context of this article: the defacement of Ukrainian government websites and the distribution of false emails both contained a message claiming to be from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Kovacs 2013). During the initial stages of armed incursion in Crimea, webpage defacements targeting the Russian government and organisations routinely used the term ‘Nazi” (van Niekerk 2015).\nThe most common cyber incident was DDoS attacks. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was targeted in retaliation for the alleged hacks mentioned above (Kovacs 2013). A notable tactic was the use of DDoS attacks in conjunction with physical attacks against the communication infrastructure during the early stages of the armed incursion into Crimea, which disrupted the Ukrainian forces' based in Crimea ability to communicate; in addition, mobile phones of the Ukrainian parliament were disrupted (Vamosi 2014). This tactic was seen previously in the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The DDoS attacks also became prevalent prior to the scheduled Crimean referendum to join Russia—although the majority of DDoS incidents were claimed by hacktivist groups (van Niekerk 2015). Commentary on the cyber incidents surrounding the Ukrainian political crisis and the annexation of Crimea indicated surprise about the limited and constrained use of cyber operations by Russia, with suggestions that the Ukrainian hackers were more skilled and could mount stronger retaliations (Clayton 2014a; Gady 2014).\nIn May 2014, there was an attempt to disrupt and interfere with the Ukrainian 2014 presidential election. Clayton (2014b) indicates attempts were made to delete data, leak information, alter the voting totals (with the use of malware), and then disrupt access with a DDoS attack. The attack was attributed to a pro-Russian hacktivist group; however, this has been refuted (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). A disinformation operation was coordinated with the attempt to alter voting data, as a Russian news channel incorrectly reported a win of the pro-Russian candidate with the same voting percentages that the above-mentioned malware attempted to insert into the voting platform. This implies a concerted effort to use cyber operations and disinformation to ‘hijack' the election in a way that aligned with the Russian propaganda narrative (Clayton 2014b).\nThe use of electronic warfare appeared limited, with only a single report, which claimed that Russian satellite television had been jammed (Rehle 2014). From an intelligence perspective, social media proved to be useful for open source intelligence; where videos of troop movements appeared, selfies aided in identifying possible Russian troops and aided in attribution for the downing of flight MH17 (van Niekerk 2015).\nIn summary, the IW activities in 2014 began exhibiting boarder coordination amongst cyber operations, the propaganda effort, and physical operations on the ground. The IW operations did not stop, but a few notable incidents occurred between the major events of 2014 and 2022, which will be covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the ‘Inter-War' Period\nBetween the main events of 2014, as described above, and the direct military conflict in 2022\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(discussed in the next section), a number of information warfare activities occurred that were notable. Of key interest are a series of cyber operations which demonstrated the potential for significant impact and disruption through cyber means, and some foreshadowed other similar events that occurred subsequently.\nIn December of both 2015 and 2016, malware impacted parts of the Ukrainian electricity grid, resulting in a loss of power to the areas serviced by the affected substations. In 2015, 16 substations were affected, disrupting the electricity supply for up to six hours for over 200,000 customers. This malware was attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Sandworm (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In 2016 another APT, known as Electrum with reported links to the Sandworm APT, caused a shorter disruption, which affected about a fifth of Kyiv's supply. However, the functionality of the malware indicated the potential for causing broader cascading effects across the power grid (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Dragos 2017). In October 2016 it was reported that a Ukrainian hacktivist group had conducted a 'hack and leak' operation against a senior Russian official's emails, which provided evidence that Russia was involved in the 2014 separatist movements (Kramer 2016).\nIn June 2017, a modified version of the Petya ransomware appeared to target Ukrainian organisations, but then rapidly spread globally in what is the most expensive cyber incident recorded. The malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability, used by the WannaCry ransomware worm the month before, but it was also modified so the encryption was irreversible, resulting in it being renamed NotPetya and reclassified as a wiper. While NotPetya was known for its global financial impact that exceeded 10 billion USD and disrupted shipping company Maersk, it impacted a number of Ukrainian organisations, including radiation monitoring at Chernobyl (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Greenberg 2018). In 2018, a water filtration plant experienced a cyber operation attributed to Russia, which was reportedly fended off. The operation employed the VPNFilter malware that targeted networking devices (Osborne 2018). Slowik (2018) indicates that the technical details are scarce, and the fact that the malware originally could only intercept traffic and not modify it indicates that this may have been intelligence gathering to prepare for a cyber operation against the plant, rather than being able to affect the integrity of the industrial systems in any way.\nUkraine has been described as a 'testing ground' for cyber operations: in addition to the widely reported Russian cyber operations, there are a multitude of cyber-espionage operations reported in Eastern Ukraine ostensibly collecting intelligence on the situation there (Cerulus 2019). The cyber operations described above exhibit a worrying trend, in that industrial controls systems could be targeted and could cause disruption to critical infrastructure; also of concern is the scale of the 'collateral damage' that NotPetya caused. Such cyber operations are clearly strategic and are intended to target civilian infrastructure, possibly to erode daily functioning of a country as well as the psychological resilience of the population. In this sense, cyber operations are being used, or at least attempted to being used, in a manner similar to strategic bombers of World War II, albeit with more precision and less physical destruction.\nPropaganda was a continuous feature surrounding the separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine, where the narratives echoed that of Russian and former Soviet propaganda, with some echoes of World War II. These narratives also indicate a type of extremist viewpoint, where the separatists portray themselves as heroically protecting their values, but are victims of overwhelming hostile adversaries: primarily Ukraine, supported by the majority of the world (Kostyuchenko &amp; Pushkar\nJournal of Information Warfare\n2022). During the COVID pandemic, the separatist groups spread conspiracy theories to erode confidence in the government measures and also suggested that the U.S. biolabs created the virus (Kostyuchenko et al. 2022). Doroshenko and Lukito (2021) illustrate that pro-Russian influence operations related to Ukraine are an evolution of the Cold War concept of reflexive control for the digital world. These operations engage with the audience in such a way that their decision making is favourable to the objectives of the perpetrator. In an attempt to counter influence operations and propaganda for war in the context of Ukraine, Richter (2015) contends that countries utilised their own local laws, whereas a set of international norms might have proven to be more effective. While little is reported of EW use during this period, Russian EW units have reportedly supported the separatists by distributing propaganda over cellular phone networks in addition to disrupting and detecting (for targeting purposes) Ukrainian communications (Clark 2022).\nWhile IW operations were not as intense in terms of the amount outside of major military operations (or less attention was being paid to the IW activities), they were still present. During this period some of the most notable cyber operations were conducted, namely NotPetya and the attacks against the electric grid, taking a step closer to what could potentially produce a blackout across major portions of a country. These operations appeared to be preparation for what was to come in 2022, which is covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Conflict\nDue to the amount of information available about the IW efforts in the 2022 conflict, this section will be divided to focus on specific areas; however, there may still be overlaps (for example cyber-enabled influence operations). Cyber operations are discussed first, followed by influence operations, and then a section on other notable IW activities during the conflict.\n## Cyber operations\nThe number of recorded cyber operations for the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict is notable; it is possible that there was more activity, but at the same time there was more attention to cyber operations during the conflict. The CyberPeace Institute (2022b) has an interactive portal dedicated to tracking cyber incidents during the conflict, and recorded 626 alleged incidents in 2022 related to the Ukraine conflict; this averages to nearly two incidents per day.\nIn January there were some wiper attacks, website defacements of government websites, and attempts to compromise government organisations. In February, incidents of cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, and disinformation were reported. Immediately preceding the invasion (23 February), more DDoS attacks, wipers, and ransomware were reported. During the initial stages of the Russian incursion into Ukraine (24-25 February), DDoS, wipers, phishing, social media-based disinformation, and website compromises were seen; the DDoS attacks and disinformation continued to late February, and in early March cyber operations targeted the media and communications sector, and malware targeted non-government organisations (CyberPeace Institute 2022b).\nFigure 1 illustrates the composition of the 626 cyber-operations recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), categorised into 10 incident types from January to October. As is evident from the figure, the majority of the incidents were DDoS, followed by hack and leak operations. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalent categories of 201 cyber incidents that targeted Ukraine; the 158 incidents that targeted Russia are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 illustrates the categories of 267 incidents\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nrelated to the conflict that targeted nations or organisations globally. DDoS attacks were the most prevalent type, targeting Ukraine and global targets, while hack and leak operations were the most prevalent against Russia.\nFigure 1: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 2: Types of cyber operations targeting Ukraine, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 3: Types of cyber operations targeting Russia, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 4: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict targeting the rest of the world, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of cyber incidents per month. Those targeting Ukraine began in January, increased in February, with an initial peak in March. Many of these may have been preparatory in nature, as with previous conflicts, to disrupt communication and disseminate disinformation in an attempt to dominate the information sphere during the early stages of the conflict. Those targeting Russia began in February, with an increase in March, and initial peak in April. These lagged the incidents against Ukraine by a month, and were probably retaliatory in nature. The incidents with global impact began in January, with a slight increase in February, peaking in April. However, the decline was slower than that of Russia and Ukraine. All areas experienced second peaks from August to October.\nFigure 5: Number of cyber operations targeting the belligerents (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 6 illustrates the number of incidents for each category per month. Due to the number of DDoS incidents, these are shown on a separate graph. The DDoS attacks peaked drastically in August and September, to an extent that they overshadowed some of the other categories. In January, wipers and defacement were most prevalent, with cyber espionage and wipers being the most prevalent in March and April. This speaks to how cyber operations are used by Russia. The use of volunteers for Ukraine is discussed in more detail later. A report by Microsoft concurred that most destructive attacks (for example, wipers) occurred in the first week of the conflict, and  $40\\%$  of the destructive attacks targeted critical infrastructure (Digital Security Unit 2022).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\n(b) DDoS and total\nFigure 6: Types of cyber operations per month (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFrom Figure 7, it is evident that hacking collectives are by far the most prevalent threat actor type, followed by nation-state actors. This further demonstrates the role of non-state actors in the cyber domain during the conflict. Of the 65 unique threat actors identified by the CyberPeace Institute, 38 were supporting Russia and 27 were supporting Ukraine. Two interesting threat actors supporting Russia originated from Brazil and Iraq (CyberPeace Institute 2022), which falls outside of the usual online belligerents related to the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The weighting towards the\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\ncollectives is not necessarily unusual; however, Ukraine did follow a strategy of openly calling for international cyber volunteers to support its cyber operations (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022). This, however, raises concerns that, while such volunteers and hacktivists are often seen during times of heightened political tension, their presence when there is an actual physical conflict could unintentionally involve countries that are essentially neutral, or the cyber volunteers could potentially be classified as mercenaries or combatants and open themselves (and the country they reside in) to retaliation. In addition to the volunteers, cybercriminal groups openly chose sides (Ilascu 2022). However, a ransomware gang that declared its support for Russia experienced leaks of information, thought to be Ukrainian members of the group retaliating; these leaks provided useful insights into the operations of ransomware groups (Pitrelli 2022).\nFigure 7: Types of threat actors (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 8 illustrates the types of cyber operations that each threat actor type was conducting. The collectives overwhelmingly favoured DDoS and hack and leak operations; nation state actors accounted for more cyber espionage, 'other' incidents, and wipers. Given the timing of the hack and leak operations shown in Figure 6(a), and the prevalence of hack and leak operations against Russia (Figure 3) and that they were committed by collectives, it can be deduced that these may have been volunteers targeting Russia in retaliation for the invasion and the for the support of cyber operations. Similarly, globally there were a number of DDoS attacks from August to October (Figure 6[a]), also conducted by collectives. These largely affected global targets, but also Ukraine and Russia. Some of these DDoS attacks could have grown out of frustration by pro-Russian groups of the waning support to Russia; for example, multiple websites of the Bulgarian Government were targeted for what the perpetrator claimed was the Bulgarian betrayal of Russia (Antoniuk 2022). A situation may have arisen where various hacking collectives began targeting countries as a series of reprisals; van Niekerk and Maharaj (2011) predicted this as a likely occurrence in a cyber conflict, based on a series of retaliatory cyber incidents in support of either Wikileaks or the U.S. government in 2010.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(b) DDoS and Total\nFigure 8: Types of incident per threat actor type (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nSome notable incidents include a cyber operation against a broadband satellite provider, Viasat, on 24 February (Page 2022; Urchill 2022). This illustrates a continuation of the practice of targeting media and communication platforms alongside the initial military operations. In addition to significant damage to the terminals at Viasat, the 'collateral damage' of the incident affected parts of Europe, including remote access to over 5000 wind turbines in Germany (Page 2022). A border control station between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly affected by a wiper malware on 25 February, slowing down the processing of Ukrainian refugees (Berger 2022). A number of cyber operations against industrial systems were reported: Belarusian hacktivist collectives claimed that they targeted railway systems to hinder Russian troop movements (Gallagher &amp; Bloomberg 2022); cyber operations (which ultimately failed) targeting power companies that included wiper malware as well as an updated version of the malware used to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 were found, (ESET Research 2022; Goodchild 2022). In addition, a Russian taxi operator was compromised and all taxis were instructed to go to the same location in Moscow, causing a traffic jam (Roth 2022). These attacks are outside of the usual website defacements and DDoS attacks that have traditionally been exhibited during times of conflict.\nObservers commented on the lack of visible cyber operations by Russia after the early stages of the conflict, as it was expected by some to have been much greater by several researchers (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022; Schneider 2022). By comparison, Russia appeared a much greater cyber power in relation to Ukraine: the National Cyber Power Index 2020 listed Russia as  $4^{\\text{th}}$  and Ukraine as  $26^{\\text{th}}$  of 30 countries (Voo et al. 2020); therefore, a strong presence by Russia in the cyber arena would have made sense. Proposed reasons for the quieter than expected cyber domain are that, in a physical conflict, kinetic weapons are more useful and cyber operations are more suited for deception and deniability, making them ideal for use outside of open conflict (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022). Urchill (2022) indicates that the attempts against the Ukrainian power grid indicate that cyber operations were active, which negates the growing narrative that they were quiet. The number of cyber incidents recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b) and illustrated by the figures above indicate that there was a significant amount\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof activity. While there were attacks on critical infrastructure, they did not succeed due to (at least in part) assistance that Ukraine received (Goodchild 2022; Landau 2022). In addition to the volunteers supporting Ukraine mentioned above, there was formal foreign assistance, including ‘hunt forward' operations by the U.S. Cyber Command (Janofsky 2022). The scope of the foreign assistance included forward deployments and remote assistance for cyber defence by both vendors and official personnel, the sharing of threat intelligence, and services provided to improve the resilience of Ukrainian systems, such as migrating to Cloud storage (Beecroft 2022; Martin 2022a; Martin 2022b).\nThe coordination of cyber operations with physical military operations by Russian forces is illustrated in general by the Microsoft report, where both physical and virtual attacks appear to drive at the same objective (Digital Security Unit 2022). Specific examples include the Viasat (a contractor for the Ukrainian military) incident, mentioned above, is a contractor for the Ukrainian military) and coordinated cyber and kinetic attacks against power companies (Petkauskas 2022). In addition, propaganda and information operations overlap with cyber operations, indicated by the cyber-enabled information operations in Figures 1 through 4, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. The cyber dimension has therefore played an important role in the conflict, although it did not achieve the full potential and the inherit limitations still preclude it from having a direct impact on the battlefield (van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk & Ramluckan 2022).\n## Psychological operations, disinformation, and influence campaigns\nInformation warfare in the cognitive domain is a key aspect of any conflict. Within the Rusian Ukraine war, there was a heavy cyber-enabled component to disinformation (including use of a deepfake and media manipulation), as well as some traditional PSYOP techniques. Immediately prior to and in the early days of the Russian invasion, disinformation was disseminated by SMS and social media, including the use of compromised social media accounts. In addition, the media and communication sectors were targeted by cyber operations (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In addition to affecting command and control, targeting such sectors reduced the amount of information that the government could provide to its citizens or to the outside world, in theory giving the Russian narrative more dominance.\nFacebook and Instagram accounts were used to spoof European news sites, publishing disinformation to over 60 websites; upon identifying the operation which began in May, Meta disabled the offending accounts. It was reported that this was the largest disinformation operation since the beginning of the conflict, and it used “an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force” (Gatlan 2022b). It was found that bots spreading disinformation against the U.S. reduced the amount of anti-vaccination content and increased pro-Russian content during the first months of the war; however, this effort did not gain traction (Wait 2022b). Over 300 disinformation sites related to the war were identified, and a number of narratives were shared including; a fighter pilot known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv' shooting down Russian aircraft, a deepfake of President Zelensky calling for surrender, U.S. bioweapons labs in Europe, videos of a President Putin in jail due to a coup, and examples of media manipulation to discredit Ukrainian government officials (Roache et al. 2022). In Hungary, traditional billboards were used to equate the sanctions against Russia to armed attacks and styling them as excessive (Tidey 2022). This is an example that ‘traditional' influence is still present, despite the move to the digital environment.\nCertain themes were again present, particularly accusations of Nazism. However, some claims had been taken too far, prompting President Putin to make an apology (Bella, Hendrix & Ilyushin 2022). However, the symbols painted on Russian military vehicles gained their own status, akin to the Nazi use of the swastika. The various symbols caused much speculation, but one in particular, ‘Z', has become a symbol for the Russian aggression and is seen as a pro-war symbol (Mackintosh 2022). This association has led some organisations to change their logos and some European countries to ban the public display of the symbol, although these moves have also been used to make claims of Russophobia (Tengjun 2022).\nA difference between 2014 and 2022 is that Ukraine had a fledgling government when Crimea was annexed it just having ousted the pro-Russian government; in 2022, the government was more stable and had years of experience dealing with disinformation and the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Zelensky's repeated presentations at national forums calling for assistance and sanctions aided in providing an almost unified front against Russia. The Ukrainian propaganda portraying heroism was particularly successful and the overall influence of the propaganda effort was key to keep the flow of funding and weapons as well as the sanctions in place (Meakin 2022). By contrast, the Russian propaganda effort appeared to be thinly disguised distraction and dismissal to Western audiences, often making false claims against Ukraine or the U.S. (such as that they were using dirty bombs or counter-accusations of war crimes), continuing the 4Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay) seen in previous iterations of the boarder conflict. While there was more international engagement, such as speeches by Minister Lavrov which were met by walkouts (Euronews 2022). However, the walkouts could be presented to the Russian population as evidence of a hostile West, and the speeches could be aimed at the Russian population rather than the immediate audience. The Russian internal-facing propaganda appeared to be somewhat effective, with many Russians not believing there was a war in Ukraine and then later believing that Russia could win (Dixon 2022).\n## Other areas of IW\nThis section focuses on the reports of intelligence and electronic warfare activities during the conflict. A notable aspect was proactive intelligence disclosures by the U.S. predicting the invasion and the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines (Beebe & Lieven 2022; Bertrand & Lillis 2022). The increasingly important role of open-source intelligence that was reinforced by the Russian invasion is highlighted by Wait (2022a), where valuable information could be obtained from the Internet and social media in particular, and collectives of investigative journalists were able to aid in providing attribution.\nFor EW, there were reports that flights from Estonia to Finland had to return due to GPS interference, which had also been detected along the Finland-Russian border (Gatlan 2022a). The Starlink satellite systems provided to Ukraine reportedly experienced jamming; however, it was claimed that this was resolved after a software update (Insinna 2022). Russian media reported that a NATO drone had been jammed over the Black Sea (Carbonaro 2022). While both sides have used EW, indications are that the Russian use has improved since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular its EW units are now learning to counter NATO equipment that has been supplied to Ukraine (Clark 2022; Demarest 2022). The Ukrainian government urged citizens to aid the military by disrupting Russian support units, with communications and EW units being emphasised as a target (Starr 2022); this may be an indication that the Russian EW was having an impact on the\nbattlefield. The EW in the conflict is being used to inform the U.S. military's planning; in addition, Russian EW equipment found abandoned will probably provide useful intelligence (Clark 2022; Demarest 2022).\n## Discussion\nFrom the descriptions above, IW has had an important role to play in the conflicts in Ukraine. While in some aspects there are new activities, others have remained constant or have shown gradual evolution.\nSome of the key differences from 2014 to 2022 include multinational support, both through organisations and official representation, that has aided Ukraine in the 2022 conflict. This extends beyond the financing and weapons delivery, but includes active support in the cyber domain, with foreign intelligence services admitting to conducting operations to bolster the defence of Ukraine's cyberspace. These include the deployment of forward-hunting operations to aid in disabling hostile cyberoperations; however, these will also prove useful in gathering intelligence on Russian cyber capabilities.\nThe use of wiper malware, being more destructive and targeting infrastructure, as well as hack and leak operations are new tactics in the cyber domain, even though the use of DDoS and website defacements were still prevalent. There appeared to be increased targeting of industrial systems, including satellite communications. While there were incidents between the two major stages of armed conflict, these may have been in preparation for a major military incursion into Ukraine. The number of attempts against Ukrainian power utilities, although largely foiled from causing widespread outages, indicates that this may have been part of a strategy to force the Ukrainian population into submission and to hasten a military conquest of the country. It is possible that there was an over-reliance on these aspects, and, when they failed, the troops on the ground met much stiffer resistance than expected.\nThe potential for increased cyber operations resulted in more attention to the environment, and active tracking of reported incidents by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), giving a detailed record of alleged incidents. This has given more insight into the use of cyber operations than during any prior political crisis or conflict. In addition, open calls by the Ukrainian government for a ‘volunteer cyber army' represented the first time a nation has publicly encouraged civilians to engage in hostile cyber activity against another nation on such a scale. This will have contributed to the increased cyber activity, but also raises several questions which, until that point, had been rhetorical: how would civilians engaging in cyber operations against a state during a time of armed conflict be classified, and what measure can be taken against them in order to protect critical systems?\nDisinformation and influence operations played a role from 2014 through 2022. A difference was that the current Ukrainian government had been in place when the conflict started, and had more experience dealing with influence campaigns than the government that had just taken office in 2014. This has shown in the way the Ukrainian government, led by President Zelensky, has engaged with other world leaders to solidify support for its war efforts.\nLeading up to the Russian invasion in 2022, unprecedented proactive intelligence disclosures were made warning of the impending invasion, and subsequently for the attacks on the Nordstream pipelines. However, similar attempts were made by Russia which were received as falsehoods in\nthat the same accusations were levelled against Russia. This may change the nature of intelligence sharing and make intelligence more open source.\nDespite some differences and new techniques and tactics, there are similarities from 2014 to 2022. Hacktivist involvement, website defacement, and DDoS attacks are ever-present factors. Cyber operations were coordinated with physical operations; however, there seems to be an evolution to include new targets and methods as discussed above. In both 2014 and 2022, observers commented that they thought cyber operations would play a larger role than what materialised; however, the number of cyber incidents has grown significantly. The prevailing theory, which is supported by evidence, is that cyber operations are more suitable for use outside of open armed conflict, and that what did occur in 2022 had limited military tactical benefit, as indicated by van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk, and Ramluckan (2022). The opposing view was that the heightened preparedness and international support blunted the impact of the initial aggressive cyber operations.\nIn the cognitive domain, similar narratives for disinformation and influence operations were prevalent, and similar tactics remained from 2014 through 2022. On the intelligence front, the role of open source intelligence, fuelled in part by social media remained; however, this is evolving to become more prevalent, as posited by van Niekerk (2015).\n## Conclusion\nInformation warfare has played a significant part in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, since the Maidan uprisings overthrowing the pro-Russian Ukrainian government, through the annexation of Crimea, the separatist movements in the East, up to and including the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict. This history provides a particularly useful case study to investigate how IW has evolved (and remained the same) over the eight-year period.\nSome new tactics, particularly in the cyber domain—such as wipers and infrastructure attacks—emerged in 2022 compared to 2014; however, between 2015 and 2017, these appeared to have been tested. International support aided in the Ukrainian war effort, including forward-hunting teams for cyber defence and proactive intelligence disclosures. Electronic warfare use appeared to remain constant throughout. Disinformation and influence operations also remained constant, as did some of the major narratives; however, in 2022, this was a more contested space, compared to 2014.\nWhile the future remains uncertain, cyber operations may not play a major role on the battlefield for the foreseeable future; however, the quantity and intensity of cyber operations due to conflict and particularly immediately preceding conflict may continue to grow, as is evidenced from what happened between 2014 and 2022. Similarly, disinformation and influence operations are likely to intensify with some evolution. Intelligence may show the largest evolution going forward, with more open releases and greater use of open sources, given the pervasive connectivity of devices and information posted on social media."

      "flat_text": "# The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nB van Niekerk\nDepartment of Information Technology\nDurban University of Technology\nDurban, South Africa\nEmail: brettv@dut.ac.za\nAbstract: In January 2022, Russian forces began building up on the Ukrainian border prior to entering Ukraine in what was termed a 'special military operation' in support of ethnic Russians. In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.\nKeywords: Cyber operations, Disinformation, Information Warfare, Intelligence Disclosures, Volunteer Cyber Army\n# Introduction\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered into Ukrainian sovereign territory in what was termed a 'special military operation'. This had followed weeks of the forces building up along the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus, which were claimed to be exercises with denials on any impending military action against Ukraine. The broader conflict began in 2014 after anti-government protests from late 2013 successfully ousted the pro-Russian government in Kyiv. The Russian annexation of Crimea occurred shortly thereafter, followed by a low-intensity conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Alongside these activities in the physical domain, the conflict was also occurring in the information domain.\nThere is no consistent approach to the concept of information warfare (IW), which has also undergone evolution over the last two decades. For the purposes of this article, IW is considered to be an encompassing concept of activities in the physical, logical, and cognitive domains that seek to impact or protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (van Niekerk 2015). Information warfare can be considered to be comprised of:\n- Cyber operations\n- Influence operations, disinformation, propaganda, and psychological operations\n- Electronic warfare\n- Intelligence\nJournal of Information Warfare (2023) 22.1: 10-31\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nThe article considers openly available reports of IW activity during the conflict in Ukraine to illustrate the evolution of tactics from 2014 up to and including 2022. The next section provides an overview of key IW activity in the 2014 crisis and annexation of Crimea. This is followed by the relevant activity between the main events of 2014 and 2022. The next section covers the IW activity during the 2022 conflict. Thereafter, a discussion to highlight the key evolutions of IW is conducted, and the article is then concluded.\n# Information Warfare in the 2014 Protests and the Annexation of Crimea\nThe use of IW in the 2014 Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea were discussed in-depth previously by the author (van Niekerk 2015). This section will provide a summary of key points from that chapter, which provides as a baseline against which the IW activities in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict can be benchmarked. The crisis in Ukraine began at the end of 2013 with protests against the pro-Russian government, during which social media played a role. In 2014, as the protests continued, security forces became violent, resulting in the protests intensifying and the situation escalating. Eventually the Ukrainian president fled to Russia, and a new government was installed by 23 February 2014. However, pro-Russian protests began, and social media was used to divide ethnic Russians by spreading fear, which the new government did not address. A week later, armed militia began seizing key points in Crimea, and, in early March, a video emerged of Russian-made military equipment entering Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied the forces were theirs, but by 16 March a referendum had been held, claiming that the majority of Crimeans wished to join Russia, completing the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Subsequently, pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine began seizing buildings and a period of low-intensity conflict began, during which the downing of MH17 occurred. The diplomatic response to these actions was the implementation and increasing sanctions on Russia, and Russia putting pressure on Ukraine to pay for gas supplies.\nThe protests in Ukraine were a useful case study, as they could be benchmarked against the Orange Revolution of 2004, prior to extensive use of social media in popular uprisings. This comparison illustrated that social media gave anti-government protestors and journalists a platform for mass-dissemination of information outside of the state-controlled traditional media, and that the protestors found this information more reliable than formal news platforms (Onuch 2014; Satell 2014). During the incursion in Crimea, Russian media made numerous claims which indicated chaos and mass defections in Ukraine, many of which were shown to be inaccurate; in addition, images began showing that the forces in Crimea were in fact Russian, as images of the same individuals were shown from the Russian incursion into Georgia in 2008 (van Niekerk 2015). A key perspective was provided by Kates and Butorin (2014), who indicated that the Russian media was providing a reality to their target audience, namely the Russian population, in order to maintain support, and this did not necessarily align with reality. This was generally successful as a majority of the Russian population trusted the Russian media, and the persistent rhetoric dominated over other sources provided an 'alternate' truth (Kates &amp; Butorin 2014). The use of pro-Russian 'trolls' to discredit social media and blog posters was reported, indicating attempts to dominate the narrative on social media and online (chornajuravka 2014).\nCyber operations were present prior to and during the annexation of Crimea, in particular cyber-espionage, distributed denial of service attacks, and website defacements. Cyber-espionage campaigns were present well before the crisis in 2013/2014, with a number of campaigns targeting Ukraine and other nations within the Russian sphere of influence and with another cyber-espionage\nJournal of Information Warfare\ncampaign predominantly targeting Ukraine in 2013 and 2014 (van Niekerk 2015). One particular cyber-espionage campaign of 2013 bears specific mention in that the lure was fake Ukrainian foreign policy documents purporting to show Ukraine's plans to seek NATO membership (Mimoso 2013). As the narratives giving rise to the tensions in 2014, and as discussed later in 2022, this theme becomes core. Webpage defacements had begun in early November 2013, pre-dating the protests; however, the themes are worth recognition in the context of this article: the defacement of Ukrainian government websites and the distribution of false emails both contained a message claiming to be from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Kovacs 2013). During the initial stages of armed incursion in Crimea, webpage defacements targeting the Russian government and organisations routinely used the term ‘Nazi” (van Niekerk 2015).\nThe most common cyber incident was DDoS attacks. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was targeted in retaliation for the alleged hacks mentioned above (Kovacs 2013). A notable tactic was the use of DDoS attacks in conjunction with physical attacks against the communication infrastructure during the early stages of the armed incursion into Crimea, which disrupted the Ukrainian forces' based in Crimea ability to communicate; in addition, mobile phones of the Ukrainian parliament were disrupted (Vamosi 2014). This tactic was seen previously in the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The DDoS attacks also became prevalent prior to the scheduled Crimean referendum to join Russia—although the majority of DDoS incidents were claimed by hacktivist groups (van Niekerk 2015). Commentary on the cyber incidents surrounding the Ukrainian political crisis and the annexation of Crimea indicated surprise about the limited and constrained use of cyber operations by Russia, with suggestions that the Ukrainian hackers were more skilled and could mount stronger retaliations (Clayton 2014a; Gady 2014).\nIn May 2014, there was an attempt to disrupt and interfere with the Ukrainian 2014 presidential election. Clayton (2014b) indicates attempts were made to delete data, leak information, alter the voting totals (with the use of malware), and then disrupt access with a DDoS attack. The attack was attributed to a pro-Russian hacktivist group; however, this has been refuted (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). A disinformation operation was coordinated with the attempt to alter voting data, as a Russian news channel incorrectly reported a win of the pro-Russian candidate with the same voting percentages that the above-mentioned malware attempted to insert into the voting platform. This implies a concerted effort to use cyber operations and disinformation to ‘hijack' the election in a way that aligned with the Russian propaganda narrative (Clayton 2014b).\nThe use of electronic warfare appeared limited, with only a single report, which claimed that Russian satellite television had been jammed (Rehle 2014). From an intelligence perspective, social media proved to be useful for open source intelligence; where videos of troop movements appeared, selfies aided in identifying possible Russian troops and aided in attribution for the downing of flight MH17 (van Niekerk 2015).\nIn summary, the IW activities in 2014 began exhibiting boarder coordination amongst cyber operations, the propaganda effort, and physical operations on the ground. The IW operations did not stop, but a few notable incidents occurred between the major events of 2014 and 2022, which will be covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the ‘Inter-War' Period\nBetween the main events of 2014, as described above, and the direct military conflict in 2022\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(discussed in the next section), a number of information warfare activities occurred that were notable. Of key interest are a series of cyber operations which demonstrated the potential for significant impact and disruption through cyber means, and some foreshadowed other similar events that occurred subsequently.\nIn December of both 2015 and 2016, malware impacted parts of the Ukrainian electricity grid, resulting in a loss of power to the areas serviced by the affected substations. In 2015, 16 substations were affected, disrupting the electricity supply for up to six hours for over 200,000 customers. This malware was attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Sandworm (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In 2016 another APT, known as Electrum with reported links to the Sandworm APT, caused a shorter disruption, which affected about a fifth of Kyiv's supply. However, the functionality of the malware indicated the potential for causing broader cascading effects across the power grid (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Dragos 2017). In October 2016 it was reported that a Ukrainian hacktivist group had conducted a 'hack and leak' operation against a senior Russian official's emails, which provided evidence that Russia was involved in the 2014 separatist movements (Kramer 2016).\nIn June 2017, a modified version of the Petya ransomware appeared to target Ukrainian organisations, but then rapidly spread globally in what is the most expensive cyber incident recorded. The malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability, used by the WannaCry ransomware worm the month before, but it was also modified so the encryption was irreversible, resulting in it being renamed NotPetya and reclassified as a wiper. While NotPetya was known for its global financial impact that exceeded 10 billion USD and disrupted shipping company Maersk, it impacted a number of Ukrainian organisations, including radiation monitoring at Chernobyl (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Greenberg 2018). In 2018, a water filtration plant experienced a cyber operation attributed to Russia, which was reportedly fended off. The operation employed the VPNFilter malware that targeted networking devices (Osborne 2018). Slowik (2018) indicates that the technical details are scarce, and the fact that the malware originally could only intercept traffic and not modify it indicates that this may have been intelligence gathering to prepare for a cyber operation against the plant, rather than being able to affect the integrity of the industrial systems in any way.\nUkraine has been described as a 'testing ground' for cyber operations: in addition to the widely reported Russian cyber operations, there are a multitude of cyber-espionage operations reported in Eastern Ukraine ostensibly collecting intelligence on the situation there (Cerulus 2019). The cyber operations described above exhibit a worrying trend, in that industrial controls systems could be targeted and could cause disruption to critical infrastructure; also of concern is the scale of the 'collateral damage' that NotPetya caused. Such cyber operations are clearly strategic and are intended to target civilian infrastructure, possibly to erode daily functioning of a country as well as the psychological resilience of the population. In this sense, cyber operations are being used, or at least attempted to being used, in a manner similar to strategic bombers of World War II, albeit with more precision and less physical destruction.\nPropaganda was a continuous feature surrounding the separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine, where the narratives echoed that of Russian and former Soviet propaganda, with some echoes of World War II. These narratives also indicate a type of extremist viewpoint, where the separatists portray themselves as heroically protecting their values, but are victims of overwhelming hostile adversaries: primarily Ukraine, supported by the majority of the world (Kostyuchenko &amp; Pushkar\nJournal of Information Warfare\n2022). During the COVID pandemic, the separatist groups spread conspiracy theories to erode confidence in the government measures and also suggested that the U.S. biolabs created the virus (Kostyuchenko et al. 2022). Doroshenko and Lukito (2021) illustrate that pro-Russian influence operations related to Ukraine are an evolution of the Cold War concept of reflexive control for the digital world. These operations engage with the audience in such a way that their decision making is favourable to the objectives of the perpetrator. In an attempt to counter influence operations and propaganda for war in the context of Ukraine, Richter (2015) contends that countries utilised their own local laws, whereas a set of international norms might have proven to be more effective. While little is reported of EW use during this period, Russian EW units have reportedly supported the separatists by distributing propaganda over cellular phone networks in addition to disrupting and detecting (for targeting purposes) Ukrainian communications (Clark 2022).\nWhile IW operations were not as intense in terms of the amount outside of major military operations (or less attention was being paid to the IW activities), they were still present. During this period some of the most notable cyber operations were conducted, namely NotPetya and the attacks against the electric grid, taking a step closer to what could potentially produce a blackout across major portions of a country. These operations appeared to be preparation for what was to come in 2022, which is covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Conflict\nDue to the amount of information available about the IW efforts in the 2022 conflict, this section will be divided to focus on specific areas; however, there may still be overlaps (for example cyber-enabled influence operations). Cyber operations are discussed first, followed by influence operations, and then a section on other notable IW activities during the conflict.\n## Cyber operations\nThe number of recorded cyber operations for the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict is notable; it is possible that there was more activity, but at the same time there was more attention to cyber operations during the conflict. The CyberPeace Institute (2022b) has an interactive portal dedicated to tracking cyber incidents during the conflict, and recorded 626 alleged incidents in 2022 related to the Ukraine conflict; this averages to nearly two incidents per day.\nIn January there were some wiper attacks, website defacements of government websites, and attempts to compromise government organisations. In February, incidents of cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, and disinformation were reported. Immediately preceding the invasion (23 February), more DDoS attacks, wipers, and ransomware were reported. During the initial stages of the Russian incursion into Ukraine (24-25 February), DDoS, wipers, phishing, social media-based disinformation, and website compromises were seen; the DDoS attacks and disinformation continued to late February, and in early March cyber operations targeted the media and communications sector, and malware targeted non-government organisations (CyberPeace Institute 2022b).\nFigure 1 illustrates the composition of the 626 cyber-operations recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), categorised into 10 incident types from January to October. As is evident from the figure, the majority of the incidents were DDoS, followed by hack and leak operations. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalent categories of 201 cyber incidents that targeted Ukraine; the 158 incidents that targeted Russia are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 illustrates the categories of 267 incidents\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nrelated to the conflict that targeted nations or organisations globally. DDoS attacks were the most prevalent type, targeting Ukraine and global targets, while hack and leak operations were the most prevalent against Russia.\nFigure 1: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 2: Types of cyber operations targeting Ukraine, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 3: Types of cyber operations targeting Russia, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 4: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict targeting the rest of the world, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of cyber incidents per month. Those targeting Ukraine began in January, increased in February, with an initial peak in March. Many of these may have been preparatory in nature, as with previous conflicts, to disrupt communication and disseminate disinformation in an attempt to dominate the information sphere during the early stages of the conflict. Those targeting Russia began in February, with an increase in March, and initial peak in April. These lagged the incidents against Ukraine by a month, and were probably retaliatory in nature. The incidents with global impact began in January, with a slight increase in February, peaking in April. However, the decline was slower than that of Russia and Ukraine. All areas experienced second peaks from August to October.\nFigure 5: Number of cyber operations targeting the belligerents (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 6 illustrates the number of incidents for each category per month. Due to the number of DDoS incidents, these are shown on a separate graph. The DDoS attacks peaked drastically in August and September, to an extent that they overshadowed some of the other categories. In January, wipers and defacement were most prevalent, with cyber espionage and wipers being the most prevalent in March and April. This speaks to how cyber operations are used by Russia. The use of volunteers for Ukraine is discussed in more detail later. A report by Microsoft concurred that most destructive attacks (for example, wipers) occurred in the first week of the conflict, and  $40\\%$  of the destructive attacks targeted critical infrastructure (Digital Security Unit 2022).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\n(b) DDoS and total\nFigure 6: Types of cyber operations per month (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFrom Figure 7, it is evident that hacking collectives are by far the most prevalent threat actor type, followed by nation-state actors. This further demonstrates the role of non-state actors in the cyber domain during the conflict. Of the 65 unique threat actors identified by the CyberPeace Institute, 38 were supporting Russia and 27 were supporting Ukraine. Two interesting threat actors supporting Russia originated from Brazil and Iraq (CyberPeace Institute 2022), which falls outside of the usual online belligerents related to the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The weighting towards the\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\ncollectives is not necessarily unusual; however, Ukraine did follow a strategy of openly calling for international cyber volunteers to support its cyber operations (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022). This, however, raises concerns that, while such volunteers and hacktivists are often seen during times of heightened political tension, their presence when there is an actual physical conflict could unintentionally involve countries that are essentially neutral, or the cyber volunteers could potentially be classified as mercenaries or combatants and open themselves (and the country they reside in) to retaliation. In addition to the volunteers, cybercriminal groups openly chose sides (Ilascu 2022). However, a ransomware gang that declared its support for Russia experienced leaks of information, thought to be Ukrainian members of the group retaliating; these leaks provided useful insights into the operations of ransomware groups (Pitrelli 2022).\nFigure 7: Types of threat actors (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 8 illustrates the types of cyber operations that each threat actor type was conducting. The collectives overwhelmingly favoured DDoS and hack and leak operations; nation state actors accounted for more cyber espionage, 'other' incidents, and wipers. Given the timing of the hack and leak operations shown in Figure 6(a), and the prevalence of hack and leak operations against Russia (Figure 3) and that they were committed by collectives, it can be deduced that these may have been volunteers targeting Russia in retaliation for the invasion and the for the support of cyber operations. Similarly, globally there were a number of DDoS attacks from August to October (Figure 6[a]), also conducted by collectives. These largely affected global targets, but also Ukraine and Russia. Some of these DDoS attacks could have grown out of frustration by pro-Russian groups of the waning support to Russia; for example, multiple websites of the Bulgarian Government were targeted for what the perpetrator claimed was the Bulgarian betrayal of Russia (Antoniuk 2022). A situation may have arisen where various hacking collectives began targeting countries as a series of reprisals; van Niekerk and Maharaj (2011) predicted this as a likely occurrence in a cyber conflict, based on a series of retaliatory cyber incidents in support of either Wikileaks or the U.S. government in 2010.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(b) DDoS and Total\nFigure 8: Types of incident per threat actor type (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nSome notable incidents include a cyber operation against a broadband satellite provider, Viasat, on 24 February (Page 2022; Urchill 2022). This illustrates a continuation of the practice of targeting media and communication platforms alongside the initial military operations. In addition to significant damage to the terminals at Viasat, the 'collateral damage' of the incident affected parts of Europe, including remote access to over 5000 wind turbines in Germany (Page 2022). A border control station between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly affected by a wiper malware on 25 February, slowing down the processing of Ukrainian refugees (Berger 2022). A number of cyber operations against industrial systems were reported: Belarusian hacktivist collectives claimed that they targeted railway systems to hinder Russian troop movements (Gallagher &amp; Bloomberg 2022); cyber operations (which ultimately failed) targeting power companies that included wiper malware as well as an updated version of the malware used to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 were found, (ESET Research 2022; Goodchild 2022). In addition, a Russian taxi operator was compromised and all taxis were instructed to go to the same location in Moscow, causing a traffic jam (Roth 2022). These attacks are outside of the usual website defacements and DDoS attacks that have traditionally been exhibited during times of conflict.\nObservers commented on the lack of visible cyber operations by Russia after the early stages of the conflict, as it was expected by some to have been much greater by several researchers (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022; Schneider 2022). By comparison, Russia appeared a much greater cyber power in relation to Ukraine: the National Cyber Power Index 2020 listed Russia as  $4^{\\text{th}}$  and Ukraine as  $26^{\\text{th}}$  of 30 countries (Voo et al. 2020); therefore, a strong presence by Russia in the cyber arena would have made sense. Proposed reasons for the quieter than expected cyber domain are that, in a physical conflict, kinetic weapons are more useful and cyber operations are more suited for deception and deniability, making them ideal for use outside of open conflict (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022). Urchill (2022) indicates that the attempts against the Ukrainian power grid indicate that cyber operations were active, which negates the growing narrative that they were quiet. The number of cyber incidents recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b) and illustrated by the figures above indicate that there was a significant amount\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof activity. While there were attacks on critical infrastructure, they did not succeed due to (at least in part) assistance that Ukraine received (Goodchild 2022; Landau 2022). In addition to the volunteers supporting Ukraine mentioned above, there was formal foreign assistance, including ‘hunt forward' operations by the U.S. Cyber Command (Janofsky 2022). The scope of the foreign assistance included forward deployments and remote assistance for cyber defence by both vendors and official personnel, the sharing of threat intelligence, and services provided to improve the resilience of Ukrainian systems, such as migrating to Cloud storage (Beecroft 2022; Martin 2022a; Martin 2022b).\nThe coordination of cyber operations with physical military operations by Russian forces is illustrated in general by the Microsoft report, where both physical and virtual attacks appear to drive at the same objective (Digital Security Unit 2022). Specific examples include the Viasat (a contractor for the Ukrainian military) incident, mentioned above, is a contractor for the Ukrainian military) and coordinated cyber and kinetic attacks against power companies (Petkauskas 2022). In addition, propaganda and information operations overlap with cyber operations, indicated by the cyber-enabled information operations in Figures 1 through 4, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. The cyber dimension has therefore played an important role in the conflict, although it did not achieve the full potential and the inherit limitations still preclude it from having a direct impact on the battlefield (van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk & Ramluckan 2022).\n## Psychological operations, disinformation, and influence campaigns\nInformation warfare in the cognitive domain is a key aspect of any conflict. Within the Rusian Ukraine war, there was a heavy cyber-enabled component to disinformation (including use of a deepfake and media manipulation), as well as some traditional PSYOP techniques. Immediately prior to and in the early days of the Russian invasion, disinformation was disseminated by SMS and social media, including the use of compromised social media accounts. In addition, the media and communication sectors were targeted by cyber operations (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In addition to affecting command and control, targeting such sectors reduced the amount of information that the government could provide to its citizens or to the outside world, in theory giving the Russian narrative more dominance.\nFacebook and Instagram accounts were used to spoof European news sites, publishing disinformation to over 60 websites; upon identifying the operation which began in May, Meta disabled the offending accounts. It was reported that this was the largest disinformation operation since the beginning of the conflict, and it used “an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force” (Gatlan 2022b). It was found that bots spreading disinformation against the U.S. reduced the amount of anti-vaccination content and increased pro-Russian content during the first months of the war; however, this effort did not gain traction (Wait 2022b). Over 300 disinformation sites related to the war were identified, and a number of narratives were shared including; a fighter pilot known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv' shooting down Russian aircraft, a deepfake of President Zelensky calling for surrender, U.S. bioweapons labs in Europe, videos of a President Putin in jail due to a coup, and examples of media manipulation to discredit Ukrainian government officials (Roache et al. 2022). In Hungary, traditional billboards were used to equate the sanctions against Russia to armed attacks and styling them as excessive (Tidey 2022). This is an example that ‘traditional' influence is still present, despite the move to the digital environment.\nCertain themes were again present, particularly accusations of Nazism. However, some claims had been taken too far, prompting President Putin to make an apology (Bella, Hendrix & Ilyushin 2022). However, the symbols painted on Russian military vehicles gained their own status, akin to the Nazi use of the swastika. The various symbols caused much speculation, but one in particular, ‘Z', has become a symbol for the Russian aggression and is seen as a pro-war symbol (Mackintosh 2022). This association has led some organisations to change their logos and some European countries to ban the public display of the symbol, although these moves have also been used to make claims of Russophobia (Tengjun 2022).\nA difference between 2014 and 2022 is that Ukraine had a fledgling government when Crimea was annexed it just having ousted the pro-Russian government; in 2022, the government was more stable and had years of experience dealing with disinformation and the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Zelensky's repeated presentations at national forums calling for assistance and sanctions aided in providing an almost unified front against Russia. The Ukrainian propaganda portraying heroism was particularly successful and the overall influence of the propaganda effort was key to keep the flow of funding and weapons as well as the sanctions in place (Meakin 2022). By contrast, the Russian propaganda effort appeared to be thinly disguised distraction and dismissal to Western audiences, often making false claims against Ukraine or the U.S. (such as that they were using dirty bombs or counter-accusations of war crimes), continuing the 4Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay) seen in previous iterations of the boarder conflict. While there was more international engagement, such as speeches by Minister Lavrov which were met by walkouts (Euronews 2022). However, the walkouts could be presented to the Russian population as evidence of a hostile West, and the speeches could be aimed at the Russian population rather than the immediate audience. The Russian internal-facing propaganda appeared to be somewhat effective, with many Russians not believing there was a war in Ukraine and then later believing that Russia could win (Dixon 2022).\n## Other areas of IW\nThis section focuses on the reports of intelligence and electronic warfare activities during the conflict. A notable aspect was proactive intelligence disclosures by the U.S. predicting the invasion and the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines (Beebe & Lieven 2022; Bertrand & Lillis 2022). The increasingly important role of open-source intelligence that was reinforced by the Russian invasion is highlighted by Wait (2022a), where valuable information could be obtained from the Internet and social media in particular, and collectives of investigative journalists were able to aid in providing attribution.\nFor EW, there were reports that flights from Estonia to Finland had to return due to GPS interference, which had also been detected along the Finland-Russian border (Gatlan 2022a). The Starlink satellite systems provided to Ukraine reportedly experienced jamming; however, it was claimed that this was resolved after a software update (Insinna 2022). Russian media reported that a NATO drone had been jammed over the Black Sea (Carbonaro 2022). While both sides have used EW, indications are that the Russian use has improved since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular its EW units are now learning to counter NATO equipment that has been supplied to Ukraine (Clark 2022; Demarest 2022). The Ukrainian government urged citizens to aid the military by disrupting Russian support units, with communications and EW units being emphasised as a target (Starr 2022); this may be an indication that the Russian EW was having an impact on the\nbattlefield. The EW in the conflict is being used to inform the U.S. military's planning; in addition, Russian EW equipment found abandoned will probably provide useful intelligence (Clark 2022; Demarest 2022).\n## Discussion\nFrom the descriptions above, IW has had an important role to play in the conflicts in Ukraine. While in some aspects there are new activities, others have remained constant or have shown gradual evolution.\nSome of the key differences from 2014 to 2022 include multinational support, both through organisations and official representation, that has aided Ukraine in the 2022 conflict. This extends beyond the financing and weapons delivery, but includes active support in the cyber domain, with foreign intelligence services admitting to conducting operations to bolster the defence of Ukraine's cyberspace. These include the deployment of forward-hunting operations to aid in disabling hostile cyberoperations; however, these will also prove useful in gathering intelligence on Russian cyber capabilities.\nThe use of wiper malware, being more destructive and targeting infrastructure, as well as hack and leak operations are new tactics in the cyber domain, even though the use of DDoS and website defacements were still prevalent. There appeared to be increased targeting of industrial systems, including satellite communications. While there were incidents between the two major stages of armed conflict, these may have been in preparation for a major military incursion into Ukraine. The number of attempts against Ukrainian power utilities, although largely foiled from causing widespread outages, indicates that this may have been part of a strategy to force the Ukrainian population into submission and to hasten a military conquest of the country. It is possible that there was an over-reliance on these aspects, and, when they failed, the troops on the ground met much stiffer resistance than expected.\nThe potential for increased cyber operations resulted in more attention to the environment, and active tracking of reported incidents by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), giving a detailed record of alleged incidents. This has given more insight into the use of cyber operations than during any prior political crisis or conflict. In addition, open calls by the Ukrainian government for a ‘volunteer cyber army' represented the first time a nation has publicly encouraged civilians to engage in hostile cyber activity against another nation on such a scale. This will have contributed to the increased cyber activity, but also raises several questions which, until that point, had been rhetorical: how would civilians engaging in cyber operations against a state during a time of armed conflict be classified, and what measure can be taken against them in order to protect critical systems?\nDisinformation and influence operations played a role from 2014 through 2022. A difference was that the current Ukrainian government had been in place when the conflict started, and had more experience dealing with influence campaigns than the government that had just taken office in 2014. This has shown in the way the Ukrainian government, led by President Zelensky, has engaged with other world leaders to solidify support for its war efforts.\nLeading up to the Russian invasion in 2022, unprecedented proactive intelligence disclosures were made warning of the impending invasion, and subsequently for the attacks on the Nordstream pipelines. However, similar attempts were made by Russia which were received as falsehoods in\nthat the same accusations were levelled against Russia. This may change the nature of intelligence sharing and make intelligence more open source.\nDespite some differences and new techniques and tactics, there are similarities from 2014 to 2022. Hacktivist involvement, website defacement, and DDoS attacks are ever-present factors. Cyber operations were coordinated with physical operations; however, there seems to be an evolution to include new targets and methods as discussed above. In both 2014 and 2022, observers commented that they thought cyber operations would play a larger role than what materialised; however, the number of cyber incidents has grown significantly. The prevailing theory, which is supported by evidence, is that cyber operations are more suitable for use outside of open armed conflict, and that what did occur in 2022 had limited military tactical benefit, as indicated by van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk, and Ramluckan (2022). The opposing view was that the heightened preparedness and international support blunted the impact of the initial aggressive cyber operations.\nIn the cognitive domain, similar narratives for disinformation and influence operations were prevalent, and similar tactics remained from 2014 through 2022. On the intelligence front, the role of open source intelligence, fuelled in part by social media remained; however, this is evolving to become more prevalent, as posited by van Niekerk (2015).\n## Conclusion\nInformation warfare has played a significant part in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, since the Maidan uprisings overthrowing the pro-Russian Ukrainian government, through the annexation of Crimea, the separatist movements in the East, up to and including the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict. This history provides a particularly useful case study to investigate how IW has evolved (and remained the same) over the eight-year period.\nSome new tactics, particularly in the cyber domain—such as wipers and infrastructure attacks—emerged in 2022 compared to 2014; however, between 2015 and 2017, these appeared to have been tested. International support aided in the Ukrainian war effort, including forward-hunting teams for cyber defence and proactive intelligence disclosures. Electronic warfare use appeared to remain constant throughout. Disinformation and influence operations also remained constant, as did some of the major narratives; however, in 2022, this was a more contested space, compared to 2014.\nWhile the future remains uncertain, cyber operations may not play a major role on the battlefield for the foreseeable future; however, the quantity and intensity of cyber operations due to conflict and particularly immediately preceding conflict may continue to grow, as is evidenced from what happened between 2014 and 2022. Similarly, disinformation and influence operations are likely to intensify with some evolution. Intelligence may show the largest evolution going forward, with more open releases and greater use of open sources, given the pervasive connectivity of devices and information posted on social media."

In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.\nKeywords: Cyber operations, Disinformation, Information Warfare, Intelligence Disclosures, Volunteer Cyber Army\n# Introduction\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered into Ukrainian sovereign territory in what was termed a 'special military operation'. This had followed weeks of the forces building up along the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus, which were claimed to be exercises with denials on any impending military action against Ukraine. The broader conflict began in 2014 after anti-government protests from late 2013 successfully ousted the pro-Russian government in Kyiv. The Russian annexation of Crimea occurred shortly thereafter, followed by a low-intensity conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Alongside these activities in the physical domain, the conflict was also occurring in the information domain.\nThere is no consistent approach to the concept of information warfare (IW), which has also undergone evolution over the last two decades. For the purposes of this article, IW is considered to be an encompassing concept of activities in the physical, logical, and cognitive domains that seek to impact or protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (van Niekerk 2015). Information warfare can be considered to be comprised of:\n- Cyber operations\n- Influence operations, disinformation, propaganda, and psychological operations\n- Electronic warfare\n- Intelligence\nJournal of Information Warfare (2023) 22.1: 10-31\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nThe article considers openly available reports of IW activity during the conflict in Ukraine to illustrate the evolution of tactics from 2014 up to and including 2022. The next section provides an overview of key IW activity in the 2014 crisis and annexation of Crimea. This is followed by the relevant activity between the main events of 2014 and 2022. The next section covers the IW activity during the 2022 conflict. Thereafter, a discussion to highlight the key evolutions of IW is conducted, and the article is then concluded.\n# Information Warfare in the 2014 Protests and the Annexation of Crimea\nThe use of IW in the 2014 Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea were discussed in-depth previously by the author (van Niekerk 2015). This section will provide a summary of key points from that chapter, which provides as a baseline against which the IW activities in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict can be benchmarked. The crisis in Ukraine began at the end of 2013 with protests against the pro-Russian government, during which social media played a role. In 2014, as the protests continued, security forces became violent, resulting in the protests intensifying and the situation escalating. Eventually the Ukrainian president fled to Russia, and a new government was installed by 23 February 2014. However, pro-Russian protests began, and social media was used to divide ethnic Russians by spreading fear, which the new government did not address. A week later, armed militia began seizing key points in Crimea, and, in early March, a video emerged of Russian-made military equipment entering Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied the forces were theirs, but by 16 March a referendum had been held, claiming that the majority of Crimeans wished to join Russia, completing the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Subsequently, pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine began seizing buildings and a period of low-intensity conflict began, during which the downing of MH17 occurred. The diplomatic response to these actions was the implementation and increasing sanctions on Russia, and Russia putting pressure on Ukraine to pay for gas supplies.\nThe protests in Ukraine were a useful case study, as they could be benchmarked against the Orange Revolution of 2004, prior to extensive use of social media in popular uprisings. This comparison illustrated that social media gave anti-government protestors and journalists a platform for mass-dissemination of information outside of the state-controlled traditional media, and that the protestors found this information more reliable than formal news platforms . During the incursion in Crimea, Russian media made numerous claims which indicated chaos and mass defections in Ukraine, many of which were shown to be inaccurate; in addition, images began showing that the forces in Crimea were in fact Russian, as images of the same individuals were shown from the Russian incursion into Georgia in 2008 (van Niekerk 2015). A key perspective was provided by Kates and Butorin (2014), who indicated that the Russian media was providing a reality to their target audience, namely the Russian population, in order to maintain support, and this did not necessarily align with reality. This was generally successful as a majority of the Russian population trusted the Russian media, and the persistent rhetoric dominated over other sources provided an 'alternate' truth (Kates &amp; Butorin 2014). The use of pro-Russian 'trolls' to discredit social media and blog posters was reported, indicating attempts to dominate the narrative on social media and online (chornajuravka 2014).\nCyber operations were present prior to and during the annexation of Crimea, in particular cyber-espionage, distributed denial of service attacks, and website defacements. Cyber-espionage campaigns were present well before the crisis in 2013/2014, with a number of campaigns targeting Ukraine and other nations within the Russian sphere of influence and with another cyber-espionage\nJournal of Information Warfare\ncampaign predominantly targeting Ukraine in 2013 and 2014 (van Niekerk 2015). One particular cyber-espionage campaign of 2013 bears specific mention in that the lure was fake Ukrainian foreign policy documents purporting to show Ukraine's plans to seek NATO membership . As the narratives giving rise to the tensions in 2014, and as discussed later in 2022, this theme becomes core. Webpage defacements had begun in early November 2013, pre-dating the protests; however, the themes are worth recognition in the context of this article: the defacement of Ukrainian government websites and the distribution of false emails both contained a message claiming to be from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence . During the initial stages of armed incursion in Crimea, webpage defacements targeting the Russian government and organisations routinely used the term ‘Nazi” (van Niekerk 2015).\nThe most common cyber incident was DDoS attacks. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was targeted in retaliation for the alleged hacks mentioned above . A notable tactic was the use of DDoS attacks in conjunction with physical attacks against the communication infrastructure during the early stages of the armed incursion into Crimea, which disrupted the Ukrainian forces' based in Crimea ability to communicate; in addition, mobile phones of the Ukrainian parliament were disrupted . This tactic was seen previously in the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The DDoS attacks also became prevalent prior to the scheduled Crimean referendum to join Russia—although the majority of DDoS incidents were claimed by hacktivist groups (van Niekerk 2015). Commentary on the cyber incidents surrounding the Ukrainian political crisis and the annexation of Crimea indicated surprise about the limited and constrained use of cyber operations by Russia, with suggestions that the Ukrainian hackers were more skilled and could mount stronger retaliations .\nIn May 2014, there was an attempt to disrupt and interfere with the Ukrainian 2014 presidential election. Clayton (2014b) indicates attempts were made to delete data, leak information, alter the voting totals (with the use of malware), and then disrupt access with a DDoS attack. The attack was attributed to a pro-Russian hacktivist group; however, this has been refuted (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). A disinformation operation was coordinated with the attempt to alter voting data, as a Russian news channel incorrectly reported a win of the pro-Russian candidate with the same voting percentages that the above-mentioned malware attempted to insert into the voting platform. This implies a concerted effort to use cyber operations and disinformation to ‘hijack' the election in a way that aligned with the Russian propaganda narrative .\nThe use of electronic warfare appeared limited, with only a single report, which claimed that Russian satellite television had been jammed . From an intelligence perspective, social media proved to be useful for open source intelligence; where videos of troop movements appeared, selfies aided in identifying possible Russian troops and aided in attribution for the downing of flight MH17 (van Niekerk 2015).\nIn summary, the IW activities in 2014 began exhibiting boarder coordination amongst cyber operations, the propaganda effort, and physical operations on the ground. The IW operations did not stop, but a few notable incidents occurred between the major events of 2014 and 2022, which will be covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the ‘Inter-War' Period\nBetween the main events of 2014, as described above, and the direct military conflict in 2022\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(discussed in the next section), a number of information warfare activities occurred that were notable. Of key interest are a series of cyber operations which demonstrated the potential for significant impact and disruption through cyber means, and some foreshadowed other similar events that occurred subsequently.\nIn December of both 2015 and 2016, malware impacted parts of the Ukrainian electricity grid, resulting in a loss of power to the areas serviced by the affected substations. In 2015, 16 substations were affected, disrupting the electricity supply for up to six hours for over 200,000 customers. This malware was attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Sandworm (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In 2016 another APT, known as Electrum with reported links to the Sandworm APT, caused a shorter disruption, which affected about a fifth of Kyiv's supply. However, the functionality of the malware indicated the potential for causing broader cascading effects across the power grid (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Dragos 2017). In October 2016 it was reported that a Ukrainian hacktivist group had conducted a 'hack and leak' operation against a senior Russian official's emails, which provided evidence that Russia was involved in the 2014 separatist movements .\nIn June 2017, a modified version of the Petya ransomware appeared to target Ukrainian organisations, but then rapidly spread globally in what is the most expensive cyber incident recorded. The malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability, used by the WannaCry ransomware worm the month before, but it was also modified so the encryption was irreversible, resulting in it being renamed NotPetya and reclassified as a wiper. While NotPetya was known for its global financial impact that exceeded 10 billion USD and disrupted shipping company Maersk, it impacted a number of Ukrainian organisations, including radiation monitoring at Chernobyl (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Greenberg 2018). In 2018, a water filtration plant experienced a cyber operation attributed to Russia, which was reportedly fended off. The operation employed the VPNFilter malware that targeted networking devices . Slowik (2018) indicates that the technical details are scarce, and the fact that the malware originally could only intercept traffic and not modify it indicates that this may have been intelligence gathering to prepare for a cyber operation against the plant, rather than being able to affect the integrity of the industrial systems in any way.\nUkraine has been described as a 'testing ground' for cyber operations: in addition to the widely reported Russian cyber operations, there are a multitude of cyber-espionage operations reported in Eastern Ukraine ostensibly collecting intelligence on the situation there . The cyber operations described above exhibit a worrying trend, in that industrial controls systems could be targeted and could cause disruption to critical infrastructure; also of concern is the scale of the 'collateral damage' that NotPetya caused. Such cyber operations are clearly strategic and are intended to target civilian infrastructure, possibly to erode daily functioning of a country as well as the psychological resilience of the population. In this sense, cyber operations are being used, or at least attempted to being used, in a manner similar to strategic bombers of World War II, albeit with more precision and less physical destruction.\nPropaganda was a continuous feature surrounding the separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine, where the narratives echoed that of Russian and former Soviet propaganda, with some echoes of World War II. These narratives also indicate a type of extremist viewpoint, where the separatists portray themselves as heroically protecting their values, but are victims of overwhelming hostile adversaries: primarily Ukraine, supported by the majority of the world (Kostyuchenko &amp; Pushkar\nJournal of Information Warfare\n2022). During the COVID pandemic, the separatist groups spread conspiracy theories to erode confidence in the government measures and also suggested that the U.S. biolabs created the virus . Doroshenko and Lukito (2021) illustrate that pro-Russian influence operations related to Ukraine are an evolution of the Cold War concept of reflexive control for the digital world. These operations engage with the audience in such a way that their decision making is favourable to the objectives of the perpetrator. In an attempt to counter influence operations and propaganda for war in the context of Ukraine, Richter (2015) contends that countries utilised their own local laws, whereas a set of international norms might have proven to be more effective. While little is reported of EW use during this period, Russian EW units have reportedly supported the separatists by distributing propaganda over cellular phone networks in addition to disrupting and detecting (for targeting purposes) Ukrainian communications .\nWhile IW operations were not as intense in terms of the amount outside of major military operations (or less attention was being paid to the IW activities), they were still present. During this period some of the most notable cyber operations were conducted, namely NotPetya and the attacks against the electric grid, taking a step closer to what could potentially produce a blackout across major portions of a country. These operations appeared to be preparation for what was to come in 2022, which is covered in the next section.\n## Information Warfare in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Conflict\nDue to the amount of information available about the IW efforts in the 2022 conflict, this section will be divided to focus on specific areas; however, there may still be overlaps (for example cyber-enabled influence operations). Cyber operations are discussed first, followed by influence operations, and then a section on other notable IW activities during the conflict.\n## Cyber operations\nThe number of recorded cyber operations for the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict is notable; it is possible that there was more activity, but at the same time there was more attention to cyber operations during the conflict. The CyberPeace Institute (2022b) has an interactive portal dedicated to tracking cyber incidents during the conflict, and recorded 626 alleged incidents in 2022 related to the Ukraine conflict; this averages to nearly two incidents per day.\nIn January there were some wiper attacks, website defacements of government websites, and attempts to compromise government organisations. In February, incidents of cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, and disinformation were reported. Immediately preceding the invasion (23 February), more DDoS attacks, wipers, and ransomware were reported. During the initial stages of the Russian incursion into Ukraine (24-25 February), DDoS, wipers, phishing, social media-based disinformation, and website compromises were seen; the DDoS attacks and disinformation continued to late February, and in early March cyber operations targeted the media and communications sector, and malware targeted non-government organisations (CyberPeace Institute 2022b).\nFigure 1 illustrates the composition of the 626 cyber-operations recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), categorised into 10 incident types from January to October. As is evident from the figure, the majority of the incidents were DDoS, followed by hack and leak operations. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalent categories of 201 cyber incidents that targeted Ukraine; the 158 incidents that targeted Russia are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 illustrates the categories of 267 incidents\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nrelated to the conflict that targeted nations or organisations globally. DDoS attacks were the most prevalent type, targeting Ukraine and global targets, while hack and leak operations were the most prevalent against Russia.\nFigure 1: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 2: Types of cyber operations targeting Ukraine, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 3: Types of cyber operations targeting Russia, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 4: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict targeting the rest of the world, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of cyber incidents per month. Those targeting Ukraine began in January, increased in February, with an initial peak in March. Many of these may have been preparatory in nature, as with previous conflicts, to disrupt communication and disseminate disinformation in an attempt to dominate the information sphere during the early stages of the conflict. Those targeting Russia began in February, with an increase in March, and initial peak in April. These lagged the incidents against Ukraine by a month, and were probably retaliatory in nature. The incidents with global impact began in January, with a slight increase in February, peaking in April. However, the decline was slower than that of Russia and Ukraine. All areas experienced second peaks from August to October.\nFigure 5: Number of cyber operations targeting the belligerents (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 6 illustrates the number of incidents for each category per month. Due to the number of DDoS incidents, these are shown on a separate graph. The DDoS attacks peaked drastically in August and September, to an extent that they overshadowed some of the other categories. In January, wipers and defacement were most prevalent, with cyber espionage and wipers being the most prevalent in March and April. This speaks to how cyber operations are used by Russia. The use of volunteers for Ukraine is discussed in more detail later. A report by Microsoft concurred that most destructive attacks (for example, wipers) occurred in the first week of the conflict, and  $40\\%$  of the destructive attacks targeted critical infrastructure (Digital Security Unit 2022).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\n(b) DDoS and total\nFigure 6: Types of cyber operations per month (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFrom Figure 7, it is evident that hacking collectives are by far the most prevalent threat actor type, followed by nation-state actors. This further demonstrates the role of non-state actors in the cyber domain during the conflict. Of the 65 unique threat actors identified by the CyberPeace Institute, 38 were supporting Russia and 27 were supporting Ukraine. Two interesting threat actors supporting Russia originated from Brazil and Iraq (CyberPeace Institute 2022), which falls outside of the usual online belligerents related to the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The weighting towards the\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\ncollectives is not necessarily unusual; however, Ukraine did follow a strategy of openly calling for international cyber volunteers to support its cyber operations (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022). This, however, raises concerns that, while such volunteers and hacktivists are often seen during times of heightened political tension, their presence when there is an actual physical conflict could unintentionally involve countries that are essentially neutral, or the cyber volunteers could potentially be classified as mercenaries or combatants and open themselves (and the country they reside in) to retaliation. In addition to the volunteers, cybercriminal groups openly chose sides . However, a ransomware gang that declared its support for Russia experienced leaks of information, thought to be Ukrainian members of the group retaliating; these leaks provided useful insights into the operations of ransomware groups .\nFigure 7: Types of threat actors (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nFigure 8 illustrates the types of cyber operations that each threat actor type was conducting. The collectives overwhelmingly favoured DDoS and hack and leak operations; nation state actors accounted for more cyber espionage, 'other' incidents, and wipers. Given the timing of the hack and leak operations shown in Figure 6(a), and the prevalence of hack and leak operations against Russia (Figure 3) and that they were committed by collectives, it can be deduced that these may have been volunteers targeting Russia in retaliation for the invasion and the for the support of cyber operations. Similarly, globally there were a number of DDoS attacks from August to October (Figure 6[a]), also conducted by collectives. These largely affected global targets, but also Ukraine and Russia. Some of these DDoS attacks could have grown out of frustration by pro-Russian groups of the waning support to Russia; for example, multiple websites of the Bulgarian Government were targeted for what the perpetrator claimed was the Bulgarian betrayal of Russia . A situation may have arisen where various hacking collectives began targeting countries as a series of reprisals; van Niekerk and Maharaj (2011) predicted this as a likely occurrence in a cyber conflict, based on a series of retaliatory cyber incidents in support of either Wikileaks or the U.S. government in 2010.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\nJournal of Information Warfare\nThe Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n(b) DDoS and Total\nFigure 8: Types of incident per threat actor type (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\nSome notable incidents include a cyber operation against a broadband satellite provider, Viasat, on 24 February . This illustrates a continuation of the practice of targeting media and communication platforms alongside the initial military operations. In addition to significant damage to the terminals at Viasat, the 'collateral damage' of the incident affected parts of Europe, including remote access to over 5000 wind turbines in Germany . A border control station between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly affected by a wiper malware on 25 February, slowing down the processing of Ukrainian refugees . A number of cyber operations against industrial systems were reported: Belarusian hacktivist collectives claimed that they targeted railway systems to hinder Russian troop movements (Gallagher &amp; Bloomberg 2022); cyber operations (which ultimately failed) targeting power companies that included wiper malware as well as an updated version of the malware used to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 were found, (ESET Research 2022; Goodchild 2022). In addition, a Russian taxi operator was compromised and all taxis were instructed to go to the same location in Moscow, causing a traffic jam . These attacks are outside of the usual website defacements and DDoS attacks that have traditionally been exhibited during times of conflict.\nObservers commented on the lack of visible cyber operations by Russia after the early stages of the conflict, as it was expected by some to have been much greater by several researchers (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022; Schneider 2022). By comparison, Russia appeared a much greater cyber power in relation to Ukraine: the National Cyber Power Index 2020 listed Russia as  $4^{\\text{th}}$  and Ukraine as  $26^{\\text{th}}$  of 30 countries ; therefore, a strong presence by Russia in the cyber arena would have made sense. Proposed reasons for the quieter than expected cyber domain are that, in a physical conflict, kinetic weapons are more useful and cyber operations are more suited for deception and deniability, making them ideal for use outside of open conflict (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022). Urchill (2022) indicates that the attempts against the Ukrainian power grid indicate that cyber operations were active, which negates the growing narrative that they were quiet. The number of cyber incidents recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b) and illustrated by the figures above indicate that there was a significant amount\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof activity. While there were attacks on critical infrastructure, they did not succeed due to (at least in part) assistance that Ukraine received . In addition to the volunteers supporting Ukraine mentioned above, there was formal foreign assistance, including ‘hunt forward' operations by the U.S. Cyber Command . The scope of the foreign assistance included forward deployments and remote assistance for cyber defence by both vendors and official personnel, the sharing of threat intelligence, and services provided to improve the resilience of Ukrainian systems, such as migrating to Cloud storage .\nThe coordination of cyber operations with physical military operations by Russian forces is illustrated in general by the Microsoft report, where both physical and virtual attacks appear to drive at the same objective (Digital Security Unit 2022). Specific examples include the Viasat (a contractor for the Ukrainian military) incident, mentioned above, is a contractor for the Ukrainian military) and coordinated cyber and kinetic attacks against power companies . In addition, propaganda and information operations overlap with cyber operations, indicated by the cyber-enabled information operations in Figures 1 through 4, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. The cyber dimension has therefore played an important role in the conflict, although it did not achieve the full potential and the inherit limitations still preclude it from having a direct impact on the battlefield (van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk & Ramluckan 2022).\n## Psychological operations, disinformation, and influence campaigns\nInformation warfare in the cognitive domain is a key aspect of any conflict. Within the Rusian Ukraine war, there was a heavy cyber-enabled component to disinformation (including use of a deepfake and media manipulation), as well as some traditional PSYOP techniques. Immediately prior to and in the early days of the Russian invasion, disinformation was disseminated by SMS and social media, including the use of compromised social media accounts. In addition, the media and communication sectors were targeted by cyber operations (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In addition to affecting command and control, targeting such sectors reduced the amount of information that the government could provide to its citizens or to the outside world, in theory giving the Russian narrative more dominance.\nFacebook and Instagram accounts were used to spoof European news sites, publishing disinformation to over 60 websites; upon identifying the operation which began in May, Meta disabled the offending accounts. It was reported that this was the largest disinformation operation since the beginning of the conflict, and it used “an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force” . It was found that bots spreading disinformation against the U.S. reduced the amount of anti-vaccination content and increased pro-Russian content during the first months of the war; however, this effort did not gain traction . Over 300 disinformation sites related to the war were identified, and a number of narratives were shared including; a fighter pilot known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv' shooting down Russian aircraft, a deepfake of President Zelensky calling for surrender, U.S. bioweapons labs in Europe, videos of a President Putin in jail due to a coup, and examples of media manipulation to discredit Ukrainian government officials . In Hungary, traditional billboards were used to equate the sanctions against Russia to armed attacks and styling them as excessive . This is an example that ‘traditional' influence is still present, despite the move to the digital environment.\nCertain themes were again present, particularly accusations of Nazism. However, some claims had been taken too far, prompting President Putin to make an apology (Bella, Hendrix & Ilyushin 2022). However, the symbols painted on Russian military vehicles gained their own status, akin to the Nazi use of the swastika. The various symbols caused much speculation, but one in particular, ‘Z', has become a symbol for the Russian aggression and is seen as a pro-war symbol . This association has led some organisations to change their logos and some European countries to ban the public display of the symbol, although these moves have also been used to make claims of Russophobia .\nA difference between 2014 and 2022 is that Ukraine had a fledgling government when Crimea was annexed it just having ousted the pro-Russian government; in 2022, the government was more stable and had years of experience dealing with disinformation and the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Zelensky's repeated presentations at national forums calling for assistance and sanctions aided in providing an almost unified front against Russia. The Ukrainian propaganda portraying heroism was particularly successful and the overall influence of the propaganda effort was key to keep the flow of funding and weapons as well as the sanctions in place . By contrast, the Russian propaganda effort appeared to be thinly disguised distraction and dismissal to Western audiences, often making false claims against Ukraine or the U.S. (such as that they were using dirty bombs or counter-accusations of war crimes), continuing the 4Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay) seen in previous iterations of the boarder conflict. While there was more international engagement, such as speeches by Minister Lavrov which were met by walkouts . However, the walkouts could be presented to the Russian population as evidence of a hostile West, and the speeches could be aimed at the Russian population rather than the immediate audience. The Russian internal-facing propaganda appeared to be somewhat effective, with many Russians not believing there was a war in Ukraine and then later believing that Russia could win .\n## Other areas of IW\nThis section focuses on the reports of intelligence and electronic warfare activities during the conflict. A notable aspect was proactive intelligence disclosures by the U.S. predicting the invasion and the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines . The increasingly important role of open-source intelligence that was reinforced by the Russian invasion is highlighted by Wait (2022a), where valuable information could be obtained from the Internet and social media in particular, and collectives of investigative journalists were able to aid in providing attribution.\nFor EW, there were reports that flights from Estonia to Finland had to return due to GPS interference, which had also been detected along the Finland-Russian border . The Starlink satellite systems provided to Ukraine reportedly experienced jamming; however, it was claimed that this was resolved after a software update . Russian media reported that a NATO drone had been jammed over the Black Sea . While both sides have used EW, indications are that the Russian use has improved since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular its EW units are now learning to counter NATO equipment that has been supplied to Ukraine . The Ukrainian government urged citizens to aid the military by disrupting Russian support units, with communications and EW units being emphasised as a target ; this may be an indication that the Russian EW was having an impact on the\nbattlefield. The EW in the conflict is being used to inform the U.S. military's planning; in addition, Russian EW equipment found abandoned will probably provide useful intelligence .\n## Discussion\nFrom the descriptions above, IW has had an important role to play in the conflicts in Ukraine. While in some aspects there are new activities, others have remained constant or have shown gradual evolution.\nSome of the key differences from 2014 to 2022 include multinational support, both through organisations and official representation, that has aided Ukraine in the 2022 conflict. This extends beyond the financing and weapons delivery, but includes active support in the cyber domain, with foreign intelligence services admitting to conducting operations to bolster the defence of Ukraine's cyberspace. These include the deployment of forward-hunting operations to aid in disabling hostile cyberoperations; however, these will also prove useful in gathering intelligence on Russian cyber capabilities.\nThe use of wiper malware, being more destructive and targeting infrastructure, as well as hack and leak operations are new tactics in the cyber domain, even though the use of DDoS and website defacements were still prevalent. There appeared to be increased targeting of industrial systems, including satellite communications. While there were incidents between the two major stages of armed conflict, these may have been in preparation for a major military incursion into Ukraine. The number of attempts against Ukrainian power utilities, although largely foiled from causing widespread outages, indicates that this may have been part of a strategy to force the Ukrainian population into submission and to hasten a military conquest of the country. It is possible that there was an over-reliance on these aspects, and, when they failed, the troops on the ground met much stiffer resistance than expected.\nThe potential for increased cyber operations resulted in more attention to the environment, and active tracking of reported incidents by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), giving a detailed record of alleged incidents. This has given more insight into the use of cyber operations than during any prior political crisis or conflict. In addition, open calls by the Ukrainian government for a ‘volunteer cyber army' represented the first time a nation has publicly encouraged civilians to engage in hostile cyber activity against another nation on such a scale. This will have contributed to the increased cyber activity, but also raises several questions which, until that point, had been rhetorical: how would civilians engaging in cyber operations against a state during a time of armed conflict be classified, and what measure can be taken against them in order to protect critical systems?\nDisinformation and influence operations played a role from 2014 through 2022. A difference was that the current Ukrainian government had been in place when the conflict started, and had more experience dealing with influence campaigns than the government that had just taken office in 2014. This has shown in the way the Ukrainian government, led by President Zelensky, has engaged with other world leaders to solidify support for its war efforts.\nLeading up to the Russian invasion in 2022, unprecedented proactive intelligence disclosures were made warning of the impending invasion, and subsequently for the attacks on the Nordstream pipelines. However, similar attempts were made by Russia which were received as falsehoods in\nthat the same accusations were levelled against Russia. This may change the nature of intelligence sharing and make intelligence more open source.\nDespite some differences and new techniques and tactics, there are similarities from 2014 to 2022. Hacktivist involvement, website defacement, and DDoS attacks are ever-present factors. Cyber operations were coordinated with physical operations; however, there seems to be an evolution to include new targets and methods as discussed above. In both 2014 and 2022, observers commented that they thought cyber operations would play a larger role than what materialised; however, the number of cyber incidents has grown significantly. The prevailing theory, which is supported by evidence, is that cyber operations are more suitable for use outside of open armed conflict, and that what did occur in 2022 had limited military tactical benefit, as indicated by van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk, and Ramluckan (2022). The opposing view was that the heightened preparedness and international support blunted the impact of the initial aggressive cyber operations.\nIn the cognitive domain, similar narratives for disinformation and influence operations were prevalent, and similar tactics remained from 2014 through 2022. On the intelligence front, the role of open source intelligence, fuelled in part by social media remained; however, this is evolving to become more prevalent, as posited by van Niekerk (2015).\n## Conclusion\nInformation warfare has played a significant part in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, since the Maidan uprisings overthrowing the pro-Russian Ukrainian government, through the annexation of Crimea, the separatist movements in the East, up to and including the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict. This history provides a particularly useful case study to investigate how IW has evolved (and remained the same) over the eight-year period.\nSome new tactics, particularly in the cyber domain—such as wipers and infrastructure attacks—emerged in 2022 compared to 2014; however, between 2015 and 2017, these appeared to have been tested. International support aided in the Ukrainian war effort, including forward-hunting teams for cyber defence and proactive intelligence disclosures. Electronic warfare use appeared to remain constant throughout. Disinformation and influence operations also remained constant, as did some of the major narratives; however, in 2022, this was a more contested space, compared to 2014.\nWhile the future remains uncertain, cyber operations may not play a major role on the battlefield for the foreseeable future; however, the quantity and intensity of cyber operations due to conflict and particularly immediately preceding conflict may continue to grow, as is evidenced from what happened between 2014 and 2022. Similarly, disinformation and influence operations are likely to intensify with some evolution. Intelligence may show the largest evolution going forward, with more open releases and greater use of open sources, given the pervasive connectivity of devices and information posted on social media."

In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.\n\nKeywords: Cyber operations, Disinformation, Information Warfare, Intelligence Disclosures, Volunteer Cyber Army\n\n# Introduction\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered into Ukrainian sovereign territory in what was termed a 'special military operation'.

    "The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n\nThe article considers openly available reports of IW activity during the conflict in Ukraine to illustrate the evolution of tactics from 2014 up to and including 2022. The next section provides an overview of key IW activity in the 2014 crisis and annexation of Crimea. This is followed by the relevant activity between the main events of 2014 and 2022. The next section covers the IW activity during the 2022 conflict. Thereafter, a discussion to highlight the key evolutions of IW is conducted, and the article is then concluded.\n\n# Information Warfare in the 2014 Protests and the Annexation of Crimea\n\nThe use of IW in the 2014 Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea were discussed in-depth previously by the author (van Niekerk 2015). This section will provide a summary of key points from that chapter, which provides as a baseline against which the IW activities in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict can be benchmarked. The crisis in Ukraine began at the end of 2013 with protests against the pro-Russian government, during which social media played a role. In 2014, as the protests continued, security forces became violent, resulting in the protests intensifying and the situation escalating. Eventually the Ukrainian president fled to Russia, and a new government was installed by 23 February 2014. However, pro-Russian protests began, and social media was used to divide ethnic Russians by spreading fear, which the new government did not address. A week later, armed militia began seizing key points in Crimea, and, in early March, a video emerged of Russian-made military equipment entering Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied the forces were theirs, but by 16 March a referendum had been held, claiming that the majority of Crimeans wished to join Russia, completing the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Subsequently, pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine began seizing buildings and a period of low-intensity conflict began, during which the downing of MH17 occurred. The diplomatic response to these actions was the implementation and increasing sanctions on Russia, and Russia putting pressure on Ukraine to pay for gas supplies.\n\nThe protests in Ukraine were a useful case study, as they could be benchmarked against the Orange Revolution of 2004, prior to extensive use of social media in popular uprisings. This comparison illustrated that social media gave anti-government protestors and journalists a platform for mass-dissemination of information outside of the state-controlled traditional media, and that the protestors found this information more reliable than formal news platforms (Onuch 2014; Satell 2014). During the incursion in Crimea, Russian media made numerous claims which indicated chaos and mass defections in Ukraine, many of which were shown to be inaccurate; in addition, images began showing that the forces in Crimea were in fact Russian, as images of the same individuals were shown from the Russian incursion into Georgia in 2008 (van Niekerk 2015). A key perspective was provided by Kates and Butorin (2014), who indicated that the Russian media was providing a reality to their target audience, namely the Russian population, in order to maintain support, and this did not necessarily align with reality. This was generally successful as a majority of the Russian population trusted the Russian media, and the persistent rhetoric dominated over other sources provided an 'alternate' truth (Kates &amp; Butorin 2014). The use of pro-Russian 'trolls' to discredit social media and blog posters was reported, indicating attempts to dominate the narrative on social media and online (chornajuravka 2014).\n\nCyber operations were present prior to and during the annexation of Crimea, in particular cyber-espionage, distributed denial of service attacks, and website defacements. Cyber-espionage campaigns were present well before the crisis in 2013/2014, with a number of campaigns targeting Ukraine and other nations within the Russian sphere of influence and with another cyber-espionage\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "campaign predominantly targeting Ukraine in 2013 and 2014 (van Niekerk 2015). One particular cyber-espionage campaign of 2013 bears specific mention in that the lure was fake Ukrainian foreign policy documents purporting to show Ukraine's plans to seek NATO membership (Mimoso 2013). As the narratives giving rise to the tensions in 2014, and as discussed later in 2022, this theme becomes core. Webpage defacements had begun in early November 2013, pre-dating the protests; however, the themes are worth recognition in the context of this article: the defacement of Ukrainian government websites and the distribution of false emails both contained a message claiming to be from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Kovacs 2013). During the initial stages of armed incursion in Crimea, webpage defacements targeting the Russian government and organisations routinely used the term ‘Nazi” (van Niekerk 2015).\n\nThe most common cyber incident was DDoS attacks. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was targeted in retaliation for the alleged hacks mentioned above (Kovacs 2013). A notable tactic was the use of DDoS attacks in conjunction with physical attacks against the communication infrastructure during the early stages of the armed incursion into Crimea, which disrupted the Ukrainian forces' based in Crimea ability to communicate; in addition, mobile phones of the Ukrainian parliament were disrupted (Vamosi 2014). This tactic was seen previously in the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The DDoS attacks also became prevalent prior to the scheduled Crimean referendum to join Russia—although the majority of DDoS incidents were claimed by hacktivist groups (van Niekerk 2015). Commentary on the cyber incidents surrounding the Ukrainian political crisis and the annexation of Crimea indicated surprise about the limited and constrained use of cyber operations by Russia, with suggestions that the Ukrainian hackers were more skilled and could mount stronger retaliations (Clayton 2014a; Gady 2014).\n\nIn May 2014, there was an attempt to disrupt and interfere with the Ukrainian 2014 presidential election. Clayton (2014b) indicates attempts were made to delete data, leak information, alter the voting totals (with the use of malware), and then disrupt access with a DDoS attack. The attack was attributed to a pro-Russian hacktivist group; however, this has been refuted (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). A disinformation operation was coordinated with the attempt to alter voting data, as a Russian news channel incorrectly reported a win of the pro-Russian candidate with the same voting percentages that the above-mentioned malware attempted to insert into the voting platform. This implies a concerted effort to use cyber operations and disinformation to ‘hijack' the election in a way that aligned with the Russian propaganda narrative (Clayton 2014b).\n\nThe use of electronic warfare appeared limited, with only a single report, which claimed that Russian satellite television had been jammed (Rehle 2014). From an intelligence perspective, social media proved to be useful for open source intelligence; where videos of troop movements appeared, selfies aided in identifying possible Russian troops and aided in attribution for the downing of flight MH17 (van Niekerk 2015).\n\nIn summary, the IW activities in 2014 began exhibiting boarder coordination amongst cyber operations, the propaganda effort, and physical operations on the ground. The IW operations did not stop, but a few notable incidents occurred between the major events of 2014 and 2022, which will be covered in the next section.\n\n## Information Warfare in the ‘Inter-War' Period\n\nBetween the main events of 2014, as described above, and the direct military conflict in 2022",
    "The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n\n(discussed in the next section), a number of information warfare activities occurred that were notable. Of key interest are a series of cyber operations which demonstrated the potential for significant impact and disruption through cyber means, and some foreshadowed other similar events that occurred subsequently.\n\nIn December of both 2015 and 2016, malware impacted parts of the Ukrainian electricity grid, resulting in a loss of power to the areas serviced by the affected substations. In 2015, 16 substations were affected, disrupting the electricity supply for up to six hours for over 200,000 customers. This malware was attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Sandworm (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In 2016 another APT, known as Electrum with reported links to the Sandworm APT, caused a shorter disruption, which affected about a fifth of Kyiv's supply. However, the functionality of the malware indicated the potential for causing broader cascading effects across the power grid (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Dragos 2017). In October 2016 it was reported that a Ukrainian hacktivist group had conducted a 'hack and leak' operation against a senior Russian official's emails, which provided evidence that Russia was involved in the 2014 separatist movements (Kramer 2016).\n\nIn June 2017, a modified version of the Petya ransomware appeared to target Ukrainian organisations, but then rapidly spread globally in what is the most expensive cyber incident recorded. The malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability, used by the WannaCry ransomware worm the month before, but it was also modified so the encryption was irreversible, resulting in it being renamed NotPetya and reclassified as a wiper. While NotPetya was known for its global financial impact that exceeded 10 billion USD and disrupted shipping company Maersk, it impacted a number of Ukrainian organisations, including radiation monitoring at Chernobyl (CyberPeace Institute 2022a; Greenberg 2018). In 2018, a water filtration plant experienced a cyber operation attributed to Russia, which was reportedly fended off. The operation employed the VPNFilter malware that targeted networking devices (Osborne 2018). Slowik (2018) indicates that the technical details are scarce, and the fact that the malware originally could only intercept traffic and not modify it indicates that this may have been intelligence gathering to prepare for a cyber operation against the plant, rather than being able to affect the integrity of the industrial systems in any way.\n\nUkraine has been described as a 'testing ground' for cyber operations: in addition to the widely reported Russian cyber operations, there are a multitude of cyber-espionage operations reported in Eastern Ukraine ostensibly collecting intelligence on the situation there (Cerulus 2019). The cyber operations described above exhibit a worrying trend, in that industrial controls systems could be targeted and could cause disruption to critical infrastructure; also of concern is the scale of the 'collateral damage' that NotPetya caused. Such cyber operations are clearly strategic and are intended to target civilian infrastructure, possibly to erode daily functioning of a country as well as the psychological resilience of the population. In this sense, cyber operations are being used, or at least attempted to being used, in a manner similar to strategic bombers of World War II, albeit with more precision and less physical destruction.\n\nPropaganda was a continuous feature surrounding the separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine, where the narratives echoed that of Russian and former Soviet propaganda, with some echoes of World War II. These narratives also indicate a type of extremist viewpoint, where the separatists portray themselves as heroically protecting their values, but are victims of overwhelming hostile adversaries: primarily Ukraine, supported by the majority of the world (Kostyuchenko &amp; Pushkar\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "2022). During the COVID pandemic, the separatist groups spread conspiracy theories to erode confidence in the government measures and also suggested that the U.S. biolabs created the virus (Kostyuchenko et al. 2022). Doroshenko and Lukito (2021) illustrate that pro-Russian influence operations related to Ukraine are an evolution of the Cold War concept of reflexive control for the digital world. These operations engage with the audience in such a way that their decision making is favourable to the objectives of the perpetrator. In an attempt to counter influence operations and propaganda for war in the context of Ukraine, Richter (2015) contends that countries utilised their own local laws, whereas a set of international norms might have proven to be more effective. While little is reported of EW use during this period, Russian EW units have reportedly supported the separatists by distributing propaganda over cellular phone networks in addition to disrupting and detecting (for targeting purposes) Ukrainian communications (Clark 2022).\n\nWhile IW operations were not as intense in terms of the amount outside of major military operations (or less attention was being paid to the IW activities), they were still present. During this period some of the most notable cyber operations were conducted, namely NotPetya and the attacks against the electric grid, taking a step closer to what could potentially produce a blackout across major portions of a country. These operations appeared to be preparation for what was to come in 2022, which is covered in the next section.\n\n## Information Warfare in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Conflict\n\nDue to the amount of information available about the IW efforts in the 2022 conflict, this section will be divided to focus on specific areas; however, there may still be overlaps (for example cyber-enabled influence operations). Cyber operations are discussed first, followed by influence operations, and then a section on other notable IW activities during the conflict.\n\n## Cyber operations\n\nThe number of recorded cyber operations for the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict is notable; it is possible that there was more activity, but at the same time there was more attention to cyber operations during the conflict. The CyberPeace Institute (2022b) has an interactive portal dedicated to tracking cyber incidents during the conflict, and recorded 626 alleged incidents in 2022 related to the Ukraine conflict; this averages to nearly two incidents per day.\n\nIn January there were some wiper attacks, website defacements of government websites, and attempts to compromise government organisations. In February, incidents of cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, and disinformation were reported. Immediately preceding the invasion (23 February), more DDoS attacks, wipers, and ransomware were reported. During the initial stages of the Russian incursion into Ukraine (24-25 February), DDoS, wipers, phishing, social media-based disinformation, and website compromises were seen; the DDoS attacks and disinformation continued to late February, and in early March cyber operations targeted the media and communications sector, and malware targeted non-government organisations (CyberPeace Institute 2022b).\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the composition of the 626 cyber-operations recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), categorised into 10 incident types from January to October. As is evident from the figure, the majority of the incidents were DDoS, followed by hack and leak operations. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalent categories of 201 cyber incidents that targeted Ukraine; the 158 incidents that targeted Russia are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 illustrates the categories of 267 incidents",
    "The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n\nrelated to the conflict that targeted nations or organisations globally. DDoS attacks were the most prevalent type, targeting Ukraine and global targets, while hack and leak operations were the most prevalent against Russia.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1: Types of cyber operations related to the Ukraine conflict, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2: Types of cyber operations targeting Ukraine, January-October 2022 (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

    "The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n\nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of cyber incidents per month. Those targeting Ukraine began in January, increased in February, with an initial peak in March. Many of these may have been preparatory in nature, as with previous conflicts, to disrupt communication and disseminate disinformation in an attempt to dominate the information sphere during the early stages of the conflict. Those targeting Russia began in February, with an increase in March, and initial peak in April. These lagged the incidents against Ukraine by a month, and were probably retaliatory in nature. The incidents with global impact began in January, with a slight increase in February, peaking in April. However, the decline was slower than that of Russia and Ukraine. All areas experienced second peaks from August to October.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 5: Number of cyber operations targeting the belligerents (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\n\nFigure 6 illustrates the number of incidents for each category per month. Due to the number of DDoS incidents, these are shown on a separate graph. The DDoS attacks peaked drastically in August and September, to an extent that they overshadowed some of the other categories. In January, wipers and defacement were most prevalent, with cyber espionage and wipers being the most prevalent in March and April. This speaks to how cyber operations are used by Russia. The use of volunteers for Ukraine is discussed in more detail later. A report by Microsoft concurred that most destructive attacks (for example, wipers) occurred in the first week of the conflict, and  $40\\%$  of the destructive attacks targeted critical infrastructure (Digital Security Unit 2022).\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n(a) Excluding DDoS and total\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n(b) DDoS and total\nFigure 6: Types of cyber operations per month (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\n\nFrom Figure 7, it is evident that hacking collectives are by far the most prevalent threat actor type, followed by nation-state actors. This further demonstrates the role of non-state actors in the cyber domain during the conflict. Of the 65 unique threat actors identified by the CyberPeace Institute, 38 were supporting Russia and 27 were supporting Ukraine. Two interesting threat actors supporting Russia originated from Brazil and Iraq (CyberPeace Institute 2022), which falls outside of the usual online belligerents related to the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The weighting towards the\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "The Evolution of Information Warfare in Ukraine: 2014 to 2022\n\ncollectives is not necessarily unusual; however, Ukraine did follow a strategy of openly calling for international cyber volunteers to support its cyber operations (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022). This, however, raises concerns that, while such volunteers and hacktivists are often seen during times of heightened political tension, their presence when there is an actual physical conflict could unintentionally involve countries that are essentially neutral, or the cyber volunteers could potentially be classified as mercenaries or combatants and open themselves (and the country they reside in) to retaliation. In addition to the volunteers, cybercriminal groups openly chose sides (Ilascu 2022). However, a ransomware gang that declared its support for Russia experienced leaks of information, thought to be Ukrainian members of the group retaliating; these leaks provided useful insights into the operations of ransomware groups (Pitrelli 2022).\n\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\nFigure 7: Types of threat actors (adapted from CyberPeace Institute [2022b])\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the types of cyber operations that each threat actor type was conducting. The collectives overwhelmingly favoured DDoS and hack and leak operations; nation state actors accounted for more cyber espionage, 'other' incidents, and wipers. Given the timing of the hack and leak operations shown in Figure 6(a), and the prevalence of hack and leak operations against Russia (Figure 3) and that they were committed by collectives, it can be deduced that these may have been volunteers targeting Russia in retaliation for the invasion and the for the support of cyber operations. Similarly, globally there were a number of DDoS attacks from August to October (Figure 6[a]), also conducted by collectives. These largely affected global targets, but also Ukraine and Russia. Some of these DDoS attacks could have grown out of frustration by pro-Russian groups of the waning support to Russia; for example, multiple websites of the Bulgarian Government were targeted for what the perpetrator claimed was the Bulgarian betrayal of Russia (Antoniuk 2022). A situation may have arisen where various hacking collectives began targeting countries as a series of reprisals; van Niekerk and Maharaj (2011) predicted this as a likely occurrence in a cyber conflict, based on a series of retaliatory cyber incidents in support of either Wikileaks or the U.S. government in 2010.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

This illustrates a continuation of the practice of targeting media and communication platforms alongside the initial military operations. In addition to significant damage to the terminals at Viasat, the 'collateral damage' of the incident affected parts of Europe, including remote access to over 5000 wind turbines in Germany (Page 2022). A border control station between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly affected by a wiper malware on 25 February, slowing down the processing of Ukrainian refugees (Berger 2022). A number of cyber operations against industrial systems were reported: Belarusian hacktivist collectives claimed that they targeted railway systems to hinder Russian troop movements (Gallagher &amp; Bloomberg 2022); cyber operations (which ultimately failed) targeting power companies that included wiper malware as well as an updated version of the malware used to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 were found, (ESET Research 2022; Goodchild 2022). In addition, a Russian taxi operator was compromised and all taxis were instructed to go to the same location in Moscow, causing a traffic jam (Roth 2022). These attacks are outside of the usual website defacements and DDoS attacks that have traditionally been exhibited during times of conflict.\n\nObservers commented on the lack of visible cyber operations by Russia after the early stages of the conflict, as it was expected by some to have been much greater by several researchers (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022; Schneider 2022). By comparison, Russia appeared a much greater cyber power in relation to Ukraine: the National Cyber Power Index 2020 listed Russia as  $4^{\\text{th}}$  and Ukraine as  $26^{\\text{th}}$  of 30 countries (Voo et al. 2020); therefore, a strong presence by Russia in the cyber arena would have made sense. Proposed reasons for the quieter than expected cyber domain are that, in a physical conflict, kinetic weapons are more useful and cyber operations are more suited for deception and deniability, making them ideal for use outside of open conflict (Fendorf &amp; Miller 2022; Maschmeyer &amp; Kostyuk 2022). Urchill (2022) indicates that the attempts against the Ukrainian power grid indicate that cyber operations were active, which negates the growing narrative that they were quiet. The number of cyber incidents recorded by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b) and illustrated by the figures above indicate that there was a significant amount\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "of activity. While there were attacks on critical infrastructure, they did not succeed due to (at least in part) assistance that Ukraine received (Goodchild 2022; Landau 2022). In addition to the volunteers supporting Ukraine mentioned above, there was formal foreign assistance, including ‘hunt forward' operations by the U.S. Cyber Command (Janofsky 2022). The scope of the foreign assistance included forward deployments and remote assistance for cyber defence by both vendors and official personnel, the sharing of threat intelligence, and services provided to improve the resilience of Ukrainian systems, such as migrating to Cloud storage (Beecroft 2022; Martin 2022a; Martin 2022b).\n\nThe coordination of cyber operations with physical military operations by Russian forces is illustrated in general by the Microsoft report, where both physical and virtual attacks appear to drive at the same objective (Digital Security Unit 2022). Specific examples include the Viasat (a contractor for the Ukrainian military) incident, mentioned above, is a contractor for the Ukrainian military) and coordinated cyber and kinetic attacks against power companies (Petkauskas 2022). In addition, propaganda and information operations overlap with cyber operations, indicated by the cyber-enabled information operations in Figures 1 through 4, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. The cyber dimension has therefore played an important role in the conflict, although it did not achieve the full potential and the inherit limitations still preclude it from having a direct impact on the battlefield (van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk & Ramluckan 2022).\n\n## Psychological operations, disinformation, and influence campaigns\n\nInformation warfare in the cognitive domain is a key aspect of any conflict. Within the Rusian Ukraine war, there was a heavy cyber-enabled component to disinformation (including use of a deepfake and media manipulation), as well as some traditional PSYOP techniques. Immediately prior to and in the early days of the Russian invasion, disinformation was disseminated by SMS and social media, including the use of compromised social media accounts. In addition, the media and communication sectors were targeted by cyber operations (CyberPeace Institute 2022a). In addition to affecting command and control, targeting such sectors reduced the amount of information that the government could provide to its citizens or to the outside world, in theory giving the Russian narrative more dominance.\n\nFacebook and Instagram accounts were used to spoof European news sites, publishing disinformation to over 60 websites; upon identifying the operation which began in May, Meta disabled the offending accounts. It was reported that this was the largest disinformation operation since the beginning of the conflict, and it used “an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force” (Gatlan 2022b). It was found that bots spreading disinformation against the U.S. reduced the amount of anti-vaccination content and increased pro-Russian content during the first months of the war; however, this effort did not gain traction (Wait 2022b). Over 300 disinformation sites related to the war were identified, and a number of narratives were shared including; a fighter pilot known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv' shooting down Russian aircraft, a deepfake of President Zelensky calling for surrender, U.S. bioweapons labs in Europe, videos of a President Putin in jail due to a coup, and examples of media manipulation to discredit Ukrainian government officials (Roache et al. 2022). In Hungary, traditional billboards were used to equate the sanctions against Russia to armed attacks and styling them as excessive (Tidey 2022). This is an example that ‘traditional' influence is still present, despite the move to the digital environment.",
    "Certain themes were again present, particularly accusations of Nazism. However, some claims had been taken too far, prompting President Putin to make an apology (Bella, Hendrix & Ilyushin 2022). However, the symbols painted on Russian military vehicles gained their own status, akin to the Nazi use of the swastika. The various symbols caused much speculation, but one in particular, ‘Z', has become a symbol for the Russian aggression and is seen as a pro-war symbol (Mackintosh 2022). This association has led some organisations to change their logos and some European countries to ban the public display of the symbol, although these moves have also been used to make claims of Russophobia (Tengjun 2022).\n\nA difference between 2014 and 2022 is that Ukraine had a fledgling government when Crimea was annexed it just having ousted the pro-Russian government; in 2022, the government was more stable and had years of experience dealing with disinformation and the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Zelensky's repeated presentations at national forums calling for assistance and sanctions aided in providing an almost unified front against Russia. The Ukrainian propaganda portraying heroism was particularly successful and the overall influence of the propaganda effort was key to keep the flow of funding and weapons as well as the sanctions in place (Meakin 2022). By contrast, the Russian propaganda effort appeared to be thinly disguised distraction and dismissal to Western audiences, often making false claims against Ukraine or the U.S. (such as that they were using dirty bombs or counter-accusations of war crimes), continuing the 4Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay) seen in previous iterations of the boarder conflict. While there was more international engagement, such as speeches by Minister Lavrov which were met by walkouts (Euronews 2022). However, the walkouts could be presented to the Russian population as evidence of a hostile West, and the speeches could be aimed at the Russian population rather than the immediate audience. The Russian internal-facing propaganda appeared to be somewhat effective, with many Russians not believing there was a war in Ukraine and then later believing that Russia could win (Dixon 2022).\n\n## Other areas of IW\n\nThis section focuses on the reports of intelligence and electronic warfare activities during the conflict. A notable aspect was proactive intelligence disclosures by the U.S. predicting the invasion and the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines (Beebe & Lieven 2022; Bertrand & Lillis 2022). The increasingly important role of open-source intelligence that was reinforced by the Russian invasion is highlighted by Wait (2022a), where valuable information could be obtained from the Internet and social media in particular, and collectives of investigative journalists were able to aid in providing attribution.\n\nFor EW, there were reports that flights from Estonia to Finland had to return due to GPS interference, which had also been detected along the Finland-Russian border (Gatlan 2022a). The Starlink satellite systems provided to Ukraine reportedly experienced jamming; however, it was claimed that this was resolved after a software update (Insinna 2022). Russian media reported that a NATO drone had been jammed over the Black Sea (Carbonaro 2022). While both sides have used EW, indications are that the Russian use has improved since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular its EW units are now learning to counter NATO equipment that has been supplied to Ukraine (Clark 2022; Demarest 2022). The Ukrainian government urged citizens to aid the military by disrupting Russian support units, with communications and EW units being emphasised as a target (Starr 2022); this may be an indication that the Russian EW was having an impact on the",
    "battlefield. The EW in the conflict is being used to inform the U.S. military's planning; in addition, Russian EW equipment found abandoned will probably provide useful intelligence (Clark 2022; Demarest 2022).\n\n## Discussion\n\nFrom the descriptions above, IW has had an important role to play in the conflicts in Ukraine. While in some aspects there are new activities, others have remained constant or have shown gradual evolution.\n\nSome of the key differences from 2014 to 2022 include multinational support, both through organisations and official representation, that has aided Ukraine in the 2022 conflict. This extends beyond the financing and weapons delivery, but includes active support in the cyber domain, with foreign intelligence services admitting to conducting operations to bolster the defence of Ukraine's cyberspace. These include the deployment of forward-hunting operations to aid in disabling hostile cyberoperations; however, these will also prove useful in gathering intelligence on Russian cyber capabilities.\n\nThe use of wiper malware, being more destructive and targeting infrastructure, as well as hack and leak operations are new tactics in the cyber domain, even though the use of DDoS and website defacements were still prevalent. There appeared to be increased targeting of industrial systems, including satellite communications. While there were incidents between the two major stages of armed conflict, these may have been in preparation for a major military incursion into Ukraine. The number of attempts against Ukrainian power utilities, although largely foiled from causing widespread outages, indicates that this may have been part of a strategy to force the Ukrainian population into submission and to hasten a military conquest of the country. It is possible that there was an over-reliance on these aspects, and, when they failed, the troops on the ground met much stiffer resistance than expected.\n\nThe potential for increased cyber operations resulted in more attention to the environment, and active tracking of reported incidents by the CyberPeace Institute (2022b), giving a detailed record of alleged incidents. This has given more insight into the use of cyber operations than during any prior political crisis or conflict. In addition, open calls by the Ukrainian government for a ‘volunteer cyber army' represented the first time a nation has publicly encouraged civilians to engage in hostile cyber activity against another nation on such a scale. This will have contributed to the increased cyber activity, but also raises several questions which, until that point, had been rhetorical: how would civilians engaging in cyber operations against a state during a time of armed conflict be classified, and what measure can be taken against them in order to protect critical systems?\n\nDisinformation and influence operations played a role from 2014 through 2022. A difference was that the current Ukrainian government had been in place when the conflict started, and had more experience dealing with influence campaigns than the government that had just taken office in 2014. This has shown in the way the Ukrainian government, led by President Zelensky, has engaged with other world leaders to solidify support for its war efforts.\n\nLeading up to the Russian invasion in 2022, unprecedented proactive intelligence disclosures were made warning of the impending invasion, and subsequently for the attacks on the Nordstream pipelines. However, similar attempts were made by Russia which were received as falsehoods in",
    "that the same accusations were levelled against Russia. This may change the nature of intelligence sharing and make intelligence more open source.\n\nDespite some differences and new techniques and tactics, there are similarities from 2014 to 2022. Hacktivist involvement, website defacement, and DDoS attacks are ever-present factors. Cyber operations were coordinated with physical operations; however, there seems to be an evolution to include new targets and methods as discussed above. In both 2014 and 2022, observers commented that they thought cyber operations would play a larger role than what materialised; however, the number of cyber incidents has grown significantly. The prevailing theory, which is supported by evidence, is that cyber operations are more suitable for use outside of open armed conflict, and that what did occur in 2022 had limited military tactical benefit, as indicated by van der Waag-Cowling, van Niekerk, and Ramluckan (2022). The opposing view was that the heightened preparedness and international support blunted the impact of the initial aggressive cyber operations.\n\nIn the cognitive domain, similar narratives for disinformation and influence operations were prevalent, and similar tactics remained from 2014 through 2022. On the intelligence front, the role of open source intelligence, fuelled in part by social media remained; however, this is evolving to become more prevalent, as posited by van Niekerk (2015).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nInformation warfare has played a significant part in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, since the Maidan uprisings overthrowing the pro-Russian Ukrainian government, through the annexation of Crimea, the separatist movements in the East, up to and including the 2022 Russo-Ukraine conflict. This history provides a particularly useful case study to investigate how IW has evolved (and remained the same) over the eight-year period.\n\nSome new tactics, particularly in the cyber domain—such as wipers and infrastructure attacks—emerged in 2022 compared to 2014; however, between 2015 and 2017, these appeared to have been tested. International support aided in the Ukrainian war effort, including forward-hunting teams for cyber defence and proactive intelligence disclosures. Electronic warfare use appeared to remain constant throughout. Disinformation and influence operations also remained constant, as did some of the major narratives; however, in 2022, this was a more contested space, compared to 2014.\n\nWhile the future remains uncertain, cyber operations may not play a major role on the battlefield for the foreseeable future; however, the quantity and intensity of cyber operations due to conflict and particularly immediately preceding conflict may continue to grow, as is evidenced from what happened between 2014 and 2022. Similarly, disinformation and influence operations are likely to intensify with some evolution. Intelligence may show the largest evolution going forward, with more open releases and greater use of open sources, given the pervasive connectivity of devices and information posted on social media.\n\n## References\n\nAntoniuk, D 2022, ‘Cyberattack disrupts Bulgarian government websites over “betrayal to Russia”', The Record, 18 October, viewed 19 October 2022, <https://therecord.media/cyberattack-disrupts-bulgarian-government-websites-over-betrayal-to-russia/>.\n\n##",

    "abstract": "In January 2022, Russian forces began building up on the Ukrainian border prior to entering Ukraine in what was termed a 'special military operation' in support of ethnic Russians. In the ten months of conflict, there has been a range of information warfare tactics deployed, most notably disinformation and cyber operations. Ukraine is a particularly useful case study due to the ongoing tensions and low-intensity conflict, since the social media-led uprisings and annexation of Crimea in 2014. This article conducts an analysis of the information warfare in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, and contrasts this to prior operations to illustrate the evolution, limitations, and possible future of information warfare during a kinetic conflict.",
