INTRODUCTION\n\nApproximately ninety-two cyberattacks will occur during the time it takes to read this article. A University of Maryland study found that, on average, there is one cyberattack every thirty-nine seconds around the world.² This haunting statistic puts into perspective the magnitude of international cybercrime. It explains why 156 nations, including the United States, Russia, China, and Iran, have taken measures to combat the ever-increasing problem of cybercrime.³ What happens, however, when nations perpetuate cybercrime against other nations? These so-called cross-border, aggressive, state-sponsored cyberattacks are an increasing international problem. Since 2005, there have been at least 247 cyberattacks sponsored by China, 174 by Russia, 97 by Iran, and\n\n1.

It is apparent that the laws of the United Nations' (\"UN\") Charter are insufficient to address cyberattacks. The international arena must devote its efforts to working on an International Cyber Treaty (\"Cyber Treaty\") that addresses state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Cyber Treaty should clarify conflicting standards and fill gaps in current international law. This comment examines the feasibility of the Cyber Treaty considering the key players' conflicting interests.\n\nPart II addresses the *jus ad bellum* principles of international law: UN Charter Articles 2(4) and 51 and their applicability to cyber-attacks. Part III examines the Russian-sponsored 2007 Estonia Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\") Attack and its applicability to the laws of war. Part IV highlights the intersection between cybersecurity and outer space, including the increasing concern for satellite cyberattacks. Moreover, this Part discusses the differences and similarities between the legal instruments of space law and cyber law. Part V proposes an International Cyber Treaty that fills in the gaps left by applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n\n## II. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ATTACKS\n\n### A.

The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations10 (“Tallinn Manual” or “Manual”) defines *jus ad bellum* as “international law governing a State’s resort to force as an instrument of its national policy.”11 Plainly stated, this principle lays out the circumstances under which states could permissibly go to war. The core of *jus ad bellum* lies in the general prohibition against states using force on one another, found in Article 2(4), coupled with two exceptions in Articles 39 and 51. Working together with *jus ad bellum* is the international law principle of *jus in bello*, which governs a state’s conduct once already engaged in war.12 Applying *jus in bello* to cyberattacks is also a complex discussion topic that has earned scholars’ attention. This comment, however, focuses on applying *jus ad bellum* only to cyberattacks.\n\n## 1.

Before diving into the different interpretations of the word \"force,\" it is helpful to understand the historical events that led to the adoption of Article 2(4). The core of Article 2(4) traces back to the end of World War I when the League of Nations declared that \"any war or threat of war\" was of concern to the world.15 The development of Article 2(4) continued with the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which condemned states resorting to war and ended in 1945 with the formal signing of the UN Charter, formally establishing the UN and articulating Article 2(4).16 The events leading up to the formal recitation of Article 2(4) include the two World Wars, which along with the UN's aim \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\"17 suggests a focus on the use of force by way of military instruments.18 This determination also paves the way for the dominant view that Article 2(4) prohibits physical armed force only, as opposed to, for example, force as coercion.19\n\nIt is generally accepted and historically understood that force under Article 2(4) requires \"armed force.\"20 In support of this view, the UN Charter's preamble states that \"armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.\"21 In addition, Article 51\n\n13.

Exceptions to Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force\n\nArticle 2(4)'s prohibition on the use of force is subject to two exceptions: force may be allowed if the UN Security Council determines such force is needed to restore the peace²⁴ and if a state is acting in self-defense.²⁵ Article 51 codifies the latter exception providing that:\n\n[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.²⁶\n\nThe UN left the term \"armed attack\" undefined, which leads to competing interpretations of the term's intended meaning.²⁷ What is clear from Article 51 is that the right of self-defense is based on principles of necessity and proportionality.²⁸ A state's use of force under Article 2(4) might be legitimate under Article 51 only if there was an armed attack before the claim of self-defense, meaning Article 51 does not protect preemptive state attacks.²⁹\n\n## B.

In fact, the International Court of Justice declared that Articles 2(4) and 51 “appl[y] to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed” in their analysis of whether the use of nuclear weapons constituted force.⁴¹ As such, the inquiry is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies to cyberattacks but *how* to successfully apply these traditional law principles to this non-traditional weapon. The difficulty of applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks lies in the attacks’ nature.⁴² Cyberattacks are virtual, complex, anonymous, and can cause catastrophic injury to millions, potentially billions, of people, with some simple lines of code.⁴³ The unique features of cyberattacks pose difficulties when applying the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack,” leading to the conclusion that the current laws of war may be insufficient to confront this problem.⁴⁴\n\n1.  Threat or Use of Force Revisited\n\nConcerning force under Article 2(4), the primary consideration is whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force required under the traditional definition. There are six helpful factors to determine whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force.⁴⁵ These factors are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness,\n\nand-international-law-in-the-21st-century); Kersti Kaljulaid, Former President of the Republic of Estonia, Remarks at the Opening of CyCon 2019 (May 29, 2019) (stating “[w]e believe and state that both the rights and obligations of international law, including those stated in the U.N.

On the other hand, a cyberattack on a university network designed to disrupt military research on campus would not rise to the level of armed force under these factors.⁴⁸ The low severity of the university attack, coupled with minimal consequences, fails to “resemble that characteristic of uses of armed force.”⁴⁹\n\n## 2. Exceptions to the Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Revisited\n\nLikewise, Article 51 also begs the question of whether a cyberattack rises to the level of an armed attack required for a state to enjoy the right of self-defense. Article 51 is seemingly narrower than Article 2(4), meaning that not all uses of force qualify as armed attacks.⁵⁰ There are three factors to consider whether a cyberattack constitutes an “armed attack.”⁵¹ These factors include the consequences of the attack, the state’s consideration of aggressive intent, and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack.⁵² Consistent with the meaning of armed force under Article 2(4), the consequences of an armed attack must rise to a certain level in severity for a state to be justified in using self-defense.⁵³ Using these factors, a severe DDoS attack against the United States that cripples infrastructure would be considered armed force due to the severity.⁵⁴ In this scenario, the United States can respond with an armed force to defend itself, granted it abides by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and the attack can be attributed to a state actor.⁵⁵ A state’s right to use\n\n46.

Application of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks is Insufficient\n\nWhile it is possible to apply *jus ad bellum* to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient to regulate cyberattacks due to the traditional interpretation of the laws. One of the most significant difficulties in applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks is that the traditional definition of “armed force” focuses on force carried out physically and having a physical effect, such as a conventional bomb.⁵⁶ This interpretation would be too narrow for cyberattacks, considering the non-physical nature of cyberattacks. Although a cyberattack may trigger a physical reaction, much of the concern regarding cyberattacks surrounds a state’s loss or destruction of data.⁵⁷ Second, even using the more expansive definitions of *force* that focus on the attack’s consequences presented by Schmitt and the Tallinn Manual, the threshold for these factors is unclear. For example, the Estonia DDoS attack⁵⁸ merely caused confusion and unrest, even though the attack was on Estonia’s infrastructure.⁵⁹ Under Schmitt’s and the Manual’s framework, would the Estonia cyberattack rise to the level of armed force, even though its consequences were minimal and trivial?⁶⁰ The answer is unclear, considering the ambiguous definitions and traditional understanding of “armed force.” Even using broad interpretations of “force,” many ambiguities surround applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks.\n\nApplying Article 51 to cyberattacks is also problematic due to the issue of attribution. Attribution is a crucial step to claims of self-defense under Article 51.⁶¹ A state must know the perpetrator’s identity to retaliate under Article 51.⁶² Cyberattacks are distinguishable from conventional attacks because there are no soldiers, physical presence, or weapons to determine the\n\n56.

However, what if a state believes it knows which state launched the attack? Under the current laws of war, nothing prevents a state from using the right of self-defense in this scenario.⁶⁶ It is unclear if a state would be justified in launching a retaliatory armed attack if it was mistaken as to the attacker's identity.\n\nAlong these lines of retaliation, the type of force a state may use in retaliation is also ambiguous. Using the example of the severe DDoS attack against the U.S., the question is: Provided the U.S. knows which state perpetuated the attack, could the U.S. launch its own attack against the state and cripple that state's infrastructure? The U.S. would be bound to retaliate using another \"pure cyberattack\" (meaning no physical effect), considering the principles of necessity and proportionality.⁶⁷ However, what if, for some reason, a \"pure cyberattack\" was not a viable option for the U.S.? Could the U.S. respond with physical force, or must it forego its right of self-defense? Once again, the current laws of war do not answer this question.\n\nAnother problematic element of the laws of war is that non-state actors cannot violate Article 2(4) because it applies only to state actors.⁶⁸ It is common practice for governments to contract individuals or groups of hackers to attack states.⁶⁹ If a non-state actor carries out a cyberattack, the attacked state cannot enjoy the right of self-defense under Article 51. In addition, under the current principles of jus ad bellum, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda may launch cyberattacks against states with (in theory) no retaliation since al-Qaeda is not a state actor.

CROSS-BORDER AGGRESSIVE CYBERATTACKS BETWEEN STATE ACTORS\n\n### A. Estonia DDoS Attack\n\nIn 2007, Estonia became the first victim of a cyberattack sponsored by a state actor.70 The cyberattacks were in response to the Estonian government's choice to relocate a Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn.71 The type of attack utilized was the Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\"), one of the most commonly used cyberattacks.72 DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a site with fake requests to the point that the site cannot respond to all requests, and subsequently, the site crashes.73 The DDoS attacks targeted the Estonian \"government and parliamentary portals, ministries, news outlets, internet service providers, major banks, and small businesses.\"74 These attacks profoundly affected Estonia's infrastructure due to the state's heavy reliance on the Internet.75 This tiny nation, dubbed e-Estonia, is at the forefront of e-democracy76 and is recognized as the world's most advanced digital society.77 The sites of the two biggest Estonian banks were offline for about forty-five to ninety minutes, blocking access to simple financial tasks such as accessing or transferring money.78 Also, the\n\n70.

However, there is information available to suggest that Russia could have been at least indirectly responsible for the attacks.⁸⁰ Evidence of Russian responsibility included IP addresses tracing back to the computers of Russian government agencies, the Russian government's refusal to assist the Estonian government in resolving the attacks,⁸¹ and DDoS online attack instructions written in Russian.⁸² Furthermore, Russia severed commercially important railways with no prior notice for alleged repairs during the attacks.⁸³ While the Russian government completely denies responsibility,⁸⁴ the overwhelming evidence points to some Russian government orchestration, especially considering the funding needed for such attacks.⁸⁵ However, since no \"smoking gun\" proves Russian government involvement, it is difficult to attribute the attack to Russia properly.

Michael Schmitt applies his “use of force” framework and concludes that the Estonian cyberattacks rose to the level of “armed force.”88 Schmitt cites the severe consequences of the attack, such as the disruption of government function and services, economic turmoil, and adverse effects on the Estonian people.89 Likewise, Schmitt reasons the attacks were immediate, direct, invasive, and presumably illegitimate.90 Schmitt concedes there is difficulty quantifying the consequences of the cyberattack as the only factor opposing the conclusion. Balancing all the elements, Schmitt concludes, “the incident arguably reached the use-of-force threshold.”91\n\nInterestingly, Reese Nguyen comes to the opposite conclusion using this same framework on the Estonian cyberattacks.92 Nguyen claims (1) the cyberattacks were not that severe due to lack of injury and destruction; (2) the consequences were delayed; (3) the effects were not directly tied to the DDoS attacks; (4) there was minimal invasion due to the remote execution of the cyberattacks; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify; and (6) since the attacks were legitimate because they were limited to telecommunication systems.93 Using the same (widely accepted94) framework to determine whether a cyberattack amounts to the “use of force” and reaching contradictory conclusions exposes the inadequacy of applying jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the contradictory framework of Article 2(4), applying Article 51 to the Estonian cyberattacks would also be problematic. Since the cyberattacks were not adequately attributed to Russia, Estonia could not use the right of self-defense outlined in Article 51. Even more problematic is that the cyberattacks against Estonia were carried out by non-state actors, meaning Articles 2(4) and 51 would not apply to them.\n\n88. Michael N.

Applying Article 51’s use of self-defense might not be problematic in this instance because the cyberattacks against Ukraine have already been attributed to Russia, and it is clear any further cyberattacks will also be attributed to the Russian government. The familiar problem would be applying Article 2(4). The definition of “armed force” is extremely limited and traditionally includes only physical force and effects. However, considering more modern interpretations of “armed force,” an argument could be made that the consequences of Russia’s cyberattack are not minimal. If Russia plans to ramp up its cyberwarfare, Russia may be successful at shutting down Ukraine’s electric grid as it has tried in the past. As mentioned before, the ambiguity of what constitutes “armed force” makes it difficult to apply this law.

Why is there no international treaty on cross-border cyberattacks sponsored by state actors? The answer is embedded in politics and conflicting state interests.\n\n## A. Defining Cyberattack\n\nThe first step to drafting a successful International Cyber Treaty will be defining a cyberattack. Without a cohesive, agreed-upon definition of cyberattack, it is challenging to differentiate cyberattacks from cybercrime and cyberespionage.¹⁸³ The definition of cyberattack should be specific and concise, leaving no room for interpretation. Making the definition of a cyberattack too broad may open the door for differing interpretations and further disagreements.¹⁸⁴\n\nWhile the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyberattack is a good starting point, its effect-based approach is problematic for several reasons.¹⁸⁵ First, the definition focuses on the cyberattack causing injury, death, or destruction to objects. Most cyberattacks do not cause such effects but rather result in, among other things, data loss and server disruption.¹⁸⁶ For example, the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused financial losses and general inconvenience to the public, but there was no injury, death, or destruction to objects.¹⁸⁷ Another issue with the Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattack is that it does not address the intent to cause injury, death, or destruction to objects. For instance, consider a Russian-sponsored cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, hoping to destroy it. If, for some reason, the cyberattack is not accomplished, it would not be deemed a \"cyberattack\" under the Tallinn Manual. A state actor should be held accountable for failed or uncompleted cyberattacks because the state intended to cause\n\n182. United Nations Cybercrime Treaty, ELEC.

More importantly, the definition of cyberattack should be broad enough to capture the different ways a cyberattack can be carried out but also specific enough not to leave room for differing interpretations.\n\n## B. Clear Attribution and Defense Guidelines\n\nAttribution is deemed to be the most challenging aspect of cyberattacks.¹⁸⁸ The Cyber Treaty must establish elements needed to attribute a cyberattack to the wrongdoing state. Along with the elements of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should outline the evidence a state must present to prove attribution. Evidence may include IP addresses, information from political sources, similarities to malware with known actors, the temporal proximity of similar cyberattacks, and using a “honeypot” to identify actors.¹⁸⁹ With these guidelines in place, states should no longer be able to shift responsibility to groups or individuals hired to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹⁰\n\nMoreover, attribution is crucial for a state’s legitimate claim of self-defense.¹⁹¹ Accordingly, the Cyber Treaty should outline how a state may defend itself in a cyberattack. It is important to clarify what kind of attack a state may retaliate with, whether purely cyber or a mixed attack. These guidelines should still be in accordance with the international principles of necessity and proportionality discussed previously.\n\n## C. Inclusion of Non-State Actors\n\nAlong the same lines of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should encompass the actions of non-state actors as cyberattacks. The laws of war do not apply to non-state actors, which is problematic when states employ groups or individuals to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹² It is hypothesized that non-state actors could violate the laws of war if a “clear relationship” exists with a state.\n\n---\n\n¹⁸⁸.

Using the 2007 Estonia DDoS cyberattacks as an example, there is definitive proof of Russian government involvement, but is this enough to form a \"clear relationship\"? The Russian government certainly does not think so,¹⁹⁴ which is why this framework is not very useful.\n\nInstead, the Cyber Treaty should focus on state responsibility for the actions of non-state actors. First and foremost, a cyberattack must be considered state conduct if a state sponsors a cyberattack. More importantly, states should be held responsible for the acts of non-actors, especially when states knowingly allow \"its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"¹⁹⁵ Such a rule would hold states like Russia responsible for the acts of Russian hackers that carry out thousands of cyberattacks.¹⁹⁶ This framework would also remove the ability of states to claim plausible deniability for the actions of others because any cyberattack carried out within a state's territory would be the state's responsibility. Going further, even if there is no state involvement, the state should still be held responsible for not taking the appropriate measures to stop the attacks.\n\n## D. Possibility of an International Cyber Treaty\n\nWhile the idea of a Cyber Treaty is conceptually solid, many forces make its adoption uncertain in the real world. International politics and conflicting state interests play a vital role in the making and passing of international law.¹⁹⁷ A viable Cyber Treaty will require states with different views on cyberattacks to come together and agree on its terms.¹⁹⁸ Although not all UN member\n\n193.

While there is no question the laws of war codified in the UN Charter apply to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient in practice. Issues arise due to the nature of cyberattacks and the traditional definitions of \"force\" and \"armed attack.\" Moreover, there is difficulty in applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks due to proper state attribution and the exclusion of non-state actors. These challenges can be addressed by a Cyber Treaty negotiated by the three key players: the U.S., China, and Russia. Although the cyber interests and goals of the U.S. are different from those of Russia and China, the differences should not render a Cyber Treaty impossible. Much like during the Cold War with the passing of the Outer Space Treaty, the first step is to put politics behind and realize creating a Cyber Treaty could benefit all.\n\n²²⁴. Id.\n²²⁵. Id.",

INTRODUCTION\nApproximately ninety-two cyberattacks will occur during the time it takes to read this article. A University of Maryland study found that, on average, there is one cyberattack every thirty-nine seconds around the world.² This haunting statistic puts into perspective the magnitude of international cybercrime. It explains why 156 nations, including the United States, Russia, China, and Iran, have taken measures to combat the ever-increasing problem of cybercrime.³ What happens, however, when nations perpetuate cybercrime against other nations? These so-called cross-border, aggressive, state-sponsored cyberattacks are an increasing international problem. Since 2005, there have been at least 247 cyberattacks sponsored by China, 174 by Russia, 97 by Iran, and\n1.

It is apparent that the laws of the United Nations' (\"UN\") Charter are insufficient to address cyberattacks. The international arena must devote its efforts to working on an International Cyber Treaty (\"Cyber Treaty\") that addresses state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Cyber Treaty should clarify conflicting standards and fill gaps in current international law. This comment examines the feasibility of the Cyber Treaty considering the key players' conflicting interests.\nPart II addresses the *jus ad bellum* principles of international law: UN Charter Articles 2(4) and 51 and their applicability to cyber-attacks. Part III examines the Russian-sponsored 2007 Estonia Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\") Attack and its applicability to the laws of war. Part IV highlights the intersection between cybersecurity and outer space, including the increasing concern for satellite cyberattacks. Moreover, this Part discusses the differences and similarities between the legal instruments of space law and cyber law. Part V proposes an International Cyber Treaty that fills in the gaps left by applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## II. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ATTACKS\n### A.

The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations10 (“Tallinn Manual” or “Manual”) defines *jus ad bellum* as “international law governing a State’s resort to force as an instrument of its national policy.”11 Plainly stated, this principle lays out the circumstances under which states could permissibly go to war. The core of *jus ad bellum* lies in the general prohibition against states using force on one another, found in Article 2(4), coupled with two exceptions in Articles 39 and 51. Working together with *jus ad bellum* is the international law principle of *jus in bello*, which governs a state’s conduct once already engaged in war.12 Applying *jus in bello* to cyberattacks is also a complex discussion topic that has earned scholars’ attention. This comment, however, focuses on applying *jus ad bellum* only to cyberattacks.\n## 1.

Before diving into the different interpretations of the word \"force,\" it is helpful to understand the historical events that led to the adoption of Article 2(4). The core of Article 2(4) traces back to the end of World War I when the League of Nations declared that \"any war or threat of war\" was of concern to the world.15 The development of Article 2(4) continued with the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which condemned states resorting to war and ended in 1945 with the formal signing of the UN Charter, formally establishing the UN and articulating Article 2(4).16 The events leading up to the formal recitation of Article 2(4) include the two World Wars, which along with the UN's aim \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\"17 suggests a focus on the use of force by way of military instruments.18 This determination also paves the way for the dominant view that Article 2(4) prohibits physical armed force only, as opposed to, for example, force as coercion.19\nIt is generally accepted and historically understood that force under Article 2(4) requires \"armed force.\"20 In support of this view, the UN Charter's preamble states that \"armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.\"21 In addition, Article 51\n13.

Exceptions to Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force\nArticle 2(4)'s prohibition on the use of force is subject to two exceptions: force may be allowed if the UN Security Council determines such force is needed to restore the peace²⁴ and if a state is acting in self-defense.²⁵ Article 51 codifies the latter exception providing that:\n[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.²⁶\nThe UN left the term \"armed attack\" undefined, which leads to competing interpretations of the term's intended meaning.²⁷ What is clear from Article 51 is that the right of self-defense is based on principles of necessity and proportionality.²⁸ A state's use of force under Article 2(4) might be legitimate under Article 51 only if there was an armed attack before the claim of self-defense, meaning Article 51 does not protect preemptive state attacks.²⁹\n## B.

In fact, the International Court of Justice declared that Articles 2(4) and 51 “appl[y] to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed” in their analysis of whether the use of nuclear weapons constituted force.⁴¹ As such, the inquiry is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies to cyberattacks but *how* to successfully apply these traditional law principles to this non-traditional weapon. The difficulty of applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks lies in the attacks’ nature.⁴² Cyberattacks are virtual, complex, anonymous, and can cause catastrophic injury to millions, potentially billions, of people, with some simple lines of code.⁴³ The unique features of cyberattacks pose difficulties when applying the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack,” leading to the conclusion that the current laws of war may be insufficient to confront this problem.⁴⁴\n1.  Threat or Use of Force Revisited\nConcerning force under Article 2(4), the primary consideration is whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force required under the traditional definition. There are six helpful factors to determine whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force.⁴⁵ These factors are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness,\nand-international-law-in-the-21st-century); Kersti Kaljulaid, Former President of the Republic of Estonia, Remarks at the Opening of CyCon 2019 (May 29, 2019) (stating “[w]e believe and state that both the rights and obligations of international law, including those stated in the U.N.

On the other hand, a cyberattack on a university network designed to disrupt military research on campus would not rise to the level of armed force under these factors.⁴⁸ The low severity of the university attack, coupled with minimal consequences, fails to “resemble that characteristic of uses of armed force.”⁴⁹\n## 2. Exceptions to the Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Revisited\nLikewise, Article 51 also begs the question of whether a cyberattack rises to the level of an armed attack required for a state to enjoy the right of self-defense. Article 51 is seemingly narrower than Article 2(4), meaning that not all uses of force qualify as armed attacks.⁵⁰ There are three factors to consider whether a cyberattack constitutes an “armed attack.”⁵¹ These factors include the consequences of the attack, the state’s consideration of aggressive intent, and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack.⁵² Consistent with the meaning of armed force under Article 2(4), the consequences of an armed attack must rise to a certain level in severity for a state to be justified in using self-defense.⁵³ Using these factors, a severe DDoS attack against the United States that cripples infrastructure would be considered armed force due to the severity.⁵⁴ In this scenario, the United States can respond with an armed force to defend itself, granted it abides by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and the attack can be attributed to a state actor.⁵⁵ A state’s right to use\n46.

Id.\nStetson Business Law Review\n[Vol. 4.1]\narmed force after a cyberattack raises the question of what type of force it may use to defend itself, which this Comment addresses in the proceeding Section.\n## 3. Application of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks is Insufficient\nWhile it is possible to apply *jus ad bellum* to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient to regulate cyberattacks due to the traditional interpretation of the laws. One of the most significant difficulties in applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks is that the traditional definition of “armed force” focuses on force carried out physically and having a physical effect, such as a conventional bomb.⁵⁶ This interpretation would be too narrow for cyberattacks, considering the non-physical nature of cyberattacks. Although a cyberattack may trigger a physical reaction, much of the concern regarding cyberattacks surrounds a state’s loss or destruction of data.⁵⁷ Second, even using the more expansive definitions of *force* that focus on the attack’s consequences presented by Schmitt and the Tallinn Manual, the threshold for these factors is unclear. For example, the Estonia DDoS attack⁵⁸ merely caused confusion and unrest, even though the attack was on Estonia’s infrastructure.⁵⁹ Under Schmitt’s and the Manual’s framework, would the Estonia cyberattack rise to the level of armed force, even though its consequences were minimal and trivial?⁶⁰ The answer is unclear, considering the ambiguous definitions and traditional understanding of “armed force.” Even using broad interpretations of “force,” many ambiguities surround applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks.\nApplying Article 51 to cyberattacks is also problematic due to the issue of attribution. Attribution is a crucial step to claims of self-defense under Article 51.⁶¹ A state must know the perpetrator’s identity to retaliate under Article 51.⁶² Cyberattacks are distinguishable from conventional attacks because there are no soldiers, physical presence, or weapons to determine the\n56.

Id.\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n179\nattacker.⁶³ In fact, perpetrators of cyberattacks actively disguise their identities by altering IP addresses.⁶⁴ Even more dangerous is that a state may launch a cyberattack under the guise of originating from another state, effectively masking its identity and potentially instigating a retaliatory armed attack against the wrong state.⁶⁵ A state should not utilize Article 51's right to self-defense if it cannot determine where the cyberattack originated. However, what if a state believes it knows which state launched the attack? Under the current laws of war, nothing prevents a state from using the right of self-defense in this scenario.⁶⁶ It is unclear if a state would be justified in launching a retaliatory armed attack if it was mistaken as to the attacker's identity.\nAlong these lines of retaliation, the type of force a state may use in retaliation is also ambiguous. Using the example of the severe DDoS attack against the U.S., the question is: Provided the U.S. knows which state perpetuated the attack, could the U.S. launch its own attack against the state and cripple that state's infrastructure? The U.S. would be bound to retaliate using another \"pure cyberattack\" (meaning no physical effect), considering the principles of necessity and proportionality.⁶⁷ However, what if, for some reason, a \"pure cyberattack\" was not a viable option for the U.S.? Could the U.S. respond with physical force, or must it forego its right of self-defense? Once again, the current laws of war do not answer this question.\nAnother problematic element of the laws of war is that non-state actors cannot violate Article 2(4) because it applies only to state actors.⁶⁸ It is common practice for governments to contract individuals or groups of hackers to attack states.⁶⁹ If a non-state actor carries out a cyberattack, the attacked state cannot enjoy the right of self-defense under Article 51. In addition, under the current principles of jus ad bellum, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda may launch cyberattacks against states with (in theory) no retaliation since al-Qaeda is not a state actor.

CROSS-BORDER AGGRESSIVE CYBERATTACKS BETWEEN STATE ACTORS\n### A. Estonia DDoS Attack\nIn 2007, Estonia became the first victim of a cyberattack sponsored by a state actor.70 The cyberattacks were in response to the Estonian government's choice to relocate a Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn.71 The type of attack utilized was the Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\"), one of the most commonly used cyberattacks.72 DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a site with fake requests to the point that the site cannot respond to all requests, and subsequently, the site crashes.73 The DDoS attacks targeted the Estonian \"government and parliamentary portals, ministries, news outlets, internet service providers, major banks, and small businesses.\"74 These attacks profoundly affected Estonia's infrastructure due to the state's heavy reliance on the Internet.75 This tiny nation, dubbed e-Estonia, is at the forefront of e-democracy76 and is recognized as the world's most advanced digital society.77 The sites of the two biggest Estonian banks were offline for about forty-five to ninety minutes, blocking access to simple financial tasks such as accessing or transferring money.78 Also, the\n70.

However, there is information available to suggest that Russia could have been at least indirectly responsible for the attacks.⁸⁰ Evidence of Russian responsibility included IP addresses tracing back to the computers of Russian government agencies, the Russian government's refusal to assist the Estonian government in resolving the attacks,⁸¹ and DDoS online attack instructions written in Russian.⁸² Furthermore, Russia severed commercially important railways with no prior notice for alleged repairs during the attacks.⁸³ While the Russian government completely denies responsibility,⁸⁴ the overwhelming evidence points to some Russian government orchestration, especially considering the funding needed for such attacks.⁸⁵ However, since no \"smoking gun\" proves Russian government involvement, it is difficult to attribute the attack to Russia properly. There was, however, one conviction in connection with the cyberattacks. Dmitri Galuškevits, an Estonian student of Russian origin, was convicted for targeting a political party's website.⁸⁶ The size of the operation suggests many others were responsible for the attacks, however, due to Russia's non-cooperation, the rest remain without any repercussions.⁸⁷\n1.

Michael Schmitt applies his “use of force” framework and concludes that the Estonian cyberattacks rose to the level of “armed force.”88 Schmitt cites the severe consequences of the attack, such as the disruption of government function and services, economic turmoil, and adverse effects on the Estonian people.89 Likewise, Schmitt reasons the attacks were immediate, direct, invasive, and presumably illegitimate.90 Schmitt concedes there is difficulty quantifying the consequences of the cyberattack as the only factor opposing the conclusion. Balancing all the elements, Schmitt concludes, “the incident arguably reached the use-of-force threshold.”91\nInterestingly, Reese Nguyen comes to the opposite conclusion using this same framework on the Estonian cyberattacks.92 Nguyen claims (1) the cyberattacks were not that severe due to lack of injury and destruction; (2) the consequences were delayed; (3) the effects were not directly tied to the DDoS attacks; (4) there was minimal invasion due to the remote execution of the cyberattacks; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify; and (6) since the attacks were legitimate because they were limited to telecommunication systems.93 Using the same (widely accepted94) framework to determine whether a cyberattack amounts to the “use of force” and reaching contradictory conclusions exposes the inadequacy of applying jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the contradictory framework of Article 2(4), applying Article 51 to the Estonian cyberattacks would also be problematic. Since the cyberattacks were not adequately attributed to Russia, Estonia could not use the right of self-defense outlined in Article 51. Even more problematic is that the cyberattacks against Estonia were carried out by non-state actors, meaning Articles 2(4) and 51 would not apply to them.\n88. Michael N.

NATO Article 5\nAnother aspect of this cyberattack is the implication of NATO Article 5,⁹⁵ which would evoke a collective defensive response against Russia from NATO members.⁹⁶ Some experts speculate that the Russian government purposefully fell short of the threshold for invoking Article 5 due to the severe repercussions it may face from NATO's collective defense.⁹⁷ While Article 5 was not invoked in the Estonia cyberattacks, it is clear that NATO will defend its allies against a cyberattack.⁹⁸ Article 5 serves as another layer of defense for NATO countries against serious cyberattacks, a resource that should be used more often.\n## B. Cyberattacks Between Russia and Ukraine\nWhile there is a physical war between Russian and Ukraine,⁹⁹ the battle is also occurring in cyberspace. Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine began as early as 2014.¹⁰⁰ Three days before the referendum vote on the status of Crimea, Russia launched an eight-minute DDoS cyberattack against Ukraine to \"destabilize communications and spread confusion whilst troops overran the region.\"¹⁰¹ Also in 2014, a pro-Russian hacking group carried out cyberattacks to manipulate voting in the Ukrainian presidential election.¹⁰² The hackers targeted the Central Election Commission in an attempt to change election results.¹⁰³ More notably, in 2015 Russia carried out another DDoS attack that affected energy\n95.

Applying Article 51’s use of self-defense might not be problematic in this instance because the cyberattacks against Ukraine have already been attributed to Russia, and it is clear any further cyberattacks will also be attributed to the Russian government. The familiar problem would be applying Article 2(4). The definition of “armed force” is extremely limited and traditionally includes only physical force and effects. However, considering more modern interpretations of “armed force,” an argument could be made that the consequences of Russia’s cyberattack are not minimal. If Russia plans to ramp up its cyberwarfare, Russia may be successful at shutting down Ukraine’s electric grid as it has tried in the past. As mentioned before, the ambiguity of what constitutes “armed force” makes it difficult to apply this law. However, an attack of this magnitude may be enough to trigger Article 2(4), regardless of any physical destruction.\n¹¹⁵. Brumfield, supra note 109.\n¹¹⁶.

Threats from China and Iran\n### 1. China\nIn its 2023 Annual Threat Assessment, U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) opined that “China remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to the U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks.”¹²⁰ For decades, the People’s Republic of China has engaged in malicious cyberattacks against U.S. institutions, “including healthcare, financial services, defense industrial base, energy, government facilities, chemical, critical manufacturing (including automotive and aerospace), communications, IT (including managed service providers), international trade, education, video gaming, faith-based organizations, and law firms.”¹²¹ According to data from CrowdStrike, China was responsible for sixty-seven percent of state-sponsored cyberattacks “motivated both by intellectual property (IP) theft and intelligence gathering objectives” in 2021.¹²² Compared with just seven percent for the Iranian government and one percent for the Russian government, China’s stunning cyber involvement presents the biggest threat to U.S. business and government.¹²³\nChina’s malicious cyberattacks came to the forefront with Operation Aurora in January 2010.¹²⁴ Operation Aurora was a series of attacks from China that compromised many U.S. companies such as Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical, and Google.¹²⁵ Google was the only company to publicly come forward and announce that the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists had been compromised.¹²⁶ As a result of this attack and\n---\n¹²⁰. *People’s Republic of China Cyber Threat*, CYBERSECURITY &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE SEC.

Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin added thousands of satellites to the Earth's low orbit.¹⁵⁴ For example, SpaceX plans to send over 40,000 Starlink satellites into space to provide low-cost Internet to remote areas worldwide.¹⁵⁵ With more plans to launch satellites from SpaceX and other companies, comes more demand for building satellites cheaper and faster.¹⁵⁶ The rapid building of satellites is of increasing interest¹⁵⁷ due to the possibility of companies cutting corners to decrease costs and speed up production.¹⁵⁸ The commercial space industry boom has opened the door for more cyberattacks. There are more non-government space actors than ever, and the highly technical aspect of building satellites allows multiple manufacturers to be involved in a single satellite.¹⁵⁹ These new realities create new targets along an extensive supply chain that companies and governments are not currently equipped to handle.\n151.

Viasat KA-SAT Satellite Cyberattack\nOne example of the consequences a cyberattack may have on a satellite comes via the Viasat KA-SAT case. On February 24, 2022, the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a cyberattack was launched against Viasat's KA-SAT satellite broadband service.¹⁶⁰ The cyberattack impacted the internet access of tens of thousands of Ukrainian and EU citizens and severed the remote monitoring access of 5,800 wind turbines of a German energy company.¹⁶¹ The malware used to carry out the attacks is called \"AcidRain,\" designed to remotely \"wipe modems and routers.\"¹⁶² The AcidRain malware bears coding similarities with another malware previously attributed to Russia's Sandworm group.¹⁶³ This piece of evidence, along with the suspicious timing of the cyberattack, leads many to conclude Russia sponsored the cyberattack.¹⁶⁴ The U.S. formally attributed the satellite cyberattack to Russia in a press statement by the Secretary of State.¹⁶⁵ While the U.S., E.U., and other countries condemned the cyberattacks, there was no discussion of its applicability to Articles 2(4) and 51, nor NATO Article 5 repercussions.¹⁶⁶ Such inaction to punish Russia continues to set a dangerous precedent of allowing state-sponsored malicious cyberattacks.\n¹⁶⁰.

An International Cyber Treaty needs to be negotiated by the key players to codify cyber rules that benefit all, much like was done in 1967 with the Outer Space Treaty.\n## V. INTERNATIONAL CYBER TREATY\nThough it may be difficult to envision a Cyber Treaty that addresses the issues outlined in this Comment, European countries agreed to a comprehensive international cybercrime treaty in 2001.¹⁸⁰ The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”), among many other things, defines criminal offenses for cybercrime and establishes domestic procedures for prosecuting computer crimes.¹⁸¹ Moreover, the UN is working on another major Cybercrime Convention to deal with topics like international cooperation on cybercrime, law\n176.

Why is there no international treaty on cross-border cyberattacks sponsored by state actors? The answer is embedded in politics and conflicting state interests.\n## A. Defining Cyberattack\nThe first step to drafting a successful International Cyber Treaty will be defining a cyberattack. Without a cohesive, agreed-upon definition of cyberattack, it is challenging to differentiate cyberattacks from cybercrime and cyberespionage.¹⁸³ The definition of cyberattack should be specific and concise, leaving no room for interpretation. Making the definition of a cyberattack too broad may open the door for differing interpretations and further disagreements.¹⁸⁴\nWhile the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyberattack is a good starting point, its effect-based approach is problematic for several reasons.¹⁸⁵ First, the definition focuses on the cyberattack causing injury, death, or destruction to objects. Most cyberattacks do not cause such effects but rather result in, among other things, data loss and server disruption.¹⁸⁶ For example, the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused financial losses and general inconvenience to the public, but there was no injury, death, or destruction to objects.¹⁸⁷ Another issue with the Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattack is that it does not address the intent to cause injury, death, or destruction to objects. For instance, consider a Russian-sponsored cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, hoping to destroy it. If, for some reason, the cyberattack is not accomplished, it would not be deemed a \"cyberattack\" under the Tallinn Manual. A state actor should be held accountable for failed or uncompleted cyberattacks because the state intended to cause\n182. United Nations Cybercrime Treaty, ELEC.

The definition of cyberattack should include an intent element to deal with these situations. More importantly, the definition of cyberattack should be broad enough to capture the different ways a cyberattack can be carried out but also specific enough not to leave room for differing interpretations.\n## B. Clear Attribution and Defense Guidelines\nAttribution is deemed to be the most challenging aspect of cyberattacks.¹⁸⁸ The Cyber Treaty must establish elements needed to attribute a cyberattack to the wrongdoing state. Along with the elements of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should outline the evidence a state must present to prove attribution. Evidence may include IP addresses, information from political sources, similarities to malware with known actors, the temporal proximity of similar cyberattacks, and using a “honeypot” to identify actors.¹⁸⁹ With these guidelines in place, states should no longer be able to shift responsibility to groups or individuals hired to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹⁰\nMoreover, attribution is crucial for a state’s legitimate claim of self-defense.¹⁹¹ Accordingly, the Cyber Treaty should outline how a state may defend itself in a cyberattack. It is important to clarify what kind of attack a state may retaliate with, whether purely cyber or a mixed attack. These guidelines should still be in accordance with the international principles of necessity and proportionality discussed previously.\n## C. Inclusion of Non-State Actors\nAlong the same lines of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should encompass the actions of non-state actors as cyberattacks. The laws of war do not apply to non-state actors, which is problematic when states employ groups or individuals to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹² It is hypothesized that non-state actors could violate the laws of war if a “clear relationship” exists with a state.\n---\n¹⁸⁸. See Simmons, supra note 13, at 100.\n¹⁸⁹. See Nguyen, supra note 93, at 1105.\n¹⁹⁰. See discussion supra Section III.A.\n¹⁹¹. See Moore, supra note 21, at 242.\n¹⁹². See discussion supra Section II.B.3.\nStetson Business Law Review\n[Vol. 4.1]\n193 However, it is unclear what constitutes a clear relationship. Using the 2007 Estonia DDoS cyberattacks as an example, there is definitive proof of Russian government involvement, but is this enough to form a \"clear relationship\"? The Russian government certainly does not think so,¹⁹⁴ which is why this framework is not very useful.\nInstead, the Cyber Treaty should focus on state responsibility for the actions of non-state actors. First and foremost, a cyberattack must be considered state conduct if a state sponsors a cyberattack. More importantly, states should be held responsible for the acts of non-actors, especially when states knowingly allow \"its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"¹⁹⁵ Such a rule would hold states like Russia responsible for the acts of Russian hackers that carry out thousands of cyberattacks.¹⁹⁶ This framework would also remove the ability of states to claim plausible deniability for the actions of others because any cyberattack carried out within a state's territory would be the state's responsibility. Going further, even if there is no state involvement, the state should still be held responsible for not taking the appropriate measures to stop the attacks.\n## D. Possibility of an International Cyber Treaty\nWhile the idea of a Cyber Treaty is conceptually solid, many forces make its adoption uncertain in the real world. International politics and conflicting state interests play a vital role in the making and passing of international law.¹⁹⁷ A viable Cyber Treaty will require states with different views on cyberattacks to come together and agree on its terms.¹⁹⁸ Although not all UN member\n193.

Conflicting State Interests\nThe key players in the Cyber Treaty are Russia, China, and the U.S. Each state has different cyber goals. For example, Russia focuses on cyber policies that support state sovereignty and the ability to keep citizen loyalties in check.¹⁹⁹ China has similar goals as Russia and emphasizes the importance of preemptive cyberattacks.²⁰⁰ Meanwhile, the U.S. is focused on cooperation between international law enforcement agencies to stop cyberattacks and apprehend cybercriminals.²⁰¹ Despite multiple efforts by the Russian government²⁰² to reach an agreement on cyber matters with the U.S., the U.S. remains apprehensive about Russia's intentions, and with good reason.²⁰³ Although the U.S. and Russia have not agreed on most cyber issues, in 2015, Russia and China entered into a bilateral cyber treaty that pledges neither state will launch a cyberattack against the other.²⁰⁴ While this treaty only binds Russia and China, it marks a first step toward an International Cyber Treaty.

Moving Past the Politics\nRussia and the U.S. had even more significant ideological differences during the Cold War.²⁰⁶ Though cyberattacks cause catastrophic effects on the economy, infrastructure, supply chains, and more,²⁰⁷ the severity of the Cold War cannot be compared. The Cold War was not just a space race but also a nuclear arms race between the U.S. and Russia.²⁰⁸ These two nations were actively developing weapons of mass destruction and threatening each other with nuclear attacks.²⁰⁹ However, during the height of the Cold War, important agreements were reached, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere) and the Outer Space Treaty (outlawing weapons of mass destruction in outer space).²¹⁰ If the U.S. and Russia reached agreements during such tense and terrifying times, it should be possible to do the same in today's world.

The groups of note are the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security²¹⁴ and the “Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies.”²¹⁵ These groups were mandated by the U.N., among other things, to “further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States,”²¹⁶ and promote “an open, secure, stable and accessible ICT [information and communications technologies] environment.”²¹⁷\nWhile these groups are important in developing norms and guidelines for cyber matters, the drawback of the groups is in their non-binding nature. Though some nations, namely Russia, that are part of these groups work with other experts to develop these guidelines, it is clear the rules are not being followed by the member-states. While the reports serve as important guiding principles all states should follow, the reality is they are not being properly adhered to. This is another reason why a Cyber Treaty is needed. There is only so much that non-binding norms and U.N. resolutions will do in getting states to cooperate with proper cyber behavior.\n1. UN G.G.E.\nThe above-mentioned group of experts (“Experts”) on this matter consists of twenty-five members from different U.N. member countries.

In the coming years, this Group should further develop norms and rules for existing and potential cyber threats that are persuasive enough for states to follow.\n## VI. CONCLUSION\nThis Comment focused on the application of the laws of war to cyberattacks. While there is no question the laws of war codified in the UN Charter apply to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient in practice. Issues arise due to the nature of cyberattacks and the traditional definitions of \"force\" and \"armed attack.\" Moreover, there is difficulty in applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks due to proper state attribution and the exclusion of non-state actors. These challenges can be addressed by a Cyber Treaty negotiated by the three key players: the U.S., China, and Russia. Although the cyber interests and goals of the U.S. are different from those of Russia and China, the differences should not render a Cyber Treaty impossible. Much like during the Cold War with the passing of the Outer Space Treaty, the first step is to put politics behind and realize creating a Cyber Treaty could benefit all.\n²²⁴. Id.\n²²⁵.

INTRODUCTION Approximately ninety-two cyberattacks will occur during the time it takes to read this article. A University of Maryland study found that, on average, there is one cyberattack every thirty-nine seconds around the world.² This haunting statistic puts into perspective the magnitude of international cybercrime. It explains why 156 nations, including the United States, Russia, China, and Iran, have taken measures to combat the ever-increasing problem of cybercrime.³ What happens, however, when nations perpetuate cybercrime against other nations? These so-called cross-border, aggressive, state-sponsored cyberattacks are an increasing international problem. Since 2005, there have been at least 247 cyberattacks sponsored by China, 174 by Russia, 97 by Iran, and\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nThis comment examines the applicability of current international laws of war to cross-border attacks sponsored by state actors. It is apparent that the laws of the United Nations' (\"UN\") Charter are insufficient to address cyberattacks. The international arena must devote its efforts to working on an International Cyber Treaty (\"Cyber Treaty\") that addresses state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Cyber Treaty should clarify conflicting standards and fill gaps in current international law. This comment examines the feasibility of the Cyber Treaty considering the key players' conflicting interests.\nPart II addresses the *jus ad bellum* principles of international law: UN Charter Articles 2(4) and 51 and their applicability to cyber-attacks. Part III examines the Russian-sponsored 2007 Estonia Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\") Attack and its applicability to the laws of war. Part IV highlights the intersection between cybersecurity and outer space, including the increasing concern for satellite cyberattacks. Moreover, this Part discusses the differences and similarities between the legal instruments of space law and cyber law. Part V proposes an International Cyber Treaty that fills in the gaps left by applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## II. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ATTACKS ### A. Applicable International Law The UN is the most influential international organization that creates and codifies international law.⁶ The UN Charter contains Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] many significant laws, including Article 2(4),7 arguably one of the most important rules of modern international law.8 Articles 2(4) and (51)9 of the UN Charter codify the international law concept of *jus ad bellum*, which is the international law governing states going to war (“laws of war”). The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations10 (“Tallinn Manual” or “Manual”) defines *jus ad bellum* as “international law governing a State’s resort to force as an instrument of its national policy.”11 Plainly stated, this principle lays out the circumstances under which states could permissibly go to war. The core of *jus ad bellum* lies in the general prohibition against states using force on one another, found in Article 2(4), coupled with two exceptions in Articles 39 and 51. Working together with *jus ad bellum* is the international law principle of *jus in bello*, which governs a state’s conduct once already engaged in war.12 Applying *jus in bello* to cyberattacks is also a complex discussion topic that has earned scholars’ attention. This comment, however, focuses on applying *jus ad bellum* only to cyberattacks.\n## 1. Threat or Use of Force Article 2(4) of the UN Charter declares that: All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or in developing nations). But see Julia Zorthian, *5 United Nations Achievements Worth Celebrating on U.N. Day*, TIME (Oct. 23, 2015, 6:20PM), https://time.com/4085757/united-nations-achievements/. (listing major UN accomplishments including pyramid preservation, smallpox eradication, and arms control promotion).\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nThe age-old question is: What did the UN mean by\"force\"?14 The answer is, of course, it depends. Before diving into the different interpretations of the word\"force,\"it is helpful to understand the historical events that led to the adoption of Article 2(4). The core of Article 2(4) traces back to the end of World War I when the League of Nations declared that\"any war or threat of war\"was of concern to the world.15 The development of Article 2(4) continued with the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which condemned states resorting to war and ended in 1945 with the formal signing of the UN Charter, formally establishing the UN and articulating Article 2(4).16 The events leading up to the formal recitation of Article 2(4) include the two World Wars, which along with the UN's aim\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\"17 suggests a focus on the use of force by way of military instruments.18 This determination also paves the way for the dominant view that Article 2(4) prohibits physical armed force only, as opposed to, for example, force as coercion.19 It is generally accepted and historically understood that force under Article 2(4) requires\"armed force.\"20 In support of this view, the UN Charter's preamble states that\"armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.\"21 In addition, Article 51 Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] (discussed below) references self-defense against armed attacks.²² The problem with this strict interpretation is that only instances of military violence would violate Article 2(4), and states may only exercise the right of self-defense under Article 51 from armed military violence of another state.²³ ## 2. Exceptions to Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the use of force is subject to two exceptions: force may be allowed if the UN Security Council determines such force is needed to restore the peace²⁴ and if a state is acting in self-defense.²⁵ Article 51 codifies the latter exception providing that: [n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.²⁶ The UN left the term\"armed attack\"undefined, which leads to competing interpretations of the term's intended meaning.²⁷ What is clear from Article 51 is that the right of self-defense is based on principles of necessity and proportionality.²⁸ A state's use of force under Article 2(4) might be legitimate under Article 51 only if there was an armed attack before the claim of self-defense, meaning Article 51 does not protect preemptive state attacks.²⁹ ## B. Applicability and Sufficiency of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks Before applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks, it is necessary first to define a cyberattack. Starting with what a cyberattack is not, a cyberattack is not the same thing as\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nRegarding the application of Articles 2(4) and 51, there is increasing agreement among states and scholars that these rules apply to cyberattacks.³⁷ States in agreement include the United States, the United Kingdom, and Estonia.³⁸ The Tallinn Manual Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] also supports this conclusion: “[b]oth International Groups of Experts were unanimous in their estimation that existing international law applies to cyber operations.”³⁹ Difficulties arise when applying the laws of war to cyberattacks due to the traditional language of the Articles.⁴⁰ It is through no fault of their own, however, that the UN’s founders did not foresee the current modern digital world and the possibility of cyberattacks before the signing of the UN Charter in 1945. In fact, the International Court of Justice declared that Articles 2(4) and 51 “appl[y] to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed” in their analysis of whether the use of nuclear weapons constituted force.⁴¹ As such, the inquiry is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies to cyberattacks but *how* to successfully apply these traditional law principles to this non-traditional weapon. The difficulty of applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks lies in the attacks’ nature.⁴² Cyberattacks are virtual, complex, anonymous, and can cause catastrophic injury to millions, potentially billions, of people, with some simple lines of code.⁴³ The unique features of cyberattacks pose difficulties when applying the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack,” leading to the conclusion that the current laws of war may be insufficient to confront this problem.⁴⁴ Concerning force under Article 2(4), the primary consideration is whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force required under the traditional definition. There are six helpful factors to determine whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force.⁴⁵ These factors are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and-international-law-in-the-21st-century); Kersti Kaljulaid, Former President of the Republic of Estonia, Remarks at the Opening of CyCon 2019 (May 29, 2019) (stating “[w]e believe and state that both the rights and obligations of international law, including those stated in the U.N. Charter, do apply to states when using IT and communication technologies”).\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## 2. Exceptions to the Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Revisited\nLikewise, Article 51 also begs the question of whether a cyberattack rises to the level of an armed attack required for a state to enjoy the right of self-defense. Article 51 is seemingly narrower than Article 2(4), meaning that not all uses of force qualify as armed attacks.⁵⁰ There are three factors to consider whether a cyberattack constitutes an “armed attack.”⁵¹ These factors include the consequences of the attack, the state’s consideration of aggressive intent, and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack.⁵² Consistent with the meaning of armed force under Article 2(4), the consequences of an armed attack must rise to a certain level in severity for a state to be justified in using self-defense.⁵³ Using these factors, a severe DDoS attack against the United States that cripples infrastructure would be considered armed force due to the severity.⁵⁴ In this scenario, the United States can respond with an armed force to defend itself, granted it abides by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and the attack can be attributed to a state actor.⁵⁵ A state’s right to use\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] armed force after a cyberattack raises the question of what type of force it may use to defend itself, which this Comment addresses in the proceeding Section.\n## 3. Application of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks is Insufficient While it is possible to apply *jus ad bellum* to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient to regulate cyberattacks due to the traditional interpretation of the laws. One of the most significant difficulties in applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks is that the traditional definition of “armed force” focuses on force carried out physically and having a physical effect, such as a conventional bomb.⁵⁶ This interpretation would be too narrow for cyberattacks, considering the non-physical nature of cyberattacks. Although a cyberattack may trigger a physical reaction, much of the concern regarding cyberattacks surrounds a state’s loss or destruction of data.⁵⁷ Second, even using the more expansive definitions of *force* that focus on the attack’s consequences presented by Schmitt and the Tallinn Manual, the threshold for these factors is unclear. For example, the Estonia DDoS attack⁵⁸ merely caused confusion and unrest, even though the attack was on Estonia’s infrastructure.⁵⁹ Under Schmitt’s and the Manual’s framework, would the Estonia cyberattack rise to the level of armed force, even though its consequences were minimal and trivial?⁶⁰ The answer is unclear, considering the ambiguous definitions and traditional understanding of “armed force.” Even using broad interpretations of “force,” many ambiguities surround applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks.\nApplying Article 51 to cyberattacks is also problematic due to the issue of attribution. Attribution is a crucial step to claims of self-defense under Article 51.⁶¹ A state must know the perpetrator’s identity to retaliate under Article 51.⁶² Cyberattacks are distinguishable from conventional attacks because there are no soldiers, physical presence, or weapons to determine the\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nAlong these lines of retaliation, the type of force a state may use in retaliation is also ambiguous. Using the example of the severe DDoS attack against the U.S., the question is: Provided the U.S. knows which state perpetuated the attack, could the U.S. launch its own attack against the state and cripple that state's infrastructure? The U.S. would be bound to retaliate using another\"pure cyberattack\"(meaning no physical effect), considering the principles of necessity and proportionality.⁶⁷ However, what if, for some reason, a\"pure cyberattack\"was not a viable option for the U.S.? Could the U.S. respond with physical force, or must it forego its right of self-defense? Once again, the current laws of war do not answer this question.\nAnother problematic element of the laws of war is that non-state actors cannot violate Article 2(4) because it applies only to state actors.⁶⁸ It is common practice for governments to contract individuals or groups of hackers to attack states.⁶⁹ If a non-state actor carries out a cyberattack, the attacked state cannot enjoy the right of self-defense under Article 51. In addition, under the current principles of jus ad bellum, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda may launch cyberattacks against states with (in theory) no retaliation since al-Qaeda is not a state actor. Once again, this Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] appears to be the wrong conclusion, especially considering the large number of non-state actors that launch cyberattacks.\n## III. CROSS-BORDER AGGRESSIVE CYBERATTACKS BETWEEN STATE ACTORS ### A. Estonia DDoS Attack In 2007, Estonia became the first victim of a cyberattack sponsored by a state actor.70 The cyberattacks were in response to the Estonian government's choice to relocate a Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn.71 The type of attack utilized was the Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\"), one of the most commonly used cyberattacks.72 DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a site with fake requests to the point that the site cannot respond to all requests, and subsequently, the site crashes.73 The DDoS attacks targeted the Estonian\"government and parliamentary portals, ministries, news outlets, internet service providers, major banks, and small businesses.\"74 These attacks profoundly affected Estonia's infrastructure due to the state's heavy reliance on the Internet.75 This tiny nation, dubbed e-Estonia, is at the forefront of e-democracy76 and is recognized as the world's most advanced digital society.77 The sites of the two biggest Estonian banks were offline for about forty-five to ninety minutes, blocking access to simple financial tasks such as accessing or transferring money.78 Also, the\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nRegarding responsibility, no concrete evidence exists attributing the cyberattack to a state. However, there is information available to suggest that Russia could have been at least indirectly responsible for the attacks.⁸⁰ Evidence of Russian responsibility included IP addresses tracing back to the computers of Russian government agencies, the Russian government's refusal to assist the Estonian government in resolving the attacks,⁸¹ and DDoS online attack instructions written in Russian.⁸² Furthermore, Russia severed commercially important railways with no prior notice for alleged repairs during the attacks.⁸³ While the Russian government completely denies responsibility,⁸⁴ the overwhelming evidence points to some Russian government orchestration, especially considering the funding needed for such attacks.⁸⁵ However, since no\"smoking gun\"proves Russian government involvement, it is difficult to attribute the attack to Russia properly. There was, however, one conviction in connection with the cyberattacks. Dmitri Galuškevits, an Estonian student of Russian origin, was convicted for targeting a political party's website.⁸⁶ The size of the operation suggests many others were responsible for the attacks, however, due to Russia's non-cooperation, the rest remain without any repercussions.⁸⁷ Applying the laws of war to the Estonian cyberattacks yields contradicting results, showing exactly why another solution is Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] needed. Michael Schmitt applies his “use of force” framework and concludes that the Estonian cyberattacks rose to the level of “armed force.”88 Schmitt cites the severe consequences of the attack, such as the disruption of government function and services, economic turmoil, and adverse effects on the Estonian people.89 Likewise, Schmitt reasons the attacks were immediate, direct, invasive, and presumably illegitimate.90 Schmitt concedes there is difficulty quantifying the consequences of the cyberattack as the only factor opposing the conclusion. Balancing all the elements, Schmitt concludes, “the incident arguably reached the use-of-force threshold.”91 Interestingly, Reese Nguyen comes to the opposite conclusion using this same framework on the Estonian cyberattacks.92 Nguyen claims (1) the cyberattacks were not that severe due to lack of injury and destruction; (2) the consequences were delayed; (3) the effects were not directly tied to the DDoS attacks; (4) there was minimal invasion due to the remote execution of the cyberattacks; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify; and (6) since the attacks were legitimate because they were limited to telecommunication systems.93 Using the same (widely accepted94) framework to determine whether a cyberattack amounts to the “use of force” and reaching contradictory conclusions exposes the inadequacy of applying jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the contradictory framework of Article 2(4), applying Article 51 to the Estonian cyberattacks would also be problematic. Since the cyberattacks were not adequately attributed to Russia, Estonia could not use the right of self-defense outlined in Article 51. Even more problematic is that the cyberattacks against Estonia were carried out by non-state actors, meaning Articles 2(4) and 51 would not apply to them.\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nAnother aspect of this cyberattack is the implication of NATO Article 5,⁹⁵ which would evoke a collective defensive response against Russia from NATO members.⁹⁶ Some experts speculate that the Russian government purposefully fell short of the threshold for invoking Article 5 due to the severe repercussions it may face from NATO's collective defense.⁹⁷ While Article 5 was not invoked in the Estonia cyberattacks, it is clear that NATO will defend its allies against a cyberattack.⁹⁸ Article 5 serves as another layer of defense for NATO countries against serious cyberattacks, a resource that should be used more often.\n## B. Cyberattacks Between Russia and Ukraine While there is a physical war between Russian and Ukraine,⁹⁹ the battle is also occurring in cyberspace. Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine began as early as 2014.¹⁰⁰ Three days before the referendum vote on the status of Crimea, Russia launched an eight-minute DDoS cyberattack against Ukraine to\"destabilize communications and spread confusion whilst troops overran the region.\"¹⁰¹ Also in 2014, a pro-Russian hacking group carried out cyberattacks to manipulate voting in the Ukrainian presidential election.¹⁰² The hackers targeted the Central Election Commission in an attempt to change election results.¹⁰³ More notably, in 2015 Russia carried out another DDoS attack that affected energy Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] distribution companies and left over 230,000 Ukrainian citizens without power for one-to-six hours.¹⁰⁴ The infamous Russian hacking group, Sandworm, is attributed to this cyberattack.¹⁰⁵ The destructive attack is believed to be the first example of a power outage caused by a cyberattack.¹⁰⁶ The malware used in this attack is called “BlackEnergy,” a malware also known to have compromised NATO, many Western European countries, and energy companies.¹⁰⁷ Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, cyberattacks from Russia soared in early 2022.¹⁰⁸ On January 14, 2022, Russian hackers brought down seventy Ukrainian government websites, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education.¹⁰⁹ Before the sites went down, a message appeared in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish that read “Prepare for the worst” and warned Ukrainian citizens, “All your personal data has been sent to a public network. All data on your computer is destroyed and cannot be recovered.”¹¹⁰ Right before the invasion on February 14, 2022, a DDoS attack targeted websites of Ukraine’s armed forces, public radio, and two of the biggest national banks.¹¹¹ The cyberattack brought down the banks for two hours and rendered the mobile apps and online payments inoperable.¹¹² Following Russia’s invasion, a number of cyberattacks ensued, including the KA-SAT satellite network¹¹³ and more cyberattacks on Ukraine’s digital infrastructure blocking access to financial services and energy.¹¹⁴ Another notable interruption includes a cyberattack on a Ukrainian radio station\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nWhile Ukraine has been successful at fighting off the bombardment of cyberattacks since the Russian invasion, experts are speculating that Russia may be holding back¹¹⁶ and is set to escalate its cyberattacks against Ukraine.¹¹⁷ In its February 2023 Threat Analysis Group, Google assessed Russia will “increase disruptive and destructive attacks in response to developments on the battlefield that fundamentally shift the balance... toward Ukraine.”¹¹⁸ Cyber threat group, Recorded Future, also noted in its February 2023 report that “in the near term, Russia will very likely launch a renewed offensive in Ukraine.”¹¹⁹ If the prediction of increased cyberattacks is true, invoking Articles 2(4) and 51 should be considered. Applying Article 51’s use of self-defense might not be problematic in this instance because the cyberattacks against Ukraine have already been attributed to Russia, and it is clear any further cyberattacks will also be attributed to the Russian government. The familiar problem would be applying Article 2(4). The definition of “armed force” is extremely limited and traditionally includes only physical force and effects. However, considering more modern interpretations of “armed force,” an argument could be made that the consequences of Russia’s cyberattack are not minimal. If Russia plans to ramp up its cyberwarfare, Russia may be successful at shutting down Ukraine’s electric grid as it has tried in the past. As mentioned before, the ambiguity of what constitutes “armed force” makes it difficult to apply this law. However, an attack of this magnitude may be enough to trigger Article 2(4), regardless of any physical destruction.\n¹¹⁵. Brumfield, supra note 109.\n¹¹⁶.

China In its 2023 Annual Threat Assessment, U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) opined that “China remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to the U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks.”¹²⁰ For decades, the People’s Republic of China has engaged in malicious cyberattacks against U.S. institutions, “including healthcare, financial services, defense industrial base, energy, government facilities, chemical, critical manufacturing (including automotive and aerospace), communications, IT (including managed service providers), international trade, education, video gaming, faith-based organizations, and law firms.”¹²¹ According to data from CrowdStrike, China was responsible for sixty-seven percent of state-sponsored cyberattacks “motivated both by intellectual property (IP) theft and intelligence gathering objectives” in 2021.¹²² Compared with just seven percent for the Iranian government and one percent for the Russian government, China’s stunning cyber involvement presents the biggest threat to U.S. business and government.¹²³ China’s malicious cyberattacks came to the forefront with Operation Aurora in January 2010.¹²⁴ Operation Aurora was a series of attacks from China that compromised many U.S. companies such as Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical, and Google.¹²⁵ Google was the only company to publicly come forward and announce that the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists had been compromised.¹²⁶ As a result of this attack and --- ¹²⁰. *People’s Republic of China Cyber Threat*, CYBERSECURITY &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE SEC.

An Iranian intelligence agency hacker broke into a Dutch Security Company, called DigiNotar, and issued fraudulent encryption certificates, which allowed the Iran to spy on all Iranian Gmail users.¹³⁸ The hacker breached the company by adding a rule in a router that forced Google's traffic through another route inside the country.¹³⁹ While most victims of Iran's cyberattacks are Iranian or surrounding countries, Iran has carried out major cyberattacks on U.S. banks.¹⁴⁰ In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment of\"seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam (ITSEC) and Mersad Company (MERSAD), that performed work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on computer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\"¹⁴¹ The DDoS attacks allowed the hackers access to forty-six financial institutions, including\"Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&amp;T and HSBC.\"¹⁴² Some days, the cyberattacks overwhelmed computer servers with as\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## IV.

Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin added thousands of satellites to the Earth's low orbit.¹⁵⁴ For example, SpaceX plans to send over 40,000 Starlink satellites into space to provide low-cost Internet to remote areas worldwide.¹⁵⁵ With more plans to launch satellites from SpaceX and other companies, comes more demand for building satellites cheaper and faster.¹⁵⁶ The rapid building of satellites is of increasing interest¹⁵⁷ due to the possibility of companies cutting corners to decrease costs and speed up production.¹⁵⁸ The commercial space industry boom has opened the door for more cyberattacks. There are more non-government space actors than ever, and the highly technical aspect of building satellites allows multiple manufacturers to be involved in a single satellite.¹⁵⁹ These new realities create new targets along an extensive supply chain that companies and governments are not currently equipped to handle.\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nOne example of the consequences a cyberattack may have on a satellite comes via the Viasat KA-SAT case. On February 24, 2022, the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a cyberattack was launched against Viasat's KA-SAT satellite broadband service.¹⁶⁰ The cyberattack impacted the internet access of tens of thousands of Ukrainian and EU citizens and severed the remote monitoring access of 5,800 wind turbines of a German energy company.¹⁶¹ The malware used to carry out the attacks is called\"AcidRain,\"designed to remotely\"wipe modems and routers.\"¹⁶² The AcidRain malware bears coding similarities with another malware previously attributed to Russia's Sandworm group.¹⁶³ This piece of evidence, along with the suspicious timing of the cyberattack, leads many to conclude Russia sponsored the cyberattack.¹⁶⁴ The U.S. formally attributed the satellite cyberattack to Russia in a press statement by the Secretary of State.¹⁶⁵ While the U.S., E.U., and other countries condemned the cyberattacks, there was no discussion of its applicability to Articles 2(4) and 51, nor NATO Article 5 repercussions.¹⁶⁶ Such inaction to punish Russia continues to set a dangerous precedent of allowing state-sponsored malicious cyberattacks.\n¹⁶⁰.

W32.Gammima.AG Virus on the International Space Station In 2008, Windows XP laptops on the International Space Station (ISS) were infected with a virus called W32.Gammima.AG.¹⁶⁷ The virus was linked to Russian astronauts who carried infected USB devices on the ISS and spread the computer virus to infected computers.¹⁶⁸ Although the virus is considered a low-level threat, the ability of a computer to become affected in the ISS exposed the flaws of the computers at the stations and their vulnerabilities to attacks.¹⁶⁹ Following the vulnerability, the United Space Allowance changed the computer systems on the ISS from Windows XP to Linux for more security.¹⁷⁰ ## B. Differences Between the Landscape of Space Law and Cyber Law One lesson cyberspace can learn from space comes from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.¹⁷¹ This treaty, negotiated at the height of the Cold War, codified important space principles still used today. The Outer Space Treaty declares that the exploration and use of outer space “shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries”¹⁷² and that outer space is free for exploration by all states.¹⁷³ However, it also limits some state activity, such as claims over outer space and celestial bodies,¹⁷⁴ and expressly prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in outer space.¹⁷⁵ While the Outer Space Treaty has not escaped\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## V. INTERNATIONAL CYBER TREATY\nThough it may be difficult to envision a Cyber Treaty that addresses the issues outlined in this Comment, European countries agreed to a comprehensive international cybercrime treaty in 2001.¹⁸⁰ The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”), among many other things, defines criminal offenses for cybercrime and establishes domestic procedures for prosecuting computer crimes.¹⁸¹ Moreover, the UN is working on another major Cybercrime Convention to deal with topics like international cooperation on cybercrime, law\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] enforcement's access to digital evidence, and strengthening procedural safeguards and human rights provisions.¹⁸² There has been an international treaty on cybercrime for over twenty years, and another one is forthcoming. Why is there no international treaty on cross-border cyberattacks sponsored by state actors? The answer is embedded in politics and conflicting state interests.\n## A. Defining Cyberattack The first step to drafting a successful International Cyber Treaty will be defining a cyberattack. Without a cohesive, agreed-upon definition of cyberattack, it is challenging to differentiate cyberattacks from cybercrime and cyberespionage.¹⁸³ The definition of cyberattack should be specific and concise, leaving no room for interpretation. Making the definition of a cyberattack too broad may open the door for differing interpretations and further disagreements.¹⁸⁴ While the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyberattack is a good starting point, its effect-based approach is problematic for several reasons.¹⁸⁵ First, the definition focuses on the cyberattack causing injury, death, or destruction to objects. Most cyberattacks do not cause such effects but rather result in, among other things, data loss and server disruption.¹⁸⁶ For example, the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused financial losses and general inconvenience to the public, but there was no injury, death, or destruction to objects.¹⁸⁷ Another issue with the Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattack is that it does not address the intent to cause injury, death, or destruction to objects. For instance, consider a Russian-sponsored cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, hoping to destroy it. If, for some reason, the cyberattack is not accomplished, it would not be deemed a\"cyberattack\"under the Tallinn Manual. A state actor should be held accountable for failed or uncompleted cyberattacks because the state intended to cause\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## B. Clear Attribution and Defense Guidelines\nAttribution is deemed to be the most challenging aspect of cyberattacks.¹⁸⁸ The Cyber Treaty must establish elements needed to attribute a cyberattack to the wrongdoing state. Along with the elements of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should outline the evidence a state must present to prove attribution. Evidence may include IP addresses, information from political sources, similarities to malware with known actors, the temporal proximity of similar cyberattacks, and using a “honeypot” to identify actors.¹⁸⁹ With these guidelines in place, states should no longer be able to shift responsibility to groups or individuals hired to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹⁰\nMoreover, attribution is crucial for a state’s legitimate claim of self-defense.¹⁹¹ Accordingly, the Cyber Treaty should outline how a state may defend itself in a cyberattack. It is important to clarify what kind of attack a state may retaliate with, whether purely cyber or a mixed attack. These guidelines should still be in accordance with the international principles of necessity and proportionality discussed previously.\n## C. Inclusion of Non-State Actors\nAlong the same lines of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should encompass the actions of non-state actors as cyberattacks. The laws of war do not apply to non-state actors, which is problematic when states employ groups or individuals to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹² It is hypothesized that non-state actors could violate the laws of war if a “clear relationship” exists with a state.\n---\n¹⁸⁸. See Simmons, supra note 13, at 100.\n¹⁸⁹. See Nguyen, supra note 93, at 1105.\n¹⁹⁰. See discussion supra Section III.A.\n¹⁹¹. See Moore, supra note 21, at 242.\n¹⁹². See discussion supra Section II.B.3.\nStetson Business Law Review\n[Vol. 4.1]\n\nInstead, the Cyber Treaty should focus on state responsibility for the actions of non-state actors. First and foremost, a cyberattack must be considered state conduct if a state sponsors a cyberattack. More importantly, states should be held responsible for the acts of non-actors, especially when states knowingly allow\"its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"¹⁹⁵ Such a rule would hold states like Russia responsible for the acts of Russian hackers that carry out thousands of cyberattacks.¹⁹⁶ This framework would also remove the ability of states to claim plausible deniability for the actions of others because any cyberattack carried out within a state's territory would be the state's responsibility. Going further, even if there is no state involvement, the state should still be held responsible for not taking the appropriate measures to stop the attacks.\n## D. Possibility of an International Cyber Treaty While the idea of a Cyber Treaty is conceptually solid, many forces make its adoption uncertain in the real world. International politics and conflicting state interests play a vital role in the making and passing of international law.¹⁹⁷ A viable Cyber Treaty will require states with different views on cyberattacks to come together and agree on its terms.¹⁹⁸ Although not all UN member\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## 1. Conflicting State Interests\nThe key players in the Cyber Treaty are Russia, China, and the U.S. Each state has different cyber goals. For example, Russia focuses on cyber policies that support state sovereignty and the ability to keep citizen loyalties in check.¹⁹⁹ China has similar goals as Russia and emphasizes the importance of preemptive cyberattacks.²⁰⁰ Meanwhile, the U.S. is focused on cooperation between international law enforcement agencies to stop cyberattacks and apprehend cybercriminals.²⁰¹ Despite multiple efforts by the Russian government²⁰² to reach an agreement on cyber matters with the U.S., the U.S. remains apprehensive about Russia's intentions, and with good reason.²⁰³ Although the U.S. and Russia have not agreed on most cyber issues, in 2015, Russia and China entered into a bilateral cyber treaty that pledges neither state will launch a cyberattack against the other.²⁰⁴ While this treaty only binds Russia and China, it marks a first step toward an International Cyber Treaty. I do not believe the conflicting state interests between China, Russia, and the United States will render a Cyber Treaty impossible. States should set\n¹⁹⁹. See Timothy L.

Moving Past the Politics\nRussia and the U.S. had even more significant ideological differences during the Cold War.²⁰⁶ Though cyberattacks cause catastrophic effects on the economy, infrastructure, supply chains, and more,²⁰⁷ the severity of the Cold War cannot be compared. The Cold War was not just a space race but also a nuclear arms race between the U.S. and Russia.²⁰⁸ These two nations were actively developing weapons of mass destruction and threatening each other with nuclear attacks.²⁰⁹ However, during the height of the Cold War, important agreements were reached, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere) and the Outer Space Treaty (outlawing weapons of mass destruction in outer space).²¹⁰ If the U.S. and Russia reached agreements during such tense and terrifying times, it should be possible to do the same in today's world. An International Cyber Treaty that provides rules and guidance on cyberattacks would benefit both countries and promote stability in the \"fifth battlespace.\"²¹¹\n## E.

The U.N. has\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nWhile these groups are important in developing norms and guidelines for cyber matters, the drawback of the groups is in their non-binding nature. Though some nations, namely Russia, that are part of these groups work with other experts to develop these guidelines, it is clear the rules are not being followed by the member-states. While the reports serve as important guiding principles all states should follow, the reality is they are not being properly adhered to. This is another reason why a Cyber Treaty is needed. There is only so much that non-binding norms and U.N. resolutions will do in getting states to cooperate with proper cyber behavior.\n\nThe above-mentioned group of experts (“Experts”) on this matter consists of twenty-five members from different U.N. member countries. Some of the countries participating in this group include the United States, Estonia, China, and notably, Russia.\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] In its latest July 2021 Report, the Experts built on their recommendations of the 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports which laid out eleven non-binding norms of state behavior in the context of international security.²¹⁸ Some of the norms outlined include states not knowingly allowing their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs, states taking appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from ICT threats, and states should not knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams.²¹⁹ These norms are further analyzed in the expert’s 2021 report on this matter, including examples of “the kinds of institutional arrangements that States can put in place at the national and regional levels to support their implementation.”²²⁰ For example, regarding the norm that states should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for wrongful acts using ICTs, the experts propose that “[a] State that is aware of but lacks the capacity to address internationally wrongful acts conducted using ICTs in its territory may consider seeking assistance from other States or the private sector in a manner consistent with international and domestic law.”²²¹ This norm is especially important in aiding developing countries that may not have adequate capacity to deal with these complex matters.\n\nAnother group that is currently working on cyber and information security matters is the above-stated open-ended working group (“Group”).²²² This Group convened for its fifth substantive session from July 24-28, 2023. At its eightieth session, the group will submit a final report to the General Assembly.²²³ In its first annual 2022 progress report, the Group noted that cyber cooperation and assistance between states “could be strengthened to ensure the integrity of the supply chain and\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## VI. CONCLUSION\nThis Comment focused on the application of the laws of war to cyberattacks. While there is no question the laws of war codified in the UN Charter apply to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient in practice. Issues arise due to the nature of cyberattacks and the traditional definitions of \"force\" and \"armed attack.\" Moreover, there is difficulty in applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks due to proper state attribution and the exclusion of non-state actors. These challenges can be addressed by a Cyber Treaty negotiated by the three key players: the U.S., China, and Russia. Although the cyber interests and goals of the U.S. are different from those of Russia and China, the differences should not render a Cyber Treaty impossible. Much like during the Cold War with the passing of the Outer Space Treaty, the first step is to put politics behind and realize creating a Cyber Treaty could benefit all.\n²²⁴. Id.\n²²⁵.

INTRODUCTION Approximately ninety-two cyberattacks will occur during the time it takes to read this article. A University of Maryland study found that, on average, there is one cyberattack every thirty-nine seconds around the world.² This haunting statistic puts into perspective the magnitude of international cybercrime. It explains why 156 nations, including the United States, Russia, China, and Iran, have taken measures to combat the ever-increasing problem of cybercrime.³ What happens, however, when nations perpetuate cybercrime against other nations? These so-called cross-border, aggressive, state-sponsored cyberattacks are an increasing international problem. Since 2005, there have been at least 247 cyberattacks sponsored by China, 174 by Russia, 97 by Iran, and\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nThis comment examines the applicability of current international laws of war to cross-border attacks sponsored by state actors. It is apparent that the laws of the United Nations' (\"UN\") Charter are insufficient to address cyberattacks. The international arena must devote its efforts to working on an International Cyber Treaty (\"Cyber Treaty\") that addresses state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Cyber Treaty should clarify conflicting standards and fill gaps in current international law. This comment examines the feasibility of the Cyber Treaty considering the key players' conflicting interests.\nPart II addresses the *jus ad bellum* principles of international law: UN Charter Articles 2(4) and 51 and their applicability to cyber-attacks. Part III examines the Russian-sponsored 2007 Estonia Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\") Attack and its applicability to the laws of war. Part IV highlights the intersection between cybersecurity and outer space, including the increasing concern for satellite cyberattacks. Moreover, this Part discusses the differences and similarities between the legal instruments of space law and cyber law. Part V proposes an International Cyber Treaty that fills in the gaps left by applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## II. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ATTACKS ### A. Applicable International Law The UN is the most influential international organization that creates and codifies international law.⁶ The UN Charter contains Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] many significant laws, including Article 2(4),7 arguably one of the most important rules of modern international law.8 Articles 2(4) and (51)9 of the UN Charter codify the international law concept of *jus ad bellum*, which is the international law governing states going to war (“laws of war”). The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations10 (“Tallinn Manual” or “Manual”) defines *jus ad bellum* as “international law governing a State’s resort to force as an instrument of its national policy.”11 Plainly stated, this principle lays out the circumstances under which states could permissibly go to war. The core of *jus ad bellum* lies in the general prohibition against states using force on one another, found in Article 2(4), coupled with two exceptions in Articles 39 and 51. Working together with *jus ad bellum* is the international law principle of *jus in bello*, which governs a state’s conduct once already engaged in war.12 Applying *jus in bello* to cyberattacks is also a complex discussion topic that has earned scholars’ attention. This comment, however, focuses on applying *jus ad bellum* only to cyberattacks.\n## 1. Threat or Use of Force Article 2(4) of the UN Charter declares that: All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or in developing nations). But see Julia Zorthian, *5 United Nations Achievements Worth Celebrating on U.N. Day*, TIME (Oct. 23, 2015, 6:20PM), https://time.com/4085757/united-nations-achievements/. (listing major UN accomplishments including pyramid preservation, smallpox eradication, and arms control promotion).\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nThe age-old question is: What did the UN mean by\"force\"?14 The answer is, of course, it depends. Before diving into the different interpretations of the word\"force,\"it is helpful to understand the historical events that led to the adoption of Article 2(4). The core of Article 2(4) traces back to the end of World War I when the League of Nations declared that\"any war or threat of war\"was of concern to the world.15 The development of Article 2(4) continued with the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which condemned states resorting to war and ended in 1945 with the formal signing of the UN Charter, formally establishing the UN and articulating Article 2(4).16 The events leading up to the formal recitation of Article 2(4) include the two World Wars, which along with the UN's aim\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\"17 suggests a focus on the use of force by way of military instruments.18 This determination also paves the way for the dominant view that Article 2(4) prohibits physical armed force only, as opposed to, for example, force as coercion.19 It is generally accepted and historically understood that force under Article 2(4) requires\"armed force.\"20 In support of this view, the UN Charter's preamble states that\"armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.\"21 In addition, Article 51 Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] (discussed below) references self-defense against armed attacks.²² The problem with this strict interpretation is that only instances of military violence would violate Article 2(4), and states may only exercise the right of self-defense under Article 51 from armed military violence of another state.²³ ## 2. Exceptions to Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the use of force is subject to two exceptions: force may be allowed if the UN Security Council determines such force is needed to restore the peace²⁴ and if a state is acting in self-defense.²⁵ Article 51 codifies the latter exception providing that: [n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.²⁶ The UN left the term\"armed attack\"undefined, which leads to competing interpretations of the term's intended meaning.²⁷ What is clear from Article 51 is that the right of self-defense is based on principles of necessity and proportionality.²⁸ A state's use of force under Article 2(4) might be legitimate under Article 51 only if there was an armed attack before the claim of self-defense, meaning Article 51 does not protect preemptive state attacks.²⁹ ## B. Applicability and Sufficiency of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks Before applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks, it is necessary first to define a cyberattack. Starting with what a cyberattack is not, a cyberattack is not the same thing as\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nRegarding the application of Articles 2(4) and 51, there is increasing agreement among states and scholars that these rules apply to cyberattacks.³⁷ States in agreement include the United States, the United Kingdom, and Estonia.³⁸ The Tallinn Manual Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] also supports this conclusion: “[b]oth International Groups of Experts were unanimous in their estimation that existing international law applies to cyber operations.”³⁹ Difficulties arise when applying the laws of war to cyberattacks due to the traditional language of the Articles.⁴⁰ It is through no fault of their own, however, that the UN’s founders did not foresee the current modern digital world and the possibility of cyberattacks before the signing of the UN Charter in 1945. In fact, the International Court of Justice declared that Articles 2(4) and 51 “appl[y] to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed” in their analysis of whether the use of nuclear weapons constituted force.⁴¹ As such, the inquiry is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies to cyberattacks but *how* to successfully apply these traditional law principles to this non-traditional weapon. The difficulty of applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks lies in the attacks’ nature.⁴² Cyberattacks are virtual, complex, anonymous, and can cause catastrophic injury to millions, potentially billions, of people, with some simple lines of code.⁴³ The unique features of cyberattacks pose difficulties when applying the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack,” leading to the conclusion that the current laws of war may be insufficient to confront this problem.⁴⁴ Concerning force under Article 2(4), the primary consideration is whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force required under the traditional definition. There are six helpful factors to determine whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force.⁴⁵ These factors are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and-international-law-in-the-21st-century); Kersti Kaljulaid, Former President of the Republic of Estonia, Remarks at the Opening of CyCon 2019 (May 29, 2019) (stating “[w]e believe and state that both the rights and obligations of international law, including those stated in the U.N. Charter, do apply to states when using IT and communication technologies”).\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## 2. Exceptions to the Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Revisited\nLikewise, Article 51 also begs the question of whether a cyberattack rises to the level of an armed attack required for a state to enjoy the right of self-defense. Article 51 is seemingly narrower than Article 2(4), meaning that not all uses of force qualify as armed attacks.⁵⁰ There are three factors to consider whether a cyberattack constitutes an “armed attack.”⁵¹ These factors include the consequences of the attack, the state’s consideration of aggressive intent, and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack.⁵² Consistent with the meaning of armed force under Article 2(4), the consequences of an armed attack must rise to a certain level in severity for a state to be justified in using self-defense.⁵³ Using these factors, a severe DDoS attack against the United States that cripples infrastructure would be considered armed force due to the severity.⁵⁴ In this scenario, the United States can respond with an armed force to defend itself, granted it abides by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and the attack can be attributed to a state actor.⁵⁵ A state’s right to use\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] armed force after a cyberattack raises the question of what type of force it may use to defend itself, which this Comment addresses in the proceeding Section.\n## 3. Application of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks is Insufficient While it is possible to apply *jus ad bellum* to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient to regulate cyberattacks due to the traditional interpretation of the laws. One of the most significant difficulties in applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks is that the traditional definition of “armed force” focuses on force carried out physically and having a physical effect, such as a conventional bomb.⁵⁶ This interpretation would be too narrow for cyberattacks, considering the non-physical nature of cyberattacks. Although a cyberattack may trigger a physical reaction, much of the concern regarding cyberattacks surrounds a state’s loss or destruction of data.⁵⁷ Second, even using the more expansive definitions of *force* that focus on the attack’s consequences presented by Schmitt and the Tallinn Manual, the threshold for these factors is unclear. For example, the Estonia DDoS attack⁵⁸ merely caused confusion and unrest, even though the attack was on Estonia’s infrastructure.⁵⁹ Under Schmitt’s and the Manual’s framework, would the Estonia cyberattack rise to the level of armed force, even though its consequences were minimal and trivial?⁶⁰ The answer is unclear, considering the ambiguous definitions and traditional understanding of “armed force.” Even using broad interpretations of “force,” many ambiguities surround applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks.\nApplying Article 51 to cyberattacks is also problematic due to the issue of attribution. Attribution is a crucial step to claims of self-defense under Article 51.⁶¹ A state must know the perpetrator’s identity to retaliate under Article 51.⁶² Cyberattacks are distinguishable from conventional attacks because there are no soldiers, physical presence, or weapons to determine the\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nAlong these lines of retaliation, the type of force a state may use in retaliation is also ambiguous. Using the example of the severe DDoS attack against the U.S., the question is: Provided the U.S. knows which state perpetuated the attack, could the U.S. launch its own attack against the state and cripple that state's infrastructure? The U.S. would be bound to retaliate using another\"pure cyberattack\"(meaning no physical effect), considering the principles of necessity and proportionality.⁶⁷ However, what if, for some reason, a\"pure cyberattack\"was not a viable option for the U.S.? Could the U.S. respond with physical force, or must it forego its right of self-defense? Once again, the current laws of war do not answer this question.\nAnother problematic element of the laws of war is that non-state actors cannot violate Article 2(4) because it applies only to state actors.⁶⁸ It is common practice for governments to contract individuals or groups of hackers to attack states.⁶⁹ If a non-state actor carries out a cyberattack, the attacked state cannot enjoy the right of self-defense under Article 51. In addition, under the current principles of jus ad bellum, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda may launch cyberattacks against states with (in theory) no retaliation since al-Qaeda is not a state actor. Once again, this Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] appears to be the wrong conclusion, especially considering the large number of non-state actors that launch cyberattacks.\n## III. CROSS-BORDER AGGRESSIVE CYBERATTACKS BETWEEN STATE ACTORS ### A. Estonia DDoS Attack In 2007, Estonia became the first victim of a cyberattack sponsored by a state actor.70 The cyberattacks were in response to the Estonian government's choice to relocate a Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn.71 The type of attack utilized was the Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\"), one of the most commonly used cyberattacks.72 DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a site with fake requests to the point that the site cannot respond to all requests, and subsequently, the site crashes.73 The DDoS attacks targeted the Estonian\"government and parliamentary portals, ministries, news outlets, internet service providers, major banks, and small businesses.\"74 These attacks profoundly affected Estonia's infrastructure due to the state's heavy reliance on the Internet.75 This tiny nation, dubbed e-Estonia, is at the forefront of e-democracy76 and is recognized as the world's most advanced digital society.77 The sites of the two biggest Estonian banks were offline for about forty-five to ninety minutes, blocking access to simple financial tasks such as accessing or transferring money.78 Also, the\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nRegarding responsibility, no concrete evidence exists attributing the cyberattack to a state. However, there is information available to suggest that Russia could have been at least indirectly responsible for the attacks.⁸⁰ Evidence of Russian responsibility included IP addresses tracing back to the computers of Russian government agencies, the Russian government's refusal to assist the Estonian government in resolving the attacks,⁸¹ and DDoS online attack instructions written in Russian.⁸² Furthermore, Russia severed commercially important railways with no prior notice for alleged repairs during the attacks.⁸³ While the Russian government completely denies responsibility,⁸⁴ the overwhelming evidence points to some Russian government orchestration, especially considering the funding needed for such attacks.⁸⁵ However, since no\"smoking gun\"proves Russian government involvement, it is difficult to attribute the attack to Russia properly. There was, however, one conviction in connection with the cyberattacks. Dmitri Galuškevits, an Estonian student of Russian origin, was convicted for targeting a political party's website.⁸⁶ The size of the operation suggests many others were responsible for the attacks, however, due to Russia's non-cooperation, the rest remain without any repercussions.⁸⁷ Applying the laws of war to the Estonian cyberattacks yields contradicting results, showing exactly why another solution is Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] needed. Michael Schmitt applies his “use of force” framework and concludes that the Estonian cyberattacks rose to the level of “armed force.”88 Schmitt cites the severe consequences of the attack, such as the disruption of government function and services, economic turmoil, and adverse effects on the Estonian people.89 Likewise, Schmitt reasons the attacks were immediate, direct, invasive, and presumably illegitimate.90 Schmitt concedes there is difficulty quantifying the consequences of the cyberattack as the only factor opposing the conclusion. Balancing all the elements, Schmitt concludes, “the incident arguably reached the use-of-force threshold.”91 Interestingly, Reese Nguyen comes to the opposite conclusion using this same framework on the Estonian cyberattacks.92 Nguyen claims (1) the cyberattacks were not that severe due to lack of injury and destruction; (2) the consequences were delayed; (3) the effects were not directly tied to the DDoS attacks; (4) there was minimal invasion due to the remote execution of the cyberattacks; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify; and (6) since the attacks were legitimate because they were limited to telecommunication systems.93 Using the same (widely accepted94) framework to determine whether a cyberattack amounts to the “use of force” and reaching contradictory conclusions exposes the inadequacy of applying jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the contradictory framework of Article 2(4), applying Article 51 to the Estonian cyberattacks would also be problematic. Since the cyberattacks were not adequately attributed to Russia, Estonia could not use the right of self-defense outlined in Article 51. Even more problematic is that the cyberattacks against Estonia were carried out by non-state actors, meaning Articles 2(4) and 51 would not apply to them.\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nAnother aspect of this cyberattack is the implication of NATO Article 5,⁹⁵ which would evoke a collective defensive response against Russia from NATO members.⁹⁶ Some experts speculate that the Russian government purposefully fell short of the threshold for invoking Article 5 due to the severe repercussions it may face from NATO's collective defense.⁹⁷ While Article 5 was not invoked in the Estonia cyberattacks, it is clear that NATO will defend its allies against a cyberattack.⁹⁸ Article 5 serves as another layer of defense for NATO countries against serious cyberattacks, a resource that should be used more often.\n## B. Cyberattacks Between Russia and Ukraine While there is a physical war between Russian and Ukraine,⁹⁹ the battle is also occurring in cyberspace. Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine began as early as 2014.¹⁰⁰ Three days before the referendum vote on the status of Crimea, Russia launched an eight-minute DDoS cyberattack against Ukraine to\"destabilize communications and spread confusion whilst troops overran the region.\"¹⁰¹ Also in 2014, a pro-Russian hacking group carried out cyberattacks to manipulate voting in the Ukrainian presidential election.¹⁰² The hackers targeted the Central Election Commission in an attempt to change election results.¹⁰³ More notably, in 2015 Russia carried out another DDoS attack that affected energy Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] distribution companies and left over 230,000 Ukrainian citizens without power for one-to-six hours.¹⁰⁴ The infamous Russian hacking group, Sandworm, is attributed to this cyberattack.¹⁰⁵ The destructive attack is believed to be the first example of a power outage caused by a cyberattack.¹⁰⁶ The malware used in this attack is called “BlackEnergy,” a malware also known to have compromised NATO, many Western European countries, and energy companies.¹⁰⁷ Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, cyberattacks from Russia soared in early 2022.¹⁰⁸ On January 14, 2022, Russian hackers brought down seventy Ukrainian government websites, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education.¹⁰⁹ Before the sites went down, a message appeared in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish that read “Prepare for the worst” and warned Ukrainian citizens, “All your personal data has been sent to a public network. All data on your computer is destroyed and cannot be recovered.”¹¹⁰ Right before the invasion on February 14, 2022, a DDoS attack targeted websites of Ukraine’s armed forces, public radio, and two of the biggest national banks.¹¹¹ The cyberattack brought down the banks for two hours and rendered the mobile apps and online payments inoperable.¹¹² Following Russia’s invasion, a number of cyberattacks ensued, including the KA-SAT satellite network¹¹³ and more cyberattacks on Ukraine’s digital infrastructure blocking access to financial services and energy.¹¹⁴ Another notable interruption includes a cyberattack on a Ukrainian radio station\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nWhile Ukraine has been successful at fighting off the bombardment of cyberattacks since the Russian invasion, experts are speculating that Russia may be holding back¹¹⁶ and is set to escalate its cyberattacks against Ukraine.¹¹⁷ In its February 2023 Threat Analysis Group, Google assessed Russia will “increase disruptive and destructive attacks in response to developments on the battlefield that fundamentally shift the balance... toward Ukraine.”¹¹⁸ Cyber threat group, Recorded Future, also noted in its February 2023 report that “in the near term, Russia will very likely launch a renewed offensive in Ukraine.”¹¹⁹ If the prediction of increased cyberattacks is true, invoking Articles 2(4) and 51 should be considered. Applying Article 51’s use of self-defense might not be problematic in this instance because the cyberattacks against Ukraine have already been attributed to Russia, and it is clear any further cyberattacks will also be attributed to the Russian government. The familiar problem would be applying Article 2(4). The definition of “armed force” is extremely limited and traditionally includes only physical force and effects. However, considering more modern interpretations of “armed force,” an argument could be made that the consequences of Russia’s cyberattack are not minimal. If Russia plans to ramp up its cyberwarfare, Russia may be successful at shutting down Ukraine’s electric grid as it has tried in the past. As mentioned before, the ambiguity of what constitutes “armed force” makes it difficult to apply this law. However, an attack of this magnitude may be enough to trigger Article 2(4), regardless of any physical destruction.\n¹¹⁵. Brumfield, supra note 109.\n¹¹⁶.

Threats from China and Iran ### 1. China In its 2023 Annual Threat Assessment, U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) opined that “China remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to the U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks.”¹²⁰ For decades, the People’s Republic of China has engaged in malicious cyberattacks against U.S. institutions, “including healthcare, financial services, defense industrial base, energy, government facilities, chemical, critical manufacturing (including automotive and aerospace), communications, IT (including managed service providers), international trade, education, video gaming, faith-based organizations, and law firms.”¹²¹ According to data from CrowdStrike, China was responsible for sixty-seven percent of state-sponsored cyberattacks “motivated both by intellectual property (IP) theft and intelligence gathering objectives” in 2021.¹²² Compared with just seven percent for the Iranian government and one percent for the Russian government, China’s stunning cyber involvement presents the biggest threat to U.S. business and government.¹²³ China’s malicious cyberattacks came to the forefront with Operation Aurora in January 2010.¹²⁴ Operation Aurora was a series of attacks from China that compromised many U.S. companies such as Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical, and Google.¹²⁵ Google was the only company to publicly come forward and announce that the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists had been compromised.¹²⁶ As a result of this attack and --- ¹²⁰. *People’s Republic of China Cyber Threat*, CYBERSECURITY &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE SEC.

Iran Also, in its 2023 Annual Threat Assessment, CISA stated, “Ahead of the U.S. election in 2024, Iran may attempt to conduct influence operations aimed at U.S. interests, including targeting U.S. elections, having demonstrated a willingness and capability to do so in the past.”¹³⁴ While Iran has not carried out massive cyberattacks against the United States in recent years, its cyber history is spectacular and damaging.\n--- ¹²⁷.

An Iranian intelligence agency hacker broke into a Dutch Security Company, called DigiNotar, and issued fraudulent encryption certificates, which allowed the Iran to spy on all Iranian Gmail users.¹³⁸ The hacker breached the company by adding a rule in a router that forced Google's traffic through another route inside the country.¹³⁹ While most victims of Iran's cyberattacks are Iranian or surrounding countries, Iran has carried out major cyberattacks on U.S. banks.¹⁴⁰ In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment of\"seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam (ITSEC) and Mersad Company (MERSAD), that performed work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on computer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\"¹⁴¹ The DDoS attacks allowed the hackers access to forty-six financial institutions, including\"Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&amp;T and HSBC.\"¹⁴² Some days, the cyberattacks overwhelmed computer servers with as\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## IV. SPACE LAW CONSIDERATIONS\n### A. Applicability of Cybersecurity in Outer Space\nWhile pairing cyberspace and outer space together may be unusual, the two are inextricably connected. Essential outer space services like the GPS require complex technology and software.¹⁴⁵ It is this very same reliance technology that exposes space objects to cyberattacks.¹⁴⁶\n#### 1. Satellites\nCyberattacks against outer space satellites are of increasing concern due to the consequences such an attack would have on everyday life.¹⁴⁷ Satellites are used for banking, power grids, farming, military defense, television programming, weather services, and more.¹⁴⁸ A successful cyberattack on a satellite could threaten a country's power grid or leave millions of people without communication services.¹⁴⁹ Some new satellites are equipped with \"thrusters\" and can be steered.¹⁵⁰ If such a satellite was hacked, its\n¹⁴³.

Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin added thousands of satellites to the Earth's low orbit.¹⁵⁴ For example, SpaceX plans to send over 40,000 Starlink satellites into space to provide low-cost Internet to remote areas worldwide.¹⁵⁵ With more plans to launch satellites from SpaceX and other companies, comes more demand for building satellites cheaper and faster.¹⁵⁶ The rapid building of satellites is of increasing interest¹⁵⁷ due to the possibility of companies cutting corners to decrease costs and speed up production.¹⁵⁸ The commercial space industry boom has opened the door for more cyberattacks. There are more non-government space actors than ever, and the highly technical aspect of building satellites allows multiple manufacturers to be involved in a single satellite.¹⁵⁹ These new realities create new targets along an extensive supply chain that companies and governments are not currently equipped to handle.\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nOne example of the consequences a cyberattack may have on a satellite comes via the Viasat KA-SAT case. On February 24, 2022, the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a cyberattack was launched against Viasat's KA-SAT satellite broadband service.¹⁶⁰ The cyberattack impacted the internet access of tens of thousands of Ukrainian and EU citizens and severed the remote monitoring access of 5,800 wind turbines of a German energy company.¹⁶¹ The malware used to carry out the attacks is called\"AcidRain,\"designed to remotely\"wipe modems and routers.\"¹⁶² The AcidRain malware bears coding similarities with another malware previously attributed to Russia's Sandworm group.¹⁶³ This piece of evidence, along with the suspicious timing of the cyberattack, leads many to conclude Russia sponsored the cyberattack.¹⁶⁴ The U.S. formally attributed the satellite cyberattack to Russia in a press statement by the Secretary of State.¹⁶⁵ While the U.S., E.U., and other countries condemned the cyberattacks, there was no discussion of its applicability to Articles 2(4) and 51, nor NATO Article 5 repercussions.¹⁶⁶ Such inaction to punish Russia continues to set a dangerous precedent of allowing state-sponsored malicious cyberattacks.\n¹⁶⁰.

W32.Gammima.AG Virus on the International Space Station In 2008, Windows XP laptops on the International Space Station (ISS) were infected with a virus called W32.Gammima.AG.¹⁶⁷ The virus was linked to Russian astronauts who carried infected USB devices on the ISS and spread the computer virus to infected computers.¹⁶⁸ Although the virus is considered a low-level threat, the ability of a computer to become affected in the ISS exposed the flaws of the computers at the stations and their vulnerabilities to attacks.¹⁶⁹ Following the vulnerability, the United Space Allowance changed the computer systems on the ISS from Windows XP to Linux for more security.¹⁷⁰ ## B. Differences Between the Landscape of Space Law and Cyber Law One lesson cyberspace can learn from space comes from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.¹⁷¹ This treaty, negotiated at the height of the Cold War, codified important space principles still used today. The Outer Space Treaty declares that the exploration and use of outer space “shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries”¹⁷² and that outer space is free for exploration by all states.¹⁷³ However, it also limits some state activity, such as claims over outer space and celestial bodies,¹⁷⁴ and expressly prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in outer space.¹⁷⁵ While the Outer Space Treaty has not escaped\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## V. INTERNATIONAL CYBER TREATY\nThough it may be difficult to envision a Cyber Treaty that addresses the issues outlined in this Comment, European countries agreed to a comprehensive international cybercrime treaty in 2001.¹⁸⁰ The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”), among many other things, defines criminal offenses for cybercrime and establishes domestic procedures for prosecuting computer crimes.¹⁸¹ Moreover, the UN is working on another major Cybercrime Convention to deal with topics like international cooperation on cybercrime, law\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] enforcement's access to digital evidence, and strengthening procedural safeguards and human rights provisions.¹⁸² There has been an international treaty on cybercrime for over twenty years, and another one is forthcoming. Why is there no international treaty on cross-border cyberattacks sponsored by state actors? The answer is embedded in politics and conflicting state interests.\n## A. Defining Cyberattack The first step to drafting a successful International Cyber Treaty will be defining a cyberattack. Without a cohesive, agreed-upon definition of cyberattack, it is challenging to differentiate cyberattacks from cybercrime and cyberespionage.¹⁸³ The definition of cyberattack should be specific and concise, leaving no room for interpretation. Making the definition of a cyberattack too broad may open the door for differing interpretations and further disagreements.¹⁸⁴ While the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyberattack is a good starting point, its effect-based approach is problematic for several reasons.¹⁸⁵ First, the definition focuses on the cyberattack causing injury, death, or destruction to objects. Most cyberattacks do not cause such effects but rather result in, among other things, data loss and server disruption.¹⁸⁶ For example, the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused financial losses and general inconvenience to the public, but there was no injury, death, or destruction to objects.¹⁸⁷ Another issue with the Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattack is that it does not address the intent to cause injury, death, or destruction to objects. For instance, consider a Russian-sponsored cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, hoping to destroy it. If, for some reason, the cyberattack is not accomplished, it would not be deemed a\"cyberattack\"under the Tallinn Manual. A state actor should be held accountable for failed or uncompleted cyberattacks because the state intended to cause\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## B. Clear Attribution and Defense Guidelines\nAttribution is deemed to be the most challenging aspect of cyberattacks.¹⁸⁸ The Cyber Treaty must establish elements needed to attribute a cyberattack to the wrongdoing state. Along with the elements of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should outline the evidence a state must present to prove attribution. Evidence may include IP addresses, information from political sources, similarities to malware with known actors, the temporal proximity of similar cyberattacks, and using a “honeypot” to identify actors.¹⁸⁹ With these guidelines in place, states should no longer be able to shift responsibility to groups or individuals hired to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹⁰\nMoreover, attribution is crucial for a state’s legitimate claim of self-defense.¹⁹¹ Accordingly, the Cyber Treaty should outline how a state may defend itself in a cyberattack. It is important to clarify what kind of attack a state may retaliate with, whether purely cyber or a mixed attack. These guidelines should still be in accordance with the international principles of necessity and proportionality discussed previously.\n## C. Inclusion of Non-State Actors\nAlong the same lines of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should encompass the actions of non-state actors as cyberattacks. The laws of war do not apply to non-state actors, which is problematic when states employ groups or individuals to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹² It is hypothesized that non-state actors could violate the laws of war if a “clear relationship” exists with a state.\n---\n¹⁸⁸. See Simmons, supra note 13, at 100.\n¹⁸⁹. See Nguyen, supra note 93, at 1105.\n¹⁹⁰. See discussion supra Section III.A.\n¹⁹¹. See Moore, supra note 21, at 242.\n¹⁹². See discussion supra Section II.B.3.\nStetson Business Law Review\n[Vol. 4.1]\n\nInstead, the Cyber Treaty should focus on state responsibility for the actions of non-state actors. First and foremost, a cyberattack must be considered state conduct if a state sponsors a cyberattack. More importantly, states should be held responsible for the acts of non-actors, especially when states knowingly allow\"its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"¹⁹⁵ Such a rule would hold states like Russia responsible for the acts of Russian hackers that carry out thousands of cyberattacks.¹⁹⁶ This framework would also remove the ability of states to claim plausible deniability for the actions of others because any cyberattack carried out within a state's territory would be the state's responsibility. Going further, even if there is no state involvement, the state should still be held responsible for not taking the appropriate measures to stop the attacks.\n## D. Possibility of an International Cyber Treaty While the idea of a Cyber Treaty is conceptually solid, many forces make its adoption uncertain in the real world. International politics and conflicting state interests play a vital role in the making and passing of international law.¹⁹⁷ A viable Cyber Treaty will require states with different views on cyberattacks to come together and agree on its terms.¹⁹⁸ Although not all UN member\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## 1. Conflicting State Interests\nThe key players in the Cyber Treaty are Russia, China, and the U.S. Each state has different cyber goals. For example, Russia focuses on cyber policies that support state sovereignty and the ability to keep citizen loyalties in check.¹⁹⁹ China has similar goals as Russia and emphasizes the importance of preemptive cyberattacks.²⁰⁰ Meanwhile, the U.S. is focused on cooperation between international law enforcement agencies to stop cyberattacks and apprehend cybercriminals.²⁰¹ Despite multiple efforts by the Russian government²⁰² to reach an agreement on cyber matters with the U.S., the U.S. remains apprehensive about Russia's intentions, and with good reason.²⁰³ Although the U.S. and Russia have not agreed on most cyber issues, in 2015, Russia and China entered into a bilateral cyber treaty that pledges neither state will launch a cyberattack against the other.²⁰⁴ While this treaty only binds Russia and China, it marks a first step toward an International Cyber Treaty. I do not believe the conflicting state interests between China, Russia, and the United States will render a Cyber Treaty impossible. States should set\n¹⁹⁹. See Timothy L.

Moving Past the Politics\nRussia and the U.S. had even more significant ideological differences during the Cold War.²⁰⁶ Though cyberattacks cause catastrophic effects on the economy, infrastructure, supply chains, and more,²⁰⁷ the severity of the Cold War cannot be compared. The Cold War was not just a space race but also a nuclear arms race between the U.S. and Russia.²⁰⁸ These two nations were actively developing weapons of mass destruction and threatening each other with nuclear attacks.²⁰⁹ However, during the height of the Cold War, important agreements were reached, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere) and the Outer Space Treaty (outlawing weapons of mass destruction in outer space).²¹⁰ If the U.S. and Russia reached agreements during such tense and terrifying times, it should be possible to do the same in today's world. An International Cyber Treaty that provides rules and guidance on cyberattacks would benefit both countries and promote stability in the \"fifth battlespace.\"²¹¹\n## E. UN Expert Groups\nIn its capacity, the U.N. has attempted to address the complex issues of cyberspace and international law. The U.N. has\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nWhile these groups are important in developing norms and guidelines for cyber matters, the drawback of the groups is in their non-binding nature. Though some nations, namely Russia, that are part of these groups work with other experts to develop these guidelines, it is clear the rules are not being followed by the member-states. While the reports serve as important guiding principles all states should follow, the reality is they are not being properly adhered to. This is another reason why a Cyber Treaty is needed. There is only so much that non-binding norms and U.N. resolutions will do in getting states to cooperate with proper cyber behavior.\n\nThe above-mentioned group of experts (“Experts”) on this matter consists of twenty-five members from different U.N. member countries. Some of the countries participating in this group include the United States, Estonia, China, and notably, Russia.\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] In its latest July 2021 Report, the Experts built on their recommendations of the 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports which laid out eleven non-binding norms of state behavior in the context of international security.²¹⁸ Some of the norms outlined include states not knowingly allowing their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs, states taking appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from ICT threats, and states should not knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams.²¹⁹ These norms are further analyzed in the expert’s 2021 report on this matter, including examples of “the kinds of institutional arrangements that States can put in place at the national and regional levels to support their implementation.”²²⁰ For example, regarding the norm that states should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for wrongful acts using ICTs, the experts propose that “[a] State that is aware of but lacks the capacity to address internationally wrongful acts conducted using ICTs in its territory may consider seeking assistance from other States or the private sector in a manner consistent with international and domestic law.”²²¹ This norm is especially important in aiding developing countries that may not have adequate capacity to deal with these complex matters.\n\nAnother group that is currently working on cyber and information security matters is the above-stated open-ended working group (“Group”).²²² This Group convened for its fifth substantive session from July 24-28, 2023. At its eightieth session, the group will submit a final report to the General Assembly.²²³ In its first annual 2022 progress report, the Group noted that cyber cooperation and assistance between states “could be strengthened to ensure the integrity of the supply chain and\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## VI. CONCLUSION\nThis Comment focused on the application of the laws of war to cyberattacks. While there is no question the laws of war codified in the UN Charter apply to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient in practice. Issues arise due to the nature of cyberattacks and the traditional definitions of \"force\" and \"armed attack.\" Moreover, there is difficulty in applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks due to proper state attribution and the exclusion of non-state actors. These challenges can be addressed by a Cyber Treaty negotiated by the three key players: the U.S., China, and Russia. Although the cyber interests and goals of the U.S. are different from those of Russia and China, the differences should not render a Cyber Treaty impossible. Much like during the Cold War with the passing of the Outer Space Treaty, the first step is to put politics behind and realize creating a Cyber Treaty could benefit all.\n²²⁴. Id.\n²²⁵.

The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations10 (“Tallinn Manual” or “Manual”) defines *jus ad bellum* as “international law governing a State’s resort to force as an instrument of its national policy.”11 Plainly stated, this principle lays out the circumstances under which states could permissibly go to war. The core of *jus ad bellum* lies in the general prohibition against states using force on one another, found in Article 2(4), coupled with two exceptions in Articles 39 and 51. Working together with *jus ad bellum* is the international law principle of *jus in bello*, which governs a state’s conduct once already engaged in war.12 Applying *jus in bello* to cyberattacks is also a complex discussion topic that has earned scholars’ attention. This comment, however, focuses on applying *jus ad bellum* only to cyberattacks. ## 1.

Before diving into the different interpretations of the word \"force,\" it is helpful to understand the historical events that led to the adoption of Article 2(4). The core of Article 2(4) traces back to the end of World War I when the League of Nations declared that \"any war or threat of war\" was of concern to the world.15 The development of Article 2(4) continued with the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which condemned states resorting to war and ended in 1945 with the formal signing of the UN Charter, formally establishing the UN and articulating Article 2(4).16 The events leading up to the formal recitation of Article 2(4) include the two World Wars, which along with the UN's aim \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\"17 suggests a focus on the use of force by way of military instruments.18 This determination also paves the way for the dominant view that Article 2(4) prohibits physical armed force only, as opposed to, for example, force as coercion.19 It is generally accepted and historically understood that force under Article 2(4) requires \"armed force.\"20 In support of this view, the UN Charter's preamble states that \"armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.\"21 In addition, Article 51",

Application of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks is Insufficient While it is possible to apply *jus ad bellum* to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient to regulate cyberattacks due to the traditional interpretation of the laws. One of the most significant difficulties in applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks is that the traditional definition of “armed force” focuses on force carried out physically and having a physical effect, such as a conventional bomb.⁵⁶ This interpretation would be too narrow for cyberattacks, considering the non-physical nature of cyberattacks. Although a cyberattack may trigger a physical reaction, much of the concern regarding cyberattacks surrounds a state’s loss or destruction of data.⁵⁷ Second, even using the more expansive definitions of *force* that focus on the attack’s consequences presented by Schmitt and the Tallinn Manual, the threshold for these factors is unclear. For example, the Estonia DDoS attack⁵⁸ merely caused confusion and unrest, even though the attack was on Estonia’s infrastructure.⁵⁹ Under Schmitt’s and the Manual’s framework, would the Estonia cyberattack rise to the level of armed force, even though its consequences were minimal and trivial?⁶⁰ The answer is unclear, considering the ambiguous definitions and traditional understanding of “armed force.” Even using broad interpretations of “force,” many ambiguities surround applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks. Applying Article 51 to cyberattacks is also problematic due to the issue of attribution. Attribution is a crucial step to claims of self-defense under Article 51.⁶¹ A state must know the perpetrator’s identity to retaliate under Article 51.⁶² Cyberattacks are distinguishable from conventional attacks because there are no soldiers, physical presence, or weapons to determine the",

However, what if a state believes it knows which state launched the attack? Under the current laws of war, nothing prevents a state from using the right of self-defense in this scenario.⁶⁶ It is unclear if a state would be justified in launching a retaliatory armed attack if it was mistaken as to the attacker's identity. Along these lines of retaliation, the type of force a state may use in retaliation is also ambiguous. Using the example of the severe DDoS attack against the U.S., the question is: Provided the U.S. knows which state perpetuated the attack, could the U.S. launch its own attack against the state and cripple that state's infrastructure? The U.S. would be bound to retaliate using another \"pure cyberattack\" (meaning no physical effect), considering the principles of necessity and proportionality.⁶⁷ However, what if, for some reason, a \"pure cyberattack\" was not a viable option for the U.S.? Could the U.S. respond with physical force, or must it forego its right of self-defense? Once again, the current laws of war do not answer this question. Another problematic element of the laws of war is that non-state actors cannot violate Article 2(4) because it applies only to state actors.⁶⁸ It is common practice for governments to contract individuals or groups of hackers to attack states.⁶⁹ If a non-state actor carries out a cyberattack, the attacked state cannot enjoy the right of self-defense under Article 51.

Estonia DDoS Attack In 2007, Estonia became the first victim of a cyberattack sponsored by a state actor.70 The cyberattacks were in response to the Estonian government's choice to relocate a Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn.71 The type of attack utilized was the Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\"), one of the most commonly used cyberattacks.72 DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a site with fake requests to the point that the site cannot respond to all requests, and subsequently, the site crashes.73 The DDoS attacks targeted the Estonian \"government and parliamentary portals, ministries, news outlets, internet service providers, major banks, and small businesses.\"74 These attacks profoundly affected Estonia's infrastructure due to the state's heavy reliance on the Internet.75 This tiny nation, dubbed e-Estonia, is at the forefront of e-democracy76 and is recognized as the world's most advanced digital society.77 The sites of the two biggest Estonian banks were offline for about forty-five to ninety minutes, blocking access to simple financial tasks such as accessing or transferring money.78 Also, the",

Balancing all the elements, Schmitt concludes, “the incident arguably reached the use-of-force threshold.”91 Interestingly, Reese Nguyen comes to the opposite conclusion using this same framework on the Estonian cyberattacks.92 Nguyen claims (1) the cyberattacks were not that severe due to lack of injury and destruction; (2) the consequences were delayed; (3) the effects were not directly tied to the DDoS attacks; (4) there was minimal invasion due to the remote execution of the cyberattacks; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify; and (6) since the attacks were legitimate because they were limited to telecommunication systems.93 Using the same (widely accepted94) framework to determine whether a cyberattack amounts to the “use of force” and reaching contradictory conclusions exposes the inadequacy of applying jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the contradictory framework of Article 2(4), applying Article 51 to the Estonian cyberattacks would also be problematic.

Applying Article 51’s use of self-defense might not be problematic in this instance because the cyberattacks against Ukraine have already been attributed to Russia, and it is clear any further cyberattacks will also be attributed to the Russian government. The familiar problem would be applying Article 2(4). The definition of “armed force” is extremely limited and traditionally includes only physical force and effects. However, considering more modern interpretations of “armed force,” an argument could be made that the consequences of Russia’s cyberattack are not minimal. If Russia plans to ramp up its cyberwarfare, Russia may be successful at shutting down Ukraine’s electric grid as it has tried in the past. As mentioned before, the ambiguity of what constitutes “armed force” makes it difficult to apply this law. However, an attack of this magnitude may be enough to trigger Article 2(4), regardless of any physical destruction. ¹¹⁵. Brumfield, supra note 109. ¹¹⁶.

China In its 2023 Annual Threat Assessment, U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) opined that “China remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to the U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks.”¹²⁰ For decades, the People’s Republic of China has engaged in malicious cyberattacks against U.S. institutions, “including healthcare, financial services, defense industrial base, energy, government facilities, chemical, critical manufacturing (including automotive and aerospace), communications, IT (including managed service providers), international trade, education, video gaming, faith-based organizations, and law firms.”¹²¹ According to data from CrowdStrike, China was responsible for sixty-seven percent of state-sponsored cyberattacks “motivated both by intellectual property (IP) theft and intelligence gathering objectives” in 2021.¹²² Compared with just seven percent for the Iranian government and one percent for the Russian government, China’s stunning cyber involvement presents the biggest threat to U.S. business and government.¹²³ China’s malicious cyberattacks came to the forefront with Operation Aurora in January 2010.¹²⁴ Operation Aurora was a series of attacks from China that compromised many U.S. companies such as Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical, and Google.¹²⁵ Google was the only company to publicly come forward and announce that the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists had been compromised.¹²⁶ As a result of this attack and --- ¹²⁰. *People’s Republic of China Cyber Threat*, CYBERSECURITY &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE SEC.

An Iranian intelligence agency hacker broke into a Dutch Security Company, called DigiNotar, and issued fraudulent encryption certificates, which allowed the Iran to spy on all Iranian Gmail users.¹³⁸ The hacker breached the company by adding a rule in a router that forced Google's traffic through another route inside the country.¹³⁹ While most victims of Iran's cyberattacks are Iranian or surrounding countries, Iran has carried out major cyberattacks on U.S. banks.¹⁴⁰ In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment of \"seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam (ITSEC) and Mersad Company (MERSAD), that performed work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on computer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\"¹⁴¹ The DDoS attacks allowed the hackers access to forty-six financial institutions, including \"Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&amp;T and HSBC.\"¹⁴² Some days, the cyberattacks overwhelmed computer servers with as",

Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin added thousands of satellites to the Earth's low orbit.¹⁵⁴ For example, SpaceX plans to send over 40,000 Starlink satellites into space to provide low-cost Internet to remote areas worldwide.¹⁵⁵ With more plans to launch satellites from SpaceX and other companies, comes more demand for building satellites cheaper and faster.¹⁵⁶ The rapid building of satellites is of increasing interest¹⁵⁷ due to the possibility of companies cutting corners to decrease costs and speed up production.¹⁵⁸ The commercial space industry boom has opened the door for more cyberattacks. There are more non-government space actors than ever, and the highly technical aspect of building satellites allows multiple manufacturers to be involved in a single satellite.¹⁵⁹ These new realities create new targets along an extensive supply chain that companies and governments are not currently equipped to handle.",

Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] enforcement's access to digital evidence, and strengthening procedural safeguards and human rights provisions.¹⁸² There has been an international treaty on cybercrime for over twenty years, and another one is forthcoming. Why is there no international treaty on cross-border cyberattacks sponsored by state actors? The answer is embedded in politics and conflicting state interests. ## A. Defining Cyberattack The first step to drafting a successful International Cyber Treaty will be defining a cyberattack. Without a cohesive, agreed-upon definition of cyberattack, it is challenging to differentiate cyberattacks from cybercrime and cyberespionage.¹⁸³ The definition of cyberattack should be specific and concise, leaving no room for interpretation. Making the definition of a cyberattack too broad may open the door for differing interpretations and further disagreements.¹⁸⁴ While the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyberattack is a good starting point, its effect-based approach is problematic for several reasons.¹⁸⁵ First, the definition focuses on the cyberattack causing injury, death, or destruction to objects. Most cyberattacks do not cause such effects but rather result in, among other things, data loss and server disruption.¹⁸⁶ For example, the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused financial losses and general inconvenience to the public, but there was no injury, death, or destruction to objects.¹⁸⁷ Another issue with the Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattack is that it does not address the intent to cause injury, death, or destruction to objects. For instance, consider a Russian-sponsored cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, hoping to destroy it. If, for some reason, the cyberattack is not accomplished, it would not be deemed a \"cyberattack\" under the Tallinn Manual. A state actor should be held accountable for failed or uncompleted cyberattacks because the state intended to cause",

More importantly, the definition of cyberattack should be broad enough to capture the different ways a cyberattack can be carried out but also specific enough not to leave room for differing interpretations. ## B. Clear Attribution and Defense Guidelines Attribution is deemed to be the most challenging aspect of cyberattacks.¹⁸⁸ The Cyber Treaty must establish elements needed to attribute a cyberattack to the wrongdoing state. Along with the elements of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should outline the evidence a state must present to prove attribution. Evidence may include IP addresses, information from political sources, similarities to malware with known actors, the temporal proximity of similar cyberattacks, and using a “honeypot” to identify actors.¹⁸⁹ With these guidelines in place, states should no longer be able to shift responsibility to groups or individuals hired to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹⁰ Moreover, attribution is crucial for a state’s legitimate claim of self-defense.¹⁹¹ Accordingly, the Cyber Treaty should outline how a state may defend itself in a cyberattack. It is important to clarify what kind of attack a state may retaliate with, whether purely cyber or a mixed attack. These guidelines should still be in accordance with the international principles of necessity and proportionality discussed previously. ## C. Inclusion of Non-State Actors Along the same lines of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should encompass the actions of non-state actors as cyberattacks. The laws of war do not apply to non-state actors, which is problematic when states employ groups or individuals to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹² It is hypothesized that non-state actors could violate the laws of war if a “clear relationship” exists with a state. --- ¹⁸⁸. See Simmons, supra note 13, at 100. ¹⁸⁹. See Nguyen, supra note 93, at 1105. ¹⁹⁰. See discussion supra Section III.A. ¹⁹¹. See Moore, supra note 21, at 242. ¹⁹². See discussion supra Section II.B.3. Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] 193 However, it is unclear what constitutes a clear relationship. Using the 2007 Estonia DDoS cyberattacks as an example, there is definitive proof of Russian government involvement, but is this enough to form a \"clear relationship\"? The Russian government certainly does not think so,¹⁹⁴ which is why this framework is not very useful. Instead, the Cyber Treaty should focus on state responsibility for the actions of non-state actors. First and foremost, a cyberattack must be considered state conduct if a state sponsors a cyberattack. More importantly, states should be held responsible for the acts of non-actors, especially when states knowingly allow \"its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"¹⁹⁵ Such a rule would hold states like Russia responsible for the acts of Russian hackers that carry out thousands of cyberattacks.¹⁹⁶ This framework would also remove the ability of states to claim plausible deniability for the actions of others because any cyberattack carried out within a state's territory would be the state's responsibility. Going further, even if there is no state involvement, the state should still be held responsible for not taking the appropriate measures to stop the attacks. ## D. Possibility of an International Cyber Treaty While the idea of a Cyber Treaty is conceptually solid, many forces make its adoption uncertain in the real world. International politics and conflicting state interests play a vital role in the making and passing of international law.¹⁹⁷ A viable Cyber Treaty will require states with different views on cyberattacks to come together and agree on its terms.¹⁹⁸ Although not all UN member",

Conflicting State Interests The key players in the Cyber Treaty are Russia, China, and the U.S. Each state has different cyber goals. For example, Russia focuses on cyber policies that support state sovereignty and the ability to keep citizen loyalties in check.¹⁹⁹ China has similar goals as Russia and emphasizes the importance of preemptive cyberattacks.²⁰⁰ Meanwhile, the U.S. is focused on cooperation between international law enforcement agencies to stop cyberattacks and apprehend cybercriminals.²⁰¹ Despite multiple efforts by the Russian government²⁰² to reach an agreement on cyber matters with the U.S., the U.S. remains apprehensive about Russia's intentions, and with good reason.²⁰³ Although the U.S. and Russia have not agreed on most cyber issues, in 2015, Russia and China entered into a bilateral cyber treaty that pledges neither state will launch a cyberattack against the other.²⁰⁴ While this treaty only binds Russia and China, it marks a first step toward an International Cyber Treaty.

Moving Past the Politics Russia and the U.S. had even more significant ideological differences during the Cold War.²⁰⁶ Though cyberattacks cause catastrophic effects on the economy, infrastructure, supply chains, and more,²⁰⁷ the severity of the Cold War cannot be compared. The Cold War was not just a space race but also a nuclear arms race between the U.S. and Russia.²⁰⁸ These two nations were actively developing weapons of mass destruction and threatening each other with nuclear attacks.²⁰⁹ However, during the height of the Cold War, important agreements were reached, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere) and the Outer Space Treaty (outlawing weapons of mass destruction in outer space).²¹⁰ If the U.S. and Russia reached agreements during such tense and terrifying times, it should be possible to do the same in today's world. An International Cyber Treaty that provides rules and guidance on cyberattacks would benefit both countries and promote stability in the \"fifth battlespace.\"²¹¹ ## E.

Though some nations, namely Russia, that are part of these groups work with other experts to develop these guidelines, it is clear the rules are not being followed by the member-states. While the reports serve as important guiding principles all states should follow, the reality is they are not being properly adhered to. This is another reason why a Cyber Treaty is needed. There is only so much that non-binding norms and U.N. resolutions will do in getting states to cooperate with proper cyber behavior.",

In the coming years, this Group should further develop norms and rules for existing and potential cyber threats that are persuasive enough for states to follow. ## VI. CONCLUSION This Comment focused on the application of the laws of war to cyberattacks. While there is no question the laws of war codified in the UN Charter apply to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient in practice. Issues arise due to the nature of cyberattacks and the traditional definitions of \"force\" and \"armed attack.\" Moreover, there is difficulty in applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks due to proper state attribution and the exclusion of non-state actors. These challenges can be addressed by a Cyber Treaty negotiated by the three key players: the U.S., China, and Russia. Although the cyber interests and goals of the U.S. are different from those of Russia and China, the differences should not render a Cyber Treaty impossible. Much like during the Cold War with the passing of the Outer Space Treaty, the first step is to put politics behind and realize creating a Cyber Treaty could benefit all. ²²⁴. Id. ²²⁵.

INTRODUCTION Approximately ninety-two cyberattacks will occur during the time it takes to read this article. A University of Maryland study found that, on average, there is one cyberattack every thirty-nine seconds around the world.² This haunting statistic puts into perspective the magnitude of international cybercrime. It explains why 156 nations, including the United States, Russia, China, and Iran, have taken measures to combat the ever-increasing problem of cybercrime.³ What happens, however, when nations perpetuate cybercrime against other nations? These so-called cross-border, aggressive, state-sponsored cyberattacks are an increasing international problem. Since 2005, there have been at least 247 cyberattacks sponsored by China, 174 by Russia, 97 by Iran, and\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nThis comment examines the applicability of current international laws of war to cross-border attacks sponsored by state actors. It is apparent that the laws of the United Nations' (\"UN\") Charter are insufficient to address cyberattacks. The international arena must devote its efforts to working on an International Cyber Treaty (\"Cyber Treaty\") that addresses state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Cyber Treaty should clarify conflicting standards and fill gaps in current international law. This comment examines the feasibility of the Cyber Treaty considering the key players' conflicting interests.\nPart II addresses the *jus ad bellum* principles of international law: UN Charter Articles 2(4) and 51 and their applicability to cyber-attacks. Part III examines the Russian-sponsored 2007 Estonia Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\") Attack and its applicability to the laws of war. Part IV highlights the intersection between cybersecurity and outer space, including the increasing concern for satellite cyberattacks. Moreover, this Part discusses the differences and similarities between the legal instruments of space law and cyber law. Part V proposes an International Cyber Treaty that fills in the gaps left by applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## II. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ATTACKS ### A. Applicable International Law The UN is the most influential international organization that creates and codifies international law.⁶ The UN Charter contains Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] many significant laws, including Article 2(4),7 arguably one of the most important rules of modern international law.8 Articles 2(4) and (51)9 of the UN Charter codify the international law concept of *jus ad bellum*, which is the international law governing states going to war (“laws of war”). The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations10 (“Tallinn Manual” or “Manual”) defines *jus ad bellum* as “international law governing a State’s resort to force as an instrument of its national policy.”11 Plainly stated, this principle lays out the circumstances under which states could permissibly go to war. The core of *jus ad bellum* lies in the general prohibition against states using force on one another, found in Article 2(4), coupled with two exceptions in Articles 39 and 51. Working together with *jus ad bellum* is the international law principle of *jus in bello*, which governs a state’s conduct once already engaged in war.12 Applying *jus in bello* to cyberattacks is also a complex discussion topic that has earned scholars’ attention. This comment, however, focuses on applying *jus ad bellum* only to cyberattacks.\n## 1. Threat or Use of Force Article 2(4) of the UN Charter declares that: All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or in developing nations). But see Julia Zorthian, *5 United Nations Achievements Worth Celebrating on U.N. Day*, TIME (Oct. 23, 2015, 6:20PM), https://time.com/4085757/united-nations-achievements/. (listing major UN accomplishments including pyramid preservation, smallpox eradication, and arms control promotion).\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nThe age-old question is: What did the UN mean by\"force\"?14 The answer is, of course, it depends. Before diving into the different interpretations of the word\"force,\"it is helpful to understand the historical events that led to the adoption of Article 2(4). The core of Article 2(4) traces back to the end of World War I when the League of Nations declared that\"any war or threat of war\"was of concern to the world.15 The development of Article 2(4) continued with the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which condemned states resorting to war and ended in 1945 with the formal signing of the UN Charter, formally establishing the UN and articulating Article 2(4).16 The events leading up to the formal recitation of Article 2(4) include the two World Wars, which along with the UN's aim\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\"17 suggests a focus on the use of force by way of military instruments.18 This determination also paves the way for the dominant view that Article 2(4) prohibits physical armed force only, as opposed to, for example, force as coercion.19 It is generally accepted and historically understood that force under Article 2(4) requires\"armed force.\"20 In support of this view, the UN Charter's preamble states that\"armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.\"21 In addition, Article 51 Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] (discussed below) references self-defense against armed attacks.²² The problem with this strict interpretation is that only instances of military violence would violate Article 2(4), and states may only exercise the right of self-defense under Article 51 from armed military violence of another state.²³ ## 2. Exceptions to Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the use of force is subject to two exceptions: force may be allowed if the UN Security Council determines such force is needed to restore the peace²⁴ and if a state is acting in self-defense.²⁵ Article 51 codifies the latter exception providing that: [n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.²⁶ The UN left the term\"armed attack\"undefined, which leads to competing interpretations of the term's intended meaning.²⁷ What is clear from Article 51 is that the right of self-defense is based on principles of necessity and proportionality.²⁸ A state's use of force under Article 2(4) might be legitimate under Article 51 only if there was an armed attack before the claim of self-defense, meaning Article 51 does not protect preemptive state attacks.²⁹ ## B. Applicability and Sufficiency of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks Before applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks, it is necessary first to define a cyberattack. Starting with what a cyberattack is not, a cyberattack is not the same thing as\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nRegarding the application of Articles 2(4) and 51, there is increasing agreement among states and scholars that these rules apply to cyberattacks.³⁷ States in agreement include the United States, the United Kingdom, and Estonia.³⁸ The Tallinn Manual Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] also supports this conclusion: “[b]oth International Groups of Experts were unanimous in their estimation that existing international law applies to cyber operations.”³⁹ Difficulties arise when applying the laws of war to cyberattacks due to the traditional language of the Articles.⁴⁰ It is through no fault of their own, however, that the UN’s founders did not foresee the current modern digital world and the possibility of cyberattacks before the signing of the UN Charter in 1945. In fact, the International Court of Justice declared that Articles 2(4) and 51 “appl[y] to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed” in their analysis of whether the use of nuclear weapons constituted force.⁴¹ As such, the inquiry is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies to cyberattacks but *how* to successfully apply these traditional law principles to this non-traditional weapon. The difficulty of applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks lies in the attacks’ nature.⁴² Cyberattacks are virtual, complex, anonymous, and can cause catastrophic injury to millions, potentially billions, of people, with some simple lines of code.⁴³ The unique features of cyberattacks pose difficulties when applying the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack,” leading to the conclusion that the current laws of war may be insufficient to confront this problem.⁴⁴ Concerning force under Article 2(4), the primary consideration is whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force required under the traditional definition. There are six helpful factors to determine whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force.⁴⁵ These factors are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and-international-law-in-the-21st-century); Kersti Kaljulaid, Former President of the Republic of Estonia, Remarks at the Opening of CyCon 2019 (May 29, 2019) (stating “[w]e believe and state that both the rights and obligations of international law, including those stated in the U.N. Charter, do apply to states when using IT and communication technologies”).\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## 2. Exceptions to the Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Revisited\nLikewise, Article 51 also begs the question of whether a cyberattack rises to the level of an armed attack required for a state to enjoy the right of self-defense. Article 51 is seemingly narrower than Article 2(4), meaning that not all uses of force qualify as armed attacks.⁵⁰ There are three factors to consider whether a cyberattack constitutes an “armed attack.”⁵¹ These factors include the consequences of the attack, the state’s consideration of aggressive intent, and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack.⁵² Consistent with the meaning of armed force under Article 2(4), the consequences of an armed attack must rise to a certain level in severity for a state to be justified in using self-defense.⁵³ Using these factors, a severe DDoS attack against the United States that cripples infrastructure would be considered armed force due to the severity.⁵⁴ In this scenario, the United States can respond with an armed force to defend itself, granted it abides by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and the attack can be attributed to a state actor.⁵⁵ A state’s right to use\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] armed force after a cyberattack raises the question of what type of force it may use to defend itself, which this Comment addresses in the proceeding Section.\n## 3. Application of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks is Insufficient While it is possible to apply *jus ad bellum* to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient to regulate cyberattacks due to the traditional interpretation of the laws. One of the most significant difficulties in applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks is that the traditional definition of “armed force” focuses on force carried out physically and having a physical effect, such as a conventional bomb.⁵⁶ This interpretation would be too narrow for cyberattacks, considering the non-physical nature of cyberattacks. Although a cyberattack may trigger a physical reaction, much of the concern regarding cyberattacks surrounds a state’s loss or destruction of data.⁵⁷ Second, even using the more expansive definitions of *force* that focus on the attack’s consequences presented by Schmitt and the Tallinn Manual, the threshold for these factors is unclear. For example, the Estonia DDoS attack⁵⁸ merely caused confusion and unrest, even though the attack was on Estonia’s infrastructure.⁵⁹ Under Schmitt’s and the Manual’s framework, would the Estonia cyberattack rise to the level of armed force, even though its consequences were minimal and trivial?⁶⁰ The answer is unclear, considering the ambiguous definitions and traditional understanding of “armed force.” Even using broad interpretations of “force,” many ambiguities surround applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks.\nApplying Article 51 to cyberattacks is also problematic due to the issue of attribution. Attribution is a crucial step to claims of self-defense under Article 51.⁶¹ A state must know the perpetrator’s identity to retaliate under Article 51.⁶² Cyberattacks are distinguishable from conventional attacks because there are no soldiers, physical presence, or weapons to determine the\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nAlong these lines of retaliation, the type of force a state may use in retaliation is also ambiguous. Using the example of the severe DDoS attack against the U.S., the question is: Provided the U.S. knows which state perpetuated the attack, could the U.S. launch its own attack against the state and cripple that state's infrastructure? The U.S. would be bound to retaliate using another\"pure cyberattack\"(meaning no physical effect), considering the principles of necessity and proportionality.⁶⁷ However, what if, for some reason, a\"pure cyberattack\"was not a viable option for the U.S.? Could the U.S. respond with physical force, or must it forego its right of self-defense? Once again, the current laws of war do not answer this question.\nAnother problematic element of the laws of war is that non-state actors cannot violate Article 2(4) because it applies only to state actors.⁶⁸ It is common practice for governments to contract individuals or groups of hackers to attack states.⁶⁹ If a non-state actor carries out a cyberattack, the attacked state cannot enjoy the right of self-defense under Article 51. In addition, under the current principles of jus ad bellum, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda may launch cyberattacks against states with (in theory) no retaliation since al-Qaeda is not a state actor. Once again, this Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] appears to be the wrong conclusion, especially considering the large number of non-state actors that launch cyberattacks.\n## III. CROSS-BORDER AGGRESSIVE CYBERATTACKS BETWEEN STATE ACTORS ### A. Estonia DDoS Attack In 2007, Estonia became the first victim of a cyberattack sponsored by a state actor.70 The cyberattacks were in response to the Estonian government's choice to relocate a Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn.71 The type of attack utilized was the Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\"), one of the most commonly used cyberattacks.72 DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a site with fake requests to the point that the site cannot respond to all requests, and subsequently, the site crashes.73 The DDoS attacks targeted the Estonian\"government and parliamentary portals, ministries, news outlets, internet service providers, major banks, and small businesses.\"74 These attacks profoundly affected Estonia's infrastructure due to the state's heavy reliance on the Internet.75 This tiny nation, dubbed e-Estonia, is at the forefront of e-democracy76 and is recognized as the world's most advanced digital society.77 The sites of the two biggest Estonian banks were offline for about forty-five to ninety minutes, blocking access to simple financial tasks such as accessing or transferring money.78 Also, the\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nRegarding responsibility, no concrete evidence exists attributing the cyberattack to a state. However, there is information available to suggest that Russia could have been at least indirectly responsible for the attacks.⁸⁰ Evidence of Russian responsibility included IP addresses tracing back to the computers of Russian government agencies, the Russian government's refusal to assist the Estonian government in resolving the attacks,⁸¹ and DDoS online attack instructions written in Russian.⁸² Furthermore, Russia severed commercially important railways with no prior notice for alleged repairs during the attacks.⁸³ While the Russian government completely denies responsibility,⁸⁴ the overwhelming evidence points to some Russian government orchestration, especially considering the funding needed for such attacks.⁸⁵ However, since no\"smoking gun\"proves Russian government involvement, it is difficult to attribute the attack to Russia properly. There was, however, one conviction in connection with the cyberattacks. Dmitri Galuškevits, an Estonian student of Russian origin, was convicted for targeting a political party's website.⁸⁶ The size of the operation suggests many others were responsible for the attacks, however, due to Russia's non-cooperation, the rest remain without any repercussions.⁸⁷ Applying the laws of war to the Estonian cyberattacks yields contradicting results, showing exactly why another solution is Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] needed. Michael Schmitt applies his “use of force” framework and concludes that the Estonian cyberattacks rose to the level of “armed force.”88 Schmitt cites the severe consequences of the attack, such as the disruption of government function and services, economic turmoil, and adverse effects on the Estonian people.89 Likewise, Schmitt reasons the attacks were immediate, direct, invasive, and presumably illegitimate.90 Schmitt concedes there is difficulty quantifying the consequences of the cyberattack as the only factor opposing the conclusion. Balancing all the elements, Schmitt concludes, “the incident arguably reached the use-of-force threshold.”91 Interestingly, Reese Nguyen comes to the opposite conclusion using this same framework on the Estonian cyberattacks.92 Nguyen claims (1) the cyberattacks were not that severe due to lack of injury and destruction; (2) the consequences were delayed; (3) the effects were not directly tied to the DDoS attacks; (4) there was minimal invasion due to the remote execution of the cyberattacks; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify; and (6) since the attacks were legitimate because they were limited to telecommunication systems.93 Using the same (widely accepted94) framework to determine whether a cyberattack amounts to the “use of force” and reaching contradictory conclusions exposes the inadequacy of applying jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the contradictory framework of Article 2(4), applying Article 51 to the Estonian cyberattacks would also be problematic. Since the cyberattacks were not adequately attributed to Russia, Estonia could not use the right of self-defense outlined in Article 51. Even more problematic is that the cyberattacks against Estonia were carried out by non-state actors, meaning Articles 2(4) and 51 would not apply to them.\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nAnother aspect of this cyberattack is the implication of NATO Article 5,⁹⁵ which would evoke a collective defensive response against Russia from NATO members.⁹⁶ Some experts speculate that the Russian government purposefully fell short of the threshold for invoking Article 5 due to the severe repercussions it may face from NATO's collective defense.⁹⁷ While Article 5 was not invoked in the Estonia cyberattacks, it is clear that NATO will defend its allies against a cyberattack.⁹⁸ Article 5 serves as another layer of defense for NATO countries against serious cyberattacks, a resource that should be used more often.\n## B. Cyberattacks Between Russia and Ukraine While there is a physical war between Russian and Ukraine,⁹⁹ the battle is also occurring in cyberspace. Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine began as early as 2014.¹⁰⁰ Three days before the referendum vote on the status of Crimea, Russia launched an eight-minute DDoS cyberattack against Ukraine to\"destabilize communications and spread confusion whilst troops overran the region.\"¹⁰¹ Also in 2014, a pro-Russian hacking group carried out cyberattacks to manipulate voting in the Ukrainian presidential election.¹⁰² The hackers targeted the Central Election Commission in an attempt to change election results.¹⁰³ More notably, in 2015 Russia carried out another DDoS attack that affected energy Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] distribution companies and left over 230,000 Ukrainian citizens without power for one-to-six hours.¹⁰⁴ The infamous Russian hacking group, Sandworm, is attributed to this cyberattack.¹⁰⁵ The destructive attack is believed to be the first example of a power outage caused by a cyberattack.¹⁰⁶ The malware used in this attack is called “BlackEnergy,” a malware also known to have compromised NATO, many Western European countries, and energy companies.¹⁰⁷ Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, cyberattacks from Russia soared in early 2022.¹⁰⁸ On January 14, 2022, Russian hackers brought down seventy Ukrainian government websites, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education.¹⁰⁹ Before the sites went down, a message appeared in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish that read “Prepare for the worst” and warned Ukrainian citizens, “All your personal data has been sent to a public network. All data on your computer is destroyed and cannot be recovered.”¹¹⁰ Right before the invasion on February 14, 2022, a DDoS attack targeted websites of Ukraine’s armed forces, public radio, and two of the biggest national banks.¹¹¹ The cyberattack brought down the banks for two hours and rendered the mobile apps and online payments inoperable.¹¹² Following Russia’s invasion, a number of cyberattacks ensued, including the KA-SAT satellite network¹¹³ and more cyberattacks on Ukraine’s digital infrastructure blocking access to financial services and energy.¹¹⁴ Another notable interruption includes a cyberattack on a Ukrainian radio station\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nWhile Ukraine has been successful at fighting off the bombardment of cyberattacks since the Russian invasion, experts are speculating that Russia may be holding back¹¹⁶ and is set to escalate its cyberattacks against Ukraine.¹¹⁷ In its February 2023 Threat Analysis Group, Google assessed Russia will “increase disruptive and destructive attacks in response to developments on the battlefield that fundamentally shift the balance... toward Ukraine.”¹¹⁸ Cyber threat group, Recorded Future, also noted in its February 2023 report that “in the near term, Russia will very likely launch a renewed offensive in Ukraine.”¹¹⁹ If the prediction of increased cyberattacks is true, invoking Articles 2(4) and 51 should be considered. Applying Article 51’s use of self-defense might not be problematic in this instance because the cyberattacks against Ukraine have already been attributed to Russia, and it is clear any further cyberattacks will also be attributed to the Russian government. The familiar problem would be applying Article 2(4). The definition of “armed force” is extremely limited and traditionally includes only physical force and effects. However, considering more modern interpretations of “armed force,” an argument could be made that the consequences of Russia’s cyberattack are not minimal. If Russia plans to ramp up its cyberwarfare, Russia may be successful at shutting down Ukraine’s electric grid as it has tried in the past. As mentioned before, the ambiguity of what constitutes “armed force” makes it difficult to apply this law. However, an attack of this magnitude may be enough to trigger Article 2(4), regardless of any physical destruction.\n¹¹⁵. Brumfield, supra note 109.\n¹¹⁶.

Threats from China and Iran ### 1. China In its 2023 Annual Threat Assessment, U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) opined that “China remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to the U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks.”¹²⁰ For decades, the People’s Republic of China has engaged in malicious cyberattacks against U.S. institutions, “including healthcare, financial services, defense industrial base, energy, government facilities, chemical, critical manufacturing (including automotive and aerospace), communications, IT (including managed service providers), international trade, education, video gaming, faith-based organizations, and law firms.”¹²¹ According to data from CrowdStrike, China was responsible for sixty-seven percent of state-sponsored cyberattacks “motivated both by intellectual property (IP) theft and intelligence gathering objectives” in 2021.¹²² Compared with just seven percent for the Iranian government and one percent for the Russian government, China’s stunning cyber involvement presents the biggest threat to U.S. business and government.¹²³ China’s malicious cyberattacks came to the forefront with Operation Aurora in January 2010.¹²⁴ Operation Aurora was a series of attacks from China that compromised many U.S. companies such as Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical, and Google.¹²⁵ Google was the only company to publicly come forward and announce that the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists had been compromised.¹²⁶ As a result of this attack and --- ¹²⁰. *People’s Republic of China Cyber Threat*, CYBERSECURITY &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE SEC.

An Iranian intelligence agency hacker broke into a Dutch Security Company, called DigiNotar, and issued fraudulent encryption certificates, which allowed the Iran to spy on all Iranian Gmail users.¹³⁸ The hacker breached the company by adding a rule in a router that forced Google's traffic through another route inside the country.¹³⁹ While most victims of Iran's cyberattacks are Iranian or surrounding countries, Iran has carried out major cyberattacks on U.S. banks.¹⁴⁰ In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment of\"seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam (ITSEC) and Mersad Company (MERSAD), that performed work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on computer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\"¹⁴¹ The DDoS attacks allowed the hackers access to forty-six financial institutions, including\"Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&amp;T and HSBC.\"¹⁴² Some days, the cyberattacks overwhelmed computer servers with as\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## IV. SPACE LAW CONSIDERATIONS\n### A. Applicability of Cybersecurity in Outer Space\nWhile pairing cyberspace and outer space together may be unusual, the two are inextricably connected. Essential outer space services like the GPS require complex technology and software.¹⁴⁵ It is this very same reliance technology that exposes space objects to cyberattacks.¹⁴⁶\n#### 1. Satellites\nCyberattacks against outer space satellites are of increasing concern due to the consequences such an attack would have on everyday life.¹⁴⁷ Satellites are used for banking, power grids, farming, military defense, television programming, weather services, and more.¹⁴⁸ A successful cyberattack on a satellite could threaten a country's power grid or leave millions of people without communication services.¹⁴⁹ Some new satellites are equipped with \"thrusters\" and can be steered.¹⁵⁰ If such a satellite was hacked, its\n¹⁴³.

Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin added thousands of satellites to the Earth's low orbit.¹⁵⁴ For example, SpaceX plans to send over 40,000 Starlink satellites into space to provide low-cost Internet to remote areas worldwide.¹⁵⁵ With more plans to launch satellites from SpaceX and other companies, comes more demand for building satellites cheaper and faster.¹⁵⁶ The rapid building of satellites is of increasing interest¹⁵⁷ due to the possibility of companies cutting corners to decrease costs and speed up production.¹⁵⁸ The commercial space industry boom has opened the door for more cyberattacks. There are more non-government space actors than ever, and the highly technical aspect of building satellites allows multiple manufacturers to be involved in a single satellite.¹⁵⁹ These new realities create new targets along an extensive supply chain that companies and governments are not currently equipped to handle.\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nOne example of the consequences a cyberattack may have on a satellite comes via the Viasat KA-SAT case. On February 24, 2022, the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a cyberattack was launched against Viasat's KA-SAT satellite broadband service.¹⁶⁰ The cyberattack impacted the internet access of tens of thousands of Ukrainian and EU citizens and severed the remote monitoring access of 5,800 wind turbines of a German energy company.¹⁶¹ The malware used to carry out the attacks is called\"AcidRain,\"designed to remotely\"wipe modems and routers.\"¹⁶² The AcidRain malware bears coding similarities with another malware previously attributed to Russia's Sandworm group.¹⁶³ This piece of evidence, along with the suspicious timing of the cyberattack, leads many to conclude Russia sponsored the cyberattack.¹⁶⁴ The U.S. formally attributed the satellite cyberattack to Russia in a press statement by the Secretary of State.¹⁶⁵ While the U.S., E.U., and other countries condemned the cyberattacks, there was no discussion of its applicability to Articles 2(4) and 51, nor NATO Article 5 repercussions.¹⁶⁶ Such inaction to punish Russia continues to set a dangerous precedent of allowing state-sponsored malicious cyberattacks.\n¹⁶⁰.

W32.Gammima.AG Virus on the International Space Station In 2008, Windows XP laptops on the International Space Station (ISS) were infected with a virus called W32.Gammima.AG.¹⁶⁷ The virus was linked to Russian astronauts who carried infected USB devices on the ISS and spread the computer virus to infected computers.¹⁶⁸ Although the virus is considered a low-level threat, the ability of a computer to become affected in the ISS exposed the flaws of the computers at the stations and their vulnerabilities to attacks.¹⁶⁹ Following the vulnerability, the United Space Allowance changed the computer systems on the ISS from Windows XP to Linux for more security.¹⁷⁰ ## B. Differences Between the Landscape of Space Law and Cyber Law One lesson cyberspace can learn from space comes from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.¹⁷¹ This treaty, negotiated at the height of the Cold War, codified important space principles still used today. The Outer Space Treaty declares that the exploration and use of outer space “shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries”¹⁷² and that outer space is free for exploration by all states.¹⁷³ However, it also limits some state activity, such as claims over outer space and celestial bodies,¹⁷⁴ and expressly prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in outer space.¹⁷⁵ While the Outer Space Treaty has not escaped\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## V. INTERNATIONAL CYBER TREATY\nThough it may be difficult to envision a Cyber Treaty that addresses the issues outlined in this Comment, European countries agreed to a comprehensive international cybercrime treaty in 2001.¹⁸⁰ The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”), among many other things, defines criminal offenses for cybercrime and establishes domestic procedures for prosecuting computer crimes.¹⁸¹ Moreover, the UN is working on another major Cybercrime Convention to deal with topics like international cooperation on cybercrime, law\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] enforcement's access to digital evidence, and strengthening procedural safeguards and human rights provisions.¹⁸² There has been an international treaty on cybercrime for over twenty years, and another one is forthcoming. Why is there no international treaty on cross-border cyberattacks sponsored by state actors? The answer is embedded in politics and conflicting state interests.\n## A. Defining Cyberattack The first step to drafting a successful International Cyber Treaty will be defining a cyberattack. Without a cohesive, agreed-upon definition of cyberattack, it is challenging to differentiate cyberattacks from cybercrime and cyberespionage.¹⁸³ The definition of cyberattack should be specific and concise, leaving no room for interpretation. Making the definition of a cyberattack too broad may open the door for differing interpretations and further disagreements.¹⁸⁴ While the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyberattack is a good starting point, its effect-based approach is problematic for several reasons.¹⁸⁵ First, the definition focuses on the cyberattack causing injury, death, or destruction to objects. Most cyberattacks do not cause such effects but rather result in, among other things, data loss and server disruption.¹⁸⁶ For example, the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused financial losses and general inconvenience to the public, but there was no injury, death, or destruction to objects.¹⁸⁷ Another issue with the Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattack is that it does not address the intent to cause injury, death, or destruction to objects. For instance, consider a Russian-sponsored cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, hoping to destroy it. If, for some reason, the cyberattack is not accomplished, it would not be deemed a\"cyberattack\"under the Tallinn Manual. A state actor should be held accountable for failed or uncompleted cyberattacks because the state intended to cause\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## B. Clear Attribution and Defense Guidelines\nAttribution is deemed to be the most challenging aspect of cyberattacks.¹⁸⁸ The Cyber Treaty must establish elements needed to attribute a cyberattack to the wrongdoing state. Along with the elements of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should outline the evidence a state must present to prove attribution. Evidence may include IP addresses, information from political sources, similarities to malware with known actors, the temporal proximity of similar cyberattacks, and using a “honeypot” to identify actors.¹⁸⁹ With these guidelines in place, states should no longer be able to shift responsibility to groups or individuals hired to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹⁰\nMoreover, attribution is crucial for a state’s legitimate claim of self-defense.¹⁹¹ Accordingly, the Cyber Treaty should outline how a state may defend itself in a cyberattack. It is important to clarify what kind of attack a state may retaliate with, whether purely cyber or a mixed attack. These guidelines should still be in accordance with the international principles of necessity and proportionality discussed previously.\n## C. Inclusion of Non-State Actors\nAlong the same lines of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should encompass the actions of non-state actors as cyberattacks. The laws of war do not apply to non-state actors, which is problematic when states employ groups or individuals to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹² It is hypothesized that non-state actors could violate the laws of war if a “clear relationship” exists with a state.\n---\n¹⁸⁸. See Simmons, supra note 13, at 100.\n¹⁸⁹. See Nguyen, supra note 93, at 1105.\n¹⁹⁰. See discussion supra Section III.A.\n¹⁹¹. See Moore, supra note 21, at 242.\n¹⁹². See discussion supra Section II.B.3.\nStetson Business Law Review\n[Vol. 4.1]\n\nInstead, the Cyber Treaty should focus on state responsibility for the actions of non-state actors. First and foremost, a cyberattack must be considered state conduct if a state sponsors a cyberattack. More importantly, states should be held responsible for the acts of non-actors, especially when states knowingly allow\"its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"¹⁹⁵ Such a rule would hold states like Russia responsible for the acts of Russian hackers that carry out thousands of cyberattacks.¹⁹⁶ This framework would also remove the ability of states to claim plausible deniability for the actions of others because any cyberattack carried out within a state's territory would be the state's responsibility. Going further, even if there is no state involvement, the state should still be held responsible for not taking the appropriate measures to stop the attacks.\n## D. Possibility of an International Cyber Treaty While the idea of a Cyber Treaty is conceptually solid, many forces make its adoption uncertain in the real world. International politics and conflicting state interests play a vital role in the making and passing of international law.¹⁹⁷ A viable Cyber Treaty will require states with different views on cyberattacks to come together and agree on its terms.¹⁹⁸ Although not all UN member\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## 1. Conflicting State Interests\nThe key players in the Cyber Treaty are Russia, China, and the U.S. Each state has different cyber goals. For example, Russia focuses on cyber policies that support state sovereignty and the ability to keep citizen loyalties in check.¹⁹⁹ China has similar goals as Russia and emphasizes the importance of preemptive cyberattacks.²⁰⁰ Meanwhile, the U.S. is focused on cooperation between international law enforcement agencies to stop cyberattacks and apprehend cybercriminals.²⁰¹ Despite multiple efforts by the Russian government²⁰² to reach an agreement on cyber matters with the U.S., the U.S. remains apprehensive about Russia's intentions, and with good reason.²⁰³ Although the U.S. and Russia have not agreed on most cyber issues, in 2015, Russia and China entered into a bilateral cyber treaty that pledges neither state will launch a cyberattack against the other.²⁰⁴ While this treaty only binds Russia and China, it marks a first step toward an International Cyber Treaty. I do not believe the conflicting state interests between China, Russia, and the United States will render a Cyber Treaty impossible. States should set\n¹⁹⁹. See Timothy L.

Moving Past the Politics\nRussia and the U.S. had even more significant ideological differences during the Cold War.²⁰⁶ Though cyberattacks cause catastrophic effects on the economy, infrastructure, supply chains, and more,²⁰⁷ the severity of the Cold War cannot be compared. The Cold War was not just a space race but also a nuclear arms race between the U.S. and Russia.²⁰⁸ These two nations were actively developing weapons of mass destruction and threatening each other with nuclear attacks.²⁰⁹ However, during the height of the Cold War, important agreements were reached, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere) and the Outer Space Treaty (outlawing weapons of mass destruction in outer space).²¹⁰ If the U.S. and Russia reached agreements during such tense and terrifying times, it should be possible to do the same in today's world. An International Cyber Treaty that provides rules and guidance on cyberattacks would benefit both countries and promote stability in the \"fifth battlespace.\"²¹¹\n## E. UN Expert Groups\nIn its capacity, the U.N. has attempted to address the complex issues of cyberspace and international law. The U.N. has\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nWhile these groups are important in developing norms and guidelines for cyber matters, the drawback of the groups is in their non-binding nature. Though some nations, namely Russia, that are part of these groups work with other experts to develop these guidelines, it is clear the rules are not being followed by the member-states. While the reports serve as important guiding principles all states should follow, the reality is they are not being properly adhered to. This is another reason why a Cyber Treaty is needed. There is only so much that non-binding norms and U.N. resolutions will do in getting states to cooperate with proper cyber behavior.\n\nThe above-mentioned group of experts (“Experts”) on this matter consists of twenty-five members from different U.N. member countries. Some of the countries participating in this group include the United States, Estonia, China, and notably, Russia.\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] In its latest July 2021 Report, the Experts built on their recommendations of the 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports which laid out eleven non-binding norms of state behavior in the context of international security.²¹⁸ Some of the norms outlined include states not knowingly allowing their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs, states taking appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from ICT threats, and states should not knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams.²¹⁹ These norms are further analyzed in the expert’s 2021 report on this matter, including examples of “the kinds of institutional arrangements that States can put in place at the national and regional levels to support their implementation.”²²⁰ For example, regarding the norm that states should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for wrongful acts using ICTs, the experts propose that “[a] State that is aware of but lacks the capacity to address internationally wrongful acts conducted using ICTs in its territory may consider seeking assistance from other States or the private sector in a manner consistent with international and domestic law.”²²¹ This norm is especially important in aiding developing countries that may not have adequate capacity to deal with these complex matters.\n\nAnother group that is currently working on cyber and information security matters is the above-stated open-ended working group (“Group”).²²² This Group convened for its fifth substantive session from July 24-28, 2023. At its eightieth session, the group will submit a final report to the General Assembly.²²³ In its first annual 2022 progress report, the Group noted that cyber cooperation and assistance between states “could be strengthened to ensure the integrity of the supply chain and\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## VI. CONCLUSION\nThis Comment focused on the application of the laws of war to cyberattacks. While there is no question the laws of war codified in the UN Charter apply to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient in practice. Issues arise due to the nature of cyberattacks and the traditional definitions of \"force\" and \"armed attack.\" Moreover, there is difficulty in applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks due to proper state attribution and the exclusion of non-state actors. These challenges can be addressed by a Cyber Treaty negotiated by the three key players: the U.S., China, and Russia. Although the cyber interests and goals of the U.S. are different from those of Russia and China, the differences should not render a Cyber Treaty impossible. Much like during the Cold War with the passing of the Outer Space Treaty, the first step is to put politics behind and realize creating a Cyber Treaty could benefit all.\n²²⁴. Id.\n²²⁵.

INTRODUCTION\nApproximately ninety-two cyberattacks will occur during the time it takes to read this article. A University of Maryland study found that, on average, there is one cyberattack every thirty-nine seconds around the world.² This haunting statistic puts into perspective the magnitude of international cybercrime. It explains why 156 nations, including the United States, Russia, China, and Iran, have taken measures to combat the ever-increasing problem of cybercrime.³ What happens, however, when nations perpetuate cybercrime against other nations? These so-called cross-border, aggressive, state-sponsored cyberattacks are an increasing international problem. Since 2005, there have been at least 247 cyberattacks sponsored by China, 174 by Russia, 97 by Iran, and\n1.

It is apparent that the laws of the United Nations' (\"UN\") Charter are insufficient to address cyberattacks. The international arena must devote its efforts to working on an International Cyber Treaty (\"Cyber Treaty\") that addresses state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Cyber Treaty should clarify conflicting standards and fill gaps in current international law. This comment examines the feasibility of the Cyber Treaty considering the key players' conflicting interests.\nPart II addresses the *jus ad bellum* principles of international law: UN Charter Articles 2(4) and 51 and their applicability to cyber-attacks. Part III examines the Russian-sponsored 2007 Estonia Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\") Attack and its applicability to the laws of war. Part IV highlights the intersection between cybersecurity and outer space, including the increasing concern for satellite cyberattacks.

The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations10 (“Tallinn Manual” or “Manual”) defines *jus ad bellum* as “international law governing a State’s resort to force as an instrument of its national policy.”11 Plainly stated, this principle lays out the circumstances under which states could permissibly go to war. The core of *jus ad bellum* lies in the general prohibition against states using force on one another, found in Article 2(4), coupled with two exceptions in Articles 39 and 51. Working together with *jus ad bellum* is the international law principle of *jus in bello*, which governs a state’s conduct once already engaged in war.12 Applying *jus in bello* to cyberattacks is also a complex discussion topic that has earned scholars’ attention. This comment, however, focuses on applying *jus ad bellum* only to cyberattacks.\n## 1.

Before diving into the different interpretations of the word \"force,\" it is helpful to understand the historical events that led to the adoption of Article 2(4). The core of Article 2(4) traces back to the end of World War I when the League of Nations declared that \"any war or threat of war\" was of concern to the world.15 The development of Article 2(4) continued with the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which condemned states resorting to war and ended in 1945 with the formal signing of the UN Charter, formally establishing the UN and articulating Article 2(4).16 The events leading up to the formal recitation of Article 2(4) include the two World Wars, which along with the UN's aim \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\"17 suggests a focus on the use of force by way of military instruments.18 This determination also paves the way for the dominant view that Article 2(4) prohibits physical armed force only, as opposed to, for example, force as coercion.19\nIt is generally accepted and historically understood that force under Article 2(4) requires \"armed force.\"20 In support of this view, the UN Charter's preamble states that \"armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.\"21 In addition, Article 51\n13.

Exceptions to Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force\nArticle 2(4)'s prohibition on the use of force is subject to two exceptions: force may be allowed if the UN Security Council determines such force is needed to restore the peace²⁴ and if a state is acting in self-defense.²⁵ Article 51 codifies the latter exception providing that:\n[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.²⁶\nThe UN left the term \"armed attack\" undefined, which leads to competing interpretations of the term's intended meaning.²⁷ What is clear from Article 51 is that the right of self-defense is based on principles of necessity and proportionality.²⁸ A state's use of force under Article 2(4) might be legitimate under Article 51 only if there was an armed attack before the claim of self-defense, meaning Article 51 does not protect preemptive state attacks.²⁹\n## B.

In fact, the International Court of Justice declared that Articles 2(4) and 51 “appl[y] to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed” in their analysis of whether the use of nuclear weapons constituted force.⁴¹ As such, the inquiry is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies to cyberattacks but *how* to successfully apply these traditional law principles to this non-traditional weapon. The difficulty of applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks lies in the attacks’ nature.⁴² Cyberattacks are virtual, complex, anonymous, and can cause catastrophic injury to millions, potentially billions, of people, with some simple lines of code.⁴³ The unique features of cyberattacks pose difficulties when applying the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack,” leading to the conclusion that the current laws of war may be insufficient to confront this problem.⁴⁴\n1.  Threat or Use of Force Revisited\nConcerning force under Article 2(4), the primary consideration is whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force required under the traditional definition. There are six helpful factors to determine whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force.⁴⁵ These factors are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness,\nand-international-law-in-the-21st-century); Kersti Kaljulaid, Former President of the Republic of Estonia, Remarks at the Opening of CyCon 2019 (May 29, 2019) (stating “[w]e believe and state that both the rights and obligations of international law, including those stated in the U.N.

On the other hand, a cyberattack on a university network designed to disrupt military research on campus would not rise to the level of armed force under these factors.⁴⁸ The low severity of the university attack, coupled with minimal consequences, fails to “resemble that characteristic of uses of armed force.”⁴⁹\n## 2. Exceptions to the Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Revisited\nLikewise, Article 51 also begs the question of whether a cyberattack rises to the level of an armed attack required for a state to enjoy the right of self-defense. Article 51 is seemingly narrower than Article 2(4), meaning that not all uses of force qualify as armed attacks.⁵⁰ There are three factors to consider whether a cyberattack constitutes an “armed attack.”⁵¹ These factors include the consequences of the attack, the state’s consideration of aggressive intent, and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack.⁵² Consistent with the meaning of armed force under Article 2(4), the consequences of an armed attack must rise to a certain level in severity for a state to be justified in using self-defense.⁵³ Using these factors, a severe DDoS attack against the United States that cripples infrastructure would be considered armed force due to the severity.⁵⁴ In this scenario, the United States can respond with an armed force to defend itself, granted it abides by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and the attack can be attributed to a state actor.⁵⁵ A state’s right to use\n46.

Id.\nStetson Business Law Review\n[Vol. 4.1]\narmed force after a cyberattack raises the question of what type of force it may use to defend itself, which this Comment addresses in the proceeding Section.\n## 3. Application of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks is Insufficient\nWhile it is possible to apply *jus ad bellum* to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient to regulate cyberattacks due to the traditional interpretation of the laws. One of the most significant difficulties in applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks is that the traditional definition of “armed force” focuses on force carried out physically and having a physical effect, such as a conventional bomb.⁵⁶ This interpretation would be too narrow for cyberattacks, considering the non-physical nature of cyberattacks. Although a cyberattack may trigger a physical reaction, much of the concern regarding cyberattacks surrounds a state’s loss or destruction of data.⁵⁷ Second, even using the more expansive definitions of *force* that focus on the attack’s consequences presented by Schmitt and the Tallinn Manual, the threshold for these factors is unclear. For example, the Estonia DDoS attack⁵⁸ merely caused confusion and unrest, even though the attack was on Estonia’s infrastructure.⁵⁹ Under Schmitt’s and the Manual’s framework, would the Estonia cyberattack rise to the level of armed force, even though its consequences were minimal and trivial?⁶⁰ The answer is unclear, considering the ambiguous definitions and traditional understanding of “armed force.” Even using broad interpretations of “force,” many ambiguities surround applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks.\nApplying Article 51 to cyberattacks is also problematic due to the issue of attribution. Attribution is a crucial step to claims of self-defense under Article 51.⁶¹ A state must know the perpetrator’s identity to retaliate under Article 51.⁶² Cyberattacks are distinguishable from conventional attacks because there are no soldiers, physical presence, or weapons to determine the\n56.

Id.\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n179\nattacker.⁶³ In fact, perpetrators of cyberattacks actively disguise their identities by altering IP addresses.⁶⁴ Even more dangerous is that a state may launch a cyberattack under the guise of originating from another state, effectively masking its identity and potentially instigating a retaliatory armed attack against the wrong state.⁶⁵ A state should not utilize Article 51's right to self-defense if it cannot determine where the cyberattack originated. However, what if a state believes it knows which state launched the attack? Under the current laws of war, nothing prevents a state from using the right of self-defense in this scenario.⁶⁶ It is unclear if a state would be justified in launching a retaliatory armed attack if it was mistaken as to the attacker's identity.\nAlong these lines of retaliation, the type of force a state may use in retaliation is also ambiguous. Using the example of the severe DDoS attack against the U.S., the question is: Provided the U.S. knows which state perpetuated the attack, could the U.S. launch its own attack against the state and cripple that state's infrastructure? The U.S. would be bound to retaliate using another \"pure cyberattack\" (meaning no physical effect), considering the principles of necessity and proportionality.⁶⁷ However, what if, for some reason, a \"pure cyberattack\" was not a viable option for the U.S.? Could the U.S. respond with physical force, or must it forego its right of self-defense? Once again, the current laws of war do not answer this question.\nAnother problematic element of the laws of war is that non-state actors cannot violate Article 2(4) because it applies only to state actors.⁶⁸ It is common practice for governments to contract individuals or groups of hackers to attack states.⁶⁹ If a non-state actor carries out a cyberattack, the attacked state cannot enjoy the right of self-defense under Article 51. In addition, under the current principles of jus ad bellum, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda may launch cyberattacks against states with (in theory) no retaliation since al-Qaeda is not a state actor.

CROSS-BORDER AGGRESSIVE CYBERATTACKS BETWEEN STATE ACTORS\n### A. Estonia DDoS Attack\nIn 2007, Estonia became the first victim of a cyberattack sponsored by a state actor.70 The cyberattacks were in response to the Estonian government's choice to relocate a Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn.71 The type of attack utilized was the Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\"), one of the most commonly used cyberattacks.72 DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a site with fake requests to the point that the site cannot respond to all requests, and subsequently, the site crashes.73 The DDoS attacks targeted the Estonian \"government and parliamentary portals, ministries, news outlets, internet service providers, major banks, and small businesses.\"74 These attacks profoundly affected Estonia's infrastructure due to the state's heavy reliance on the Internet.75 This tiny nation, dubbed e-Estonia, is at the forefront of e-democracy76 and is recognized as the world's most advanced digital society.77 The sites of the two biggest Estonian banks were offline for about forty-five to ninety minutes, blocking access to simple financial tasks such as accessing or transferring money.78 Also, the\n70.

However, there is information available to suggest that Russia could have been at least indirectly responsible for the attacks.⁸⁰ Evidence of Russian responsibility included IP addresses tracing back to the computers of Russian government agencies, the Russian government's refusal to assist the Estonian government in resolving the attacks,⁸¹ and DDoS online attack instructions written in Russian.⁸² Furthermore, Russia severed commercially important railways with no prior notice for alleged repairs during the attacks.⁸³ While the Russian government completely denies responsibility,⁸⁴ the overwhelming evidence points to some Russian government orchestration, especially considering the funding needed for such attacks.⁸⁵ However, since no \"smoking gun\" proves Russian government involvement, it is difficult to attribute the attack to Russia properly. There was, however, one conviction in connection with the cyberattacks. Dmitri Galuškevits, an Estonian student of Russian origin, was convicted for targeting a political party's website.⁸⁶ The size of the operation suggests many others were responsible for the attacks, however, due to Russia's non-cooperation, the rest remain without any repercussions.⁸⁷\n1.

Michael Schmitt applies his “use of force” framework and concludes that the Estonian cyberattacks rose to the level of “armed force.”88 Schmitt cites the severe consequences of the attack, such as the disruption of government function and services, economic turmoil, and adverse effects on the Estonian people.89 Likewise, Schmitt reasons the attacks were immediate, direct, invasive, and presumably illegitimate.90 Schmitt concedes there is difficulty quantifying the consequences of the cyberattack as the only factor opposing the conclusion. Balancing all the elements, Schmitt concludes, “the incident arguably reached the use-of-force threshold.”91\nInterestingly, Reese Nguyen comes to the opposite conclusion using this same framework on the Estonian cyberattacks.92 Nguyen claims (1) the cyberattacks were not that severe due to lack of injury and destruction; (2) the consequences were delayed; (3) the effects were not directly tied to the DDoS attacks; (4) there was minimal invasion due to the remote execution of the cyberattacks; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify; and (6) since the attacks were legitimate because they were limited to telecommunication systems.93 Using the same (widely accepted94) framework to determine whether a cyberattack amounts to the “use of force” and reaching contradictory conclusions exposes the inadequacy of applying jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the contradictory framework of Article 2(4), applying Article 51 to the Estonian cyberattacks would also be problematic. Since the cyberattacks were not adequately attributed to Russia, Estonia could not use the right of self-defense outlined in Article 51. Even more problematic is that the cyberattacks against Estonia were carried out by non-state actors, meaning Articles 2(4) and 51 would not apply to them.\n88. Michael N.

NATO Article 5\nAnother aspect of this cyberattack is the implication of NATO Article 5,⁹⁵ which would evoke a collective defensive response against Russia from NATO members.⁹⁶ Some experts speculate that the Russian government purposefully fell short of the threshold for invoking Article 5 due to the severe repercussions it may face from NATO's collective defense.⁹⁷ While Article 5 was not invoked in the Estonia cyberattacks, it is clear that NATO will defend its allies against a cyberattack.⁹⁸ Article 5 serves as another layer of defense for NATO countries against serious cyberattacks, a resource that should be used more often.\n## B. Cyberattacks Between Russia and Ukraine\nWhile there is a physical war between Russian and Ukraine,⁹⁹ the battle is also occurring in cyberspace.

Applying Article 51’s use of self-defense might not be problematic in this instance because the cyberattacks against Ukraine have already been attributed to Russia, and it is clear any further cyberattacks will also be attributed to the Russian government. The familiar problem would be applying Article 2(4). The definition of “armed force” is extremely limited and traditionally includes only physical force and effects. However, considering more modern interpretations of “armed force,” an argument could be made that the consequences of Russia’s cyberattack are not minimal. If Russia plans to ramp up its cyberwarfare, Russia may be successful at shutting down Ukraine’s electric grid as it has tried in the past. As mentioned before, the ambiguity of what constitutes “armed force” makes it difficult to apply this law. However, an attack of this magnitude may be enough to trigger Article 2(4), regardless of any physical destruction.\n¹¹⁵. Brumfield, supra note 109.\n¹¹⁶.

Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin added thousands of satellites to the Earth's low orbit.¹⁵⁴ For example, SpaceX plans to send over 40,000 Starlink satellites into space to provide low-cost Internet to remote areas worldwide.¹⁵⁵ With more plans to launch satellites from SpaceX and other companies, comes more demand for building satellites cheaper and faster.¹⁵⁶ The rapid building of satellites is of increasing interest¹⁵⁷ due to the possibility of companies cutting corners to decrease costs and speed up production.¹⁵⁸ The commercial space industry boom has opened the door for more cyberattacks. There are more non-government space actors than ever, and the highly technical aspect of building satellites allows multiple manufacturers to be involved in a single satellite.¹⁵⁹ These new realities create new targets along an extensive supply chain that companies and governments are not currently equipped to handle.\n151.

Viasat KA-SAT Satellite Cyberattack\nOne example of the consequences a cyberattack may have on a satellite comes via the Viasat KA-SAT case. On February 24, 2022, the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a cyberattack was launched against Viasat's KA-SAT satellite broadband service.¹⁶⁰ The cyberattack impacted the internet access of tens of thousands of Ukrainian and EU citizens and severed the remote monitoring access of 5,800 wind turbines of a German energy company.¹⁶¹ The malware used to carry out the attacks is called \"AcidRain,\" designed to remotely \"wipe modems and routers.\"¹⁶² The AcidRain malware bears coding similarities with another malware previously attributed to Russia's Sandworm group.¹⁶³ This piece of evidence, along with the suspicious timing of the cyberattack, leads many to conclude Russia sponsored the cyberattack.¹⁶⁴ The U.S. formally attributed the satellite cyberattack to Russia in a press statement by the Secretary of State.¹⁶⁵ While the U.S., E.U., and other countries condemned the cyberattacks, there was no discussion of its applicability to Articles 2(4) and 51, nor NATO Article 5 repercussions.¹⁶⁶ Such inaction to punish Russia continues to set a dangerous precedent of allowing state-sponsored malicious cyberattacks.\n¹⁶⁰.

An International Cyber Treaty needs to be negotiated by the key players to codify cyber rules that benefit all, much like was done in 1967 with the Outer Space Treaty.\n## V. INTERNATIONAL CYBER TREATY\nThough it may be difficult to envision a Cyber Treaty that addresses the issues outlined in this Comment, European countries agreed to a comprehensive international cybercrime treaty in 2001.¹⁸⁰ The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”), among many other things, defines criminal offenses for cybercrime and establishes domestic procedures for prosecuting computer crimes.¹⁸¹ Moreover, the UN is working on another major Cybercrime Convention to deal with topics like international cooperation on cybercrime, law\n176.

Why is there no international treaty on cross-border cyberattacks sponsored by state actors? The answer is embedded in politics and conflicting state interests.\n## A. Defining Cyberattack\nThe first step to drafting a successful International Cyber Treaty will be defining a cyberattack. Without a cohesive, agreed-upon definition of cyberattack, it is challenging to differentiate cyberattacks from cybercrime and cyberespionage.¹⁸³ The definition of cyberattack should be specific and concise, leaving no room for interpretation. Making the definition of a cyberattack too broad may open the door for differing interpretations and further disagreements.¹⁸⁴\nWhile the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyberattack is a good starting point, its effect-based approach is problematic for several reasons.¹⁸⁵ First, the definition focuses on the cyberattack causing injury, death, or destruction to objects. Most cyberattacks do not cause such effects but rather result in, among other things, data loss and server disruption.¹⁸⁶ For example, the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused financial losses and general inconvenience to the public, but there was no injury, death, or destruction to objects.¹⁸⁷ Another issue with the Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattack is that it does not address the intent to cause injury, death, or destruction to objects. For instance, consider a Russian-sponsored cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, hoping to destroy it. If, for some reason, the cyberattack is not accomplished, it would not be deemed a \"cyberattack\" under the Tallinn Manual. A state actor should be held accountable for failed or uncompleted cyberattacks because the state intended to cause\n182. United Nations Cybercrime Treaty, ELEC.

The definition of cyberattack should include an intent element to deal with these situations. More importantly, the definition of cyberattack should be broad enough to capture the different ways a cyberattack can be carried out but also specific enough not to leave room for differing interpretations.\n## B. Clear Attribution and Defense Guidelines\nAttribution is deemed to be the most challenging aspect of cyberattacks.¹⁸⁸ The Cyber Treaty must establish elements needed to attribute a cyberattack to the wrongdoing state. Along with the elements of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should outline the evidence a state must present to prove attribution. Evidence may include IP addresses, information from political sources, similarities to malware with known actors, the temporal proximity of similar cyberattacks, and using a “honeypot” to identify actors.¹⁸⁹ With these guidelines in place, states should no longer be able to shift responsibility to groups or individuals hired to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹⁰\nMoreover, attribution is crucial for a state’s legitimate claim of self-defense.¹⁹¹ Accordingly, the Cyber Treaty should outline how a state may defend itself in a cyberattack. It is important to clarify what kind of attack a state may retaliate with, whether purely cyber or a mixed attack. These guidelines should still be in accordance with the international principles of necessity and proportionality discussed previously.\n## C. Inclusion of Non-State Actors\nAlong the same lines of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should encompass the actions of non-state actors as cyberattacks. The laws of war do not apply to non-state actors, which is problematic when states employ groups or individuals to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹² It is hypothesized that non-state actors could violate the laws of war if a “clear relationship” exists with a state.\n---\n¹⁸⁸. See Simmons, supra note 13, at 100.\n¹⁸⁹. See Nguyen, supra note 93, at 1105.\n¹⁹⁰. See discussion supra Section III.A.\n¹⁹¹. See Moore, supra note 21, at 242.\n¹⁹². See discussion supra Section II.B.3.\nStetson Business Law Review\n[Vol. 4.1]\n193 However, it is unclear what constitutes a clear relationship. Using the 2007 Estonia DDoS cyberattacks as an example, there is definitive proof of Russian government involvement, but is this enough to form a \"clear relationship\"? The Russian government certainly does not think so,¹⁹⁴ which is why this framework is not very useful.\nInstead, the Cyber Treaty should focus on state responsibility for the actions of non-state actors. First and foremost, a cyberattack must be considered state conduct if a state sponsors a cyberattack. More importantly, states should be held responsible for the acts of non-actors, especially when states knowingly allow \"its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"¹⁹⁵ Such a rule would hold states like Russia responsible for the acts of Russian hackers that carry out thousands of cyberattacks.¹⁹⁶ This framework would also remove the ability of states to claim plausible deniability for the actions of others because any cyberattack carried out within a state's territory would be the state's responsibility. Going further, even if there is no state involvement, the state should still be held responsible for not taking the appropriate measures to stop the attacks.\n## D. Possibility of an International Cyber Treaty\nWhile the idea of a Cyber Treaty is conceptually solid, many forces make its adoption uncertain in the real world. International politics and conflicting state interests play a vital role in the making and passing of international law.¹⁹⁷ A viable Cyber Treaty will require states with different views on cyberattacks to come together and agree on its terms.¹⁹⁸ Although not all UN member\n193.

Conflicting State Interests\nThe key players in the Cyber Treaty are Russia, China, and the U.S. Each state has different cyber goals. For example, Russia focuses on cyber policies that support state sovereignty and the ability to keep citizen loyalties in check.¹⁹⁹ China has similar goals as Russia and emphasizes the importance of preemptive cyberattacks.²⁰⁰ Meanwhile, the U.S. is focused on cooperation between international law enforcement agencies to stop cyberattacks and apprehend cybercriminals.²⁰¹ Despite multiple efforts by the Russian government²⁰² to reach an agreement on cyber matters with the U.S., the U.S. remains apprehensive about Russia's intentions, and with good reason.²⁰³ Although the U.S. and Russia have not agreed on most cyber issues, in 2015, Russia and China entered into a bilateral cyber treaty that pledges neither state will launch a cyberattack against the other.²⁰⁴ While this treaty only binds Russia and China, it marks a first step toward an International Cyber Treaty. I do not believe the conflicting state interests between China, Russia, and the United States will render a Cyber Treaty impossible. States should set\n¹⁹⁹. See Timothy L.

Moving Past the Politics\nRussia and the U.S. had even more significant ideological differences during the Cold War.²⁰⁶ Though cyberattacks cause catastrophic effects on the economy, infrastructure, supply chains, and more,²⁰⁷ the severity of the Cold War cannot be compared. The Cold War was not just a space race but also a nuclear arms race between the U.S. and Russia.²⁰⁸ These two nations were actively developing weapons of mass destruction and threatening each other with nuclear attacks.²⁰⁹ However, during the height of the Cold War, important agreements were reached, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere) and the Outer Space Treaty (outlawing weapons of mass destruction in outer space).²¹⁰ If the U.S. and Russia reached agreements during such tense and terrifying times, it should be possible to do the same in today's world.

The groups of note are the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security²¹⁴ and the “Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies.”²¹⁵ These groups were mandated by the U.N., among other things, to “further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States,”²¹⁶ and promote “an open, secure, stable and accessible ICT [information and communications technologies] environment.”²¹⁷\nWhile these groups are important in developing norms and guidelines for cyber matters, the drawback of the groups is in their non-binding nature. Though some nations, namely Russia, that are part of these groups work with other experts to develop these guidelines, it is clear the rules are not being followed by the member-states. While the reports serve as important guiding principles all states should follow, the reality is they are not being properly adhered to. This is another reason why a Cyber Treaty is needed. There is only so much that non-binding norms and U.N. resolutions will do in getting states to cooperate with proper cyber behavior.\n1. UN G.G.E.\nThe above-mentioned group of experts (“Experts”) on this matter consists of twenty-five members from different U.N. member countries. Some of the countries participating in this group include the United States, Estonia, China, and notably, Russia.\n212.

In the coming years, this Group should further develop norms and rules for existing and potential cyber threats that are persuasive enough for states to follow.\n## VI. CONCLUSION\nThis Comment focused on the application of the laws of war to cyberattacks. While there is no question the laws of war codified in the UN Charter apply to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient in practice. Issues arise due to the nature of cyberattacks and the traditional definitions of \"force\" and \"armed attack.\" Moreover, there is difficulty in applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks due to proper state attribution and the exclusion of non-state actors. These challenges can be addressed by a Cyber Treaty negotiated by the three key players: the U.S., China, and Russia. Although the cyber interests and goals of the U.S. are different from those of Russia and China, the differences should not render a Cyber Treaty impossible. Much like during the Cold War with the passing of the Outer Space Treaty, the first step is to put politics behind and realize creating a Cyber Treaty could benefit all.\n²²⁴. Id.\n²²⁵.

INTRODUCTION Approximately ninety-two cyberattacks will occur during the time it takes to read this article. A University of Maryland study found that, on average, there is one cyberattack every thirty-nine seconds around the world.² This haunting statistic puts into perspective the magnitude of international cybercrime. It explains why 156 nations, including the United States, Russia, China, and Iran, have taken measures to combat the ever-increasing problem of cybercrime.³ What happens, however, when nations perpetuate cybercrime against other nations? These so-called cross-border, aggressive, state-sponsored cyberattacks are an increasing international problem. Since 2005, there have been at least 247 cyberattacks sponsored by China, 174 by Russia, 97 by Iran, and\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nThis comment examines the applicability of current international laws of war to cross-border attacks sponsored by state actors. It is apparent that the laws of the United Nations' (\"UN\") Charter are insufficient to address cyberattacks. The international arena must devote its efforts to working on an International Cyber Treaty (\"Cyber Treaty\") that addresses state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Cyber Treaty should clarify conflicting standards and fill gaps in current international law. This comment examines the feasibility of the Cyber Treaty considering the key players' conflicting interests.\nPart II addresses the *jus ad bellum* principles of international law: UN Charter Articles 2(4) and 51 and their applicability to cyber-attacks. Part III examines the Russian-sponsored 2007 Estonia Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\") Attack and its applicability to the laws of war. Part IV highlights the intersection between cybersecurity and outer space, including the increasing concern for satellite cyberattacks. Moreover, this Part discusses the differences and similarities between the legal instruments of space law and cyber law. Part V proposes an International Cyber Treaty that fills in the gaps left by applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## II. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ATTACKS ### A. Applicable International Law The UN is the most influential international organization that creates and codifies international law.⁶ The UN Charter contains Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] many significant laws, including Article 2(4),7 arguably one of the most important rules of modern international law.8 Articles 2(4) and (51)9 of the UN Charter codify the international law concept of *jus ad bellum*, which is the international law governing states going to war (“laws of war”). The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations10 (“Tallinn Manual” or “Manual”) defines *jus ad bellum* as “international law governing a State’s resort to force as an instrument of its national policy.”11 Plainly stated, this principle lays out the circumstances under which states could permissibly go to war. The core of *jus ad bellum* lies in the general prohibition against states using force on one another, found in Article 2(4), coupled with two exceptions in Articles 39 and 51. Working together with *jus ad bellum* is the international law principle of *jus in bello*, which governs a state’s conduct once already engaged in war.12 Applying *jus in bello* to cyberattacks is also a complex discussion topic that has earned scholars’ attention. This comment, however, focuses on applying *jus ad bellum* only to cyberattacks.\n## 1. Threat or Use of Force Article 2(4) of the UN Charter declares that: All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or in developing nations). But see Julia Zorthian, *5 United Nations Achievements Worth Celebrating on U.N. Day*, TIME (Oct. 23, 2015, 6:20PM), https://time.com/4085757/united-nations-achievements/. (listing major UN accomplishments including pyramid preservation, smallpox eradication, and arms control promotion).\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nThe age-old question is: What did the UN mean by\"force\"?14 The answer is, of course, it depends. Before diving into the different interpretations of the word\"force,\"it is helpful to understand the historical events that led to the adoption of Article 2(4). The core of Article 2(4) traces back to the end of World War I when the League of Nations declared that\"any war or threat of war\"was of concern to the world.15 The development of Article 2(4) continued with the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which condemned states resorting to war and ended in 1945 with the formal signing of the UN Charter, formally establishing the UN and articulating Article 2(4).16 The events leading up to the formal recitation of Article 2(4) include the two World Wars, which along with the UN's aim\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\"17 suggests a focus on the use of force by way of military instruments.18 This determination also paves the way for the dominant view that Article 2(4) prohibits physical armed force only, as opposed to, for example, force as coercion.19 It is generally accepted and historically understood that force under Article 2(4) requires\"armed force.\"20 In support of this view, the UN Charter's preamble states that\"armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.\"21 In addition, Article 51 Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] (discussed below) references self-defense against armed attacks.²² The problem with this strict interpretation is that only instances of military violence would violate Article 2(4), and states may only exercise the right of self-defense under Article 51 from armed military violence of another state.²³ ## 2. Exceptions to Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the use of force is subject to two exceptions: force may be allowed if the UN Security Council determines such force is needed to restore the peace²⁴ and if a state is acting in self-defense.²⁵ Article 51 codifies the latter exception providing that: [n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.²⁶ The UN left the term\"armed attack\"undefined, which leads to competing interpretations of the term's intended meaning.²⁷ What is clear from Article 51 is that the right of self-defense is based on principles of necessity and proportionality.²⁸ A state's use of force under Article 2(4) might be legitimate under Article 51 only if there was an armed attack before the claim of self-defense, meaning Article 51 does not protect preemptive state attacks.²⁹ ## B. Applicability and Sufficiency of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks Before applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks, it is necessary first to define a cyberattack. Starting with what a cyberattack is not, a cyberattack is not the same thing as\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nRegarding the application of Articles 2(4) and 51, there is increasing agreement among states and scholars that these rules apply to cyberattacks.³⁷ States in agreement include the United States, the United Kingdom, and Estonia.³⁸ The Tallinn Manual Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] also supports this conclusion: “[b]oth International Groups of Experts were unanimous in their estimation that existing international law applies to cyber operations.”³⁹ Difficulties arise when applying the laws of war to cyberattacks due to the traditional language of the Articles.⁴⁰ It is through no fault of their own, however, that the UN’s founders did not foresee the current modern digital world and the possibility of cyberattacks before the signing of the UN Charter in 1945. In fact, the International Court of Justice declared that Articles 2(4) and 51 “appl[y] to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed” in their analysis of whether the use of nuclear weapons constituted force.⁴¹ As such, the inquiry is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies to cyberattacks but *how* to successfully apply these traditional law principles to this non-traditional weapon. The difficulty of applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks lies in the attacks’ nature.⁴² Cyberattacks are virtual, complex, anonymous, and can cause catastrophic injury to millions, potentially billions, of people, with some simple lines of code.⁴³ The unique features of cyberattacks pose difficulties when applying the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack,” leading to the conclusion that the current laws of war may be insufficient to confront this problem.⁴⁴ Concerning force under Article 2(4), the primary consideration is whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force required under the traditional definition. There are six helpful factors to determine whether a cyberattack rises to the level of armed force.⁴⁵ These factors are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and-international-law-in-the-21st-century); Kersti Kaljulaid, Former President of the Republic of Estonia, Remarks at the Opening of CyCon 2019 (May 29, 2019) (stating “[w]e believe and state that both the rights and obligations of international law, including those stated in the U.N. Charter, do apply to states when using IT and communication technologies”).\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## 2. Exceptions to the Prohibition on Threat or Use of Force Revisited\nLikewise, Article 51 also begs the question of whether a cyberattack rises to the level of an armed attack required for a state to enjoy the right of self-defense. Article 51 is seemingly narrower than Article 2(4), meaning that not all uses of force qualify as armed attacks.⁵⁰ There are three factors to consider whether a cyberattack constitutes an “armed attack.”⁵¹ These factors include the consequences of the attack, the state’s consideration of aggressive intent, and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack.⁵² Consistent with the meaning of armed force under Article 2(4), the consequences of an armed attack must rise to a certain level in severity for a state to be justified in using self-defense.⁵³ Using these factors, a severe DDoS attack against the United States that cripples infrastructure would be considered armed force due to the severity.⁵⁴ In this scenario, the United States can respond with an armed force to defend itself, granted it abides by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and the attack can be attributed to a state actor.⁵⁵ A state’s right to use\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] armed force after a cyberattack raises the question of what type of force it may use to defend itself, which this Comment addresses in the proceeding Section.\n## 3. Application of Jus Ad Bellum to Cyberattacks is Insufficient While it is possible to apply *jus ad bellum* to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient to regulate cyberattacks due to the traditional interpretation of the laws. One of the most significant difficulties in applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks is that the traditional definition of “armed force” focuses on force carried out physically and having a physical effect, such as a conventional bomb.⁵⁶ This interpretation would be too narrow for cyberattacks, considering the non-physical nature of cyberattacks. Although a cyberattack may trigger a physical reaction, much of the concern regarding cyberattacks surrounds a state’s loss or destruction of data.⁵⁷ Second, even using the more expansive definitions of *force* that focus on the attack’s consequences presented by Schmitt and the Tallinn Manual, the threshold for these factors is unclear. For example, the Estonia DDoS attack⁵⁸ merely caused confusion and unrest, even though the attack was on Estonia’s infrastructure.⁵⁹ Under Schmitt’s and the Manual’s framework, would the Estonia cyberattack rise to the level of armed force, even though its consequences were minimal and trivial?⁶⁰ The answer is unclear, considering the ambiguous definitions and traditional understanding of “armed force.” Even using broad interpretations of “force,” many ambiguities surround applying Article 2(4) to cyberattacks.\nApplying Article 51 to cyberattacks is also problematic due to the issue of attribution. Attribution is a crucial step to claims of self-defense under Article 51.⁶¹ A state must know the perpetrator’s identity to retaliate under Article 51.⁶² Cyberattacks are distinguishable from conventional attacks because there are no soldiers, physical presence, or weapons to determine the\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nAlong these lines of retaliation, the type of force a state may use in retaliation is also ambiguous. Using the example of the severe DDoS attack against the U.S., the question is: Provided the U.S. knows which state perpetuated the attack, could the U.S. launch its own attack against the state and cripple that state's infrastructure? The U.S. would be bound to retaliate using another\"pure cyberattack\"(meaning no physical effect), considering the principles of necessity and proportionality.⁶⁷ However, what if, for some reason, a\"pure cyberattack\"was not a viable option for the U.S.? Could the U.S. respond with physical force, or must it forego its right of self-defense? Once again, the current laws of war do not answer this question.\nAnother problematic element of the laws of war is that non-state actors cannot violate Article 2(4) because it applies only to state actors.⁶⁸ It is common practice for governments to contract individuals or groups of hackers to attack states.⁶⁹ If a non-state actor carries out a cyberattack, the attacked state cannot enjoy the right of self-defense under Article 51. In addition, under the current principles of jus ad bellum, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda may launch cyberattacks against states with (in theory) no retaliation since al-Qaeda is not a state actor. Once again, this Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] appears to be the wrong conclusion, especially considering the large number of non-state actors that launch cyberattacks.\n## III. CROSS-BORDER AGGRESSIVE CYBERATTACKS BETWEEN STATE ACTORS ### A. Estonia DDoS Attack In 2007, Estonia became the first victim of a cyberattack sponsored by a state actor.70 The cyberattacks were in response to the Estonian government's choice to relocate a Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn.71 The type of attack utilized was the Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\"), one of the most commonly used cyberattacks.72 DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a site with fake requests to the point that the site cannot respond to all requests, and subsequently, the site crashes.73 The DDoS attacks targeted the Estonian\"government and parliamentary portals, ministries, news outlets, internet service providers, major banks, and small businesses.\"74 These attacks profoundly affected Estonia's infrastructure due to the state's heavy reliance on the Internet.75 This tiny nation, dubbed e-Estonia, is at the forefront of e-democracy76 and is recognized as the world's most advanced digital society.77 The sites of the two biggest Estonian banks were offline for about forty-five to ninety minutes, blocking access to simple financial tasks such as accessing or transferring money.78 Also, the\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nRegarding responsibility, no concrete evidence exists attributing the cyberattack to a state. However, there is information available to suggest that Russia could have been at least indirectly responsible for the attacks.⁸⁰ Evidence of Russian responsibility included IP addresses tracing back to the computers of Russian government agencies, the Russian government's refusal to assist the Estonian government in resolving the attacks,⁸¹ and DDoS online attack instructions written in Russian.⁸² Furthermore, Russia severed commercially important railways with no prior notice for alleged repairs during the attacks.⁸³ While the Russian government completely denies responsibility,⁸⁴ the overwhelming evidence points to some Russian government orchestration, especially considering the funding needed for such attacks.⁸⁵ However, since no\"smoking gun\"proves Russian government involvement, it is difficult to attribute the attack to Russia properly. There was, however, one conviction in connection with the cyberattacks. Dmitri Galuškevits, an Estonian student of Russian origin, was convicted for targeting a political party's website.⁸⁶ The size of the operation suggests many others were responsible for the attacks, however, due to Russia's non-cooperation, the rest remain without any repercussions.⁸⁷ Applying the laws of war to the Estonian cyberattacks yields contradicting results, showing exactly why another solution is Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] needed. Michael Schmitt applies his “use of force” framework and concludes that the Estonian cyberattacks rose to the level of “armed force.”88 Schmitt cites the severe consequences of the attack, such as the disruption of government function and services, economic turmoil, and adverse effects on the Estonian people.89 Likewise, Schmitt reasons the attacks were immediate, direct, invasive, and presumably illegitimate.90 Schmitt concedes there is difficulty quantifying the consequences of the cyberattack as the only factor opposing the conclusion. Balancing all the elements, Schmitt concludes, “the incident arguably reached the use-of-force threshold.”91 Interestingly, Reese Nguyen comes to the opposite conclusion using this same framework on the Estonian cyberattacks.92 Nguyen claims (1) the cyberattacks were not that severe due to lack of injury and destruction; (2) the consequences were delayed; (3) the effects were not directly tied to the DDoS attacks; (4) there was minimal invasion due to the remote execution of the cyberattacks; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify; and (6) since the attacks were legitimate because they were limited to telecommunication systems.93 Using the same (widely accepted94) framework to determine whether a cyberattack amounts to the “use of force” and reaching contradictory conclusions exposes the inadequacy of applying jus ad bellum to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the contradictory framework of Article 2(4), applying Article 51 to the Estonian cyberattacks would also be problematic. Since the cyberattacks were not adequately attributed to Russia, Estonia could not use the right of self-defense outlined in Article 51. Even more problematic is that the cyberattacks against Estonia were carried out by non-state actors, meaning Articles 2(4) and 51 would not apply to them.\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nAnother aspect of this cyberattack is the implication of NATO Article 5,⁹⁵ which would evoke a collective defensive response against Russia from NATO members.⁹⁶ Some experts speculate that the Russian government purposefully fell short of the threshold for invoking Article 5 due to the severe repercussions it may face from NATO's collective defense.⁹⁷ While Article 5 was not invoked in the Estonia cyberattacks, it is clear that NATO will defend its allies against a cyberattack.⁹⁸ Article 5 serves as another layer of defense for NATO countries against serious cyberattacks, a resource that should be used more often.\n## B. Cyberattacks Between Russia and Ukraine While there is a physical war between Russian and Ukraine,⁹⁹ the battle is also occurring in cyberspace. Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine began as early as 2014.¹⁰⁰ Three days before the referendum vote on the status of Crimea, Russia launched an eight-minute DDoS cyberattack against Ukraine to\"destabilize communications and spread confusion whilst troops overran the region.\"¹⁰¹ Also in 2014, a pro-Russian hacking group carried out cyberattacks to manipulate voting in the Ukrainian presidential election.¹⁰² The hackers targeted the Central Election Commission in an attempt to change election results.¹⁰³ More notably, in 2015 Russia carried out another DDoS attack that affected energy Stetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] distribution companies and left over 230,000 Ukrainian citizens without power for one-to-six hours.¹⁰⁴ The infamous Russian hacking group, Sandworm, is attributed to this cyberattack.¹⁰⁵ The destructive attack is believed to be the first example of a power outage caused by a cyberattack.¹⁰⁶ The malware used in this attack is called “BlackEnergy,” a malware also known to have compromised NATO, many Western European countries, and energy companies.¹⁰⁷ Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, cyberattacks from Russia soared in early 2022.¹⁰⁸ On January 14, 2022, Russian hackers brought down seventy Ukrainian government websites, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education.¹⁰⁹ Before the sites went down, a message appeared in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish that read “Prepare for the worst” and warned Ukrainian citizens, “All your personal data has been sent to a public network. All data on your computer is destroyed and cannot be recovered.”¹¹⁰ Right before the invasion on February 14, 2022, a DDoS attack targeted websites of Ukraine’s armed forces, public radio, and two of the biggest national banks.¹¹¹ The cyberattack brought down the banks for two hours and rendered the mobile apps and online payments inoperable.¹¹² Following Russia’s invasion, a number of cyberattacks ensued, including the KA-SAT satellite network¹¹³ and more cyberattacks on Ukraine’s digital infrastructure blocking access to financial services and energy.¹¹⁴ Another notable interruption includes a cyberattack on a Ukrainian radio station\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nWhile Ukraine has been successful at fighting off the bombardment of cyberattacks since the Russian invasion, experts are speculating that Russia may be holding back¹¹⁶ and is set to escalate its cyberattacks against Ukraine.¹¹⁷ In its February 2023 Threat Analysis Group, Google assessed Russia will “increase disruptive and destructive attacks in response to developments on the battlefield that fundamentally shift the balance... toward Ukraine.”¹¹⁸ Cyber threat group, Recorded Future, also noted in its February 2023 report that “in the near term, Russia will very likely launch a renewed offensive in Ukraine.”¹¹⁹ If the prediction of increased cyberattacks is true, invoking Articles 2(4) and 51 should be considered. Applying Article 51’s use of self-defense might not be problematic in this instance because the cyberattacks against Ukraine have already been attributed to Russia, and it is clear any further cyberattacks will also be attributed to the Russian government. The familiar problem would be applying Article 2(4). The definition of “armed force” is extremely limited and traditionally includes only physical force and effects. However, considering more modern interpretations of “armed force,” an argument could be made that the consequences of Russia’s cyberattack are not minimal. If Russia plans to ramp up its cyberwarfare, Russia may be successful at shutting down Ukraine’s electric grid as it has tried in the past. As mentioned before, the ambiguity of what constitutes “armed force” makes it difficult to apply this law. However, an attack of this magnitude may be enough to trigger Article 2(4), regardless of any physical destruction.\n¹¹⁵. Brumfield, supra note 109.\n¹¹⁶.

An Iranian intelligence agency hacker broke into a Dutch Security Company, called DigiNotar, and issued fraudulent encryption certificates, which allowed the Iran to spy on all Iranian Gmail users.¹³⁸ The hacker breached the company by adding a rule in a router that forced Google's traffic through another route inside the country.¹³⁹ While most victims of Iran's cyberattacks are Iranian or surrounding countries, Iran has carried out major cyberattacks on U.S. banks.¹⁴⁰ In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment of\"seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam (ITSEC) and Mersad Company (MERSAD), that performed work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on computer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\"¹⁴¹ The DDoS attacks allowed the hackers access to forty-six financial institutions, including\"Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&amp;T and HSBC.\"¹⁴² Some days, the cyberattacks overwhelmed computer servers with as\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## IV.

Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin added thousands of satellites to the Earth's low orbit.¹⁵⁴ For example, SpaceX plans to send over 40,000 Starlink satellites into space to provide low-cost Internet to remote areas worldwide.¹⁵⁵ With more plans to launch satellites from SpaceX and other companies, comes more demand for building satellites cheaper and faster.¹⁵⁶ The rapid building of satellites is of increasing interest¹⁵⁷ due to the possibility of companies cutting corners to decrease costs and speed up production.¹⁵⁸ The commercial space industry boom has opened the door for more cyberattacks. There are more non-government space actors than ever, and the highly technical aspect of building satellites allows multiple manufacturers to be involved in a single satellite.¹⁵⁹ These new realities create new targets along an extensive supply chain that companies and governments are not currently equipped to handle.\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nOne example of the consequences a cyberattack may have on a satellite comes via the Viasat KA-SAT case. On February 24, 2022, the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a cyberattack was launched against Viasat's KA-SAT satellite broadband service.¹⁶⁰ The cyberattack impacted the internet access of tens of thousands of Ukrainian and EU citizens and severed the remote monitoring access of 5,800 wind turbines of a German energy company.¹⁶¹ The malware used to carry out the attacks is called\"AcidRain,\"designed to remotely\"wipe modems and routers.\"¹⁶² The AcidRain malware bears coding similarities with another malware previously attributed to Russia's Sandworm group.¹⁶³ This piece of evidence, along with the suspicious timing of the cyberattack, leads many to conclude Russia sponsored the cyberattack.¹⁶⁴ The U.S. formally attributed the satellite cyberattack to Russia in a press statement by the Secretary of State.¹⁶⁵ While the U.S., E.U., and other countries condemned the cyberattacks, there was no discussion of its applicability to Articles 2(4) and 51, nor NATO Article 5 repercussions.¹⁶⁶ Such inaction to punish Russia continues to set a dangerous precedent of allowing state-sponsored malicious cyberattacks.\n¹⁶⁰.

W32.Gammima.AG Virus on the International Space Station In 2008, Windows XP laptops on the International Space Station (ISS) were infected with a virus called W32.Gammima.AG.¹⁶⁷ The virus was linked to Russian astronauts who carried infected USB devices on the ISS and spread the computer virus to infected computers.¹⁶⁸ Although the virus is considered a low-level threat, the ability of a computer to become affected in the ISS exposed the flaws of the computers at the stations and their vulnerabilities to attacks.¹⁶⁹ Following the vulnerability, the United Space Allowance changed the computer systems on the ISS from Windows XP to Linux for more security.¹⁷⁰ ## B. Differences Between the Landscape of Space Law and Cyber Law One lesson cyberspace can learn from space comes from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.¹⁷¹ This treaty, negotiated at the height of the Cold War, codified important space principles still used today. The Outer Space Treaty declares that the exploration and use of outer space “shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries”¹⁷² and that outer space is free for exploration by all states.¹⁷³ However, it also limits some state activity, such as claims over outer space and celestial bodies,¹⁷⁴ and expressly prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in outer space.¹⁷⁵ While the Outer Space Treaty has not escaped\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## V. INTERNATIONAL CYBER TREATY\nThough it may be difficult to envision a Cyber Treaty that addresses the issues outlined in this Comment, European countries agreed to a comprehensive international cybercrime treaty in 2001.¹⁸⁰ The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”), among many other things, defines criminal offenses for cybercrime and establishes domestic procedures for prosecuting computer crimes.¹⁸¹ Moreover, the UN is working on another major Cybercrime Convention to deal with topics like international cooperation on cybercrime, law\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] enforcement's access to digital evidence, and strengthening procedural safeguards and human rights provisions.¹⁸² There has been an international treaty on cybercrime for over twenty years, and another one is forthcoming. Why is there no international treaty on cross-border cyberattacks sponsored by state actors? The answer is embedded in politics and conflicting state interests.\n## A. Defining Cyberattack The first step to drafting a successful International Cyber Treaty will be defining a cyberattack. Without a cohesive, agreed-upon definition of cyberattack, it is challenging to differentiate cyberattacks from cybercrime and cyberespionage.¹⁸³ The definition of cyberattack should be specific and concise, leaving no room for interpretation. Making the definition of a cyberattack too broad may open the door for differing interpretations and further disagreements.¹⁸⁴ While the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyberattack is a good starting point, its effect-based approach is problematic for several reasons.¹⁸⁵ First, the definition focuses on the cyberattack causing injury, death, or destruction to objects. Most cyberattacks do not cause such effects but rather result in, among other things, data loss and server disruption.¹⁸⁶ For example, the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused financial losses and general inconvenience to the public, but there was no injury, death, or destruction to objects.¹⁸⁷ Another issue with the Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattack is that it does not address the intent to cause injury, death, or destruction to objects. For instance, consider a Russian-sponsored cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, hoping to destroy it. If, for some reason, the cyberattack is not accomplished, it would not be deemed a\"cyberattack\"under the Tallinn Manual. A state actor should be held accountable for failed or uncompleted cyberattacks because the state intended to cause\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## B. Clear Attribution and Defense Guidelines\nAttribution is deemed to be the most challenging aspect of cyberattacks.¹⁸⁸ The Cyber Treaty must establish elements needed to attribute a cyberattack to the wrongdoing state. Along with the elements of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should outline the evidence a state must present to prove attribution. Evidence may include IP addresses, information from political sources, similarities to malware with known actors, the temporal proximity of similar cyberattacks, and using a “honeypot” to identify actors.¹⁸⁹ With these guidelines in place, states should no longer be able to shift responsibility to groups or individuals hired to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹⁰\nMoreover, attribution is crucial for a state’s legitimate claim of self-defense.¹⁹¹ Accordingly, the Cyber Treaty should outline how a state may defend itself in a cyberattack. It is important to clarify what kind of attack a state may retaliate with, whether purely cyber or a mixed attack. These guidelines should still be in accordance with the international principles of necessity and proportionality discussed previously.\n## C. Inclusion of Non-State Actors\nAlong the same lines of attribution, the Cyber Treaty should encompass the actions of non-state actors as cyberattacks. The laws of war do not apply to non-state actors, which is problematic when states employ groups or individuals to carry out cyberattacks.¹⁹² It is hypothesized that non-state actors could violate the laws of war if a “clear relationship” exists with a state.\n---\n¹⁸⁸. See Simmons, supra note 13, at 100.\n¹⁸⁹. See Nguyen, supra note 93, at 1105.\n¹⁹⁰. See discussion supra Section III.A.\n¹⁹¹. See Moore, supra note 21, at 242.\n¹⁹². See discussion supra Section II.B.3.\nStetson Business Law Review\n[Vol. 4.1]\n\nInstead, the Cyber Treaty should focus on state responsibility for the actions of non-state actors. First and foremost, a cyberattack must be considered state conduct if a state sponsors a cyberattack. More importantly, states should be held responsible for the acts of non-actors, especially when states knowingly allow\"its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"¹⁹⁵ Such a rule would hold states like Russia responsible for the acts of Russian hackers that carry out thousands of cyberattacks.¹⁹⁶ This framework would also remove the ability of states to claim plausible deniability for the actions of others because any cyberattack carried out within a state's territory would be the state's responsibility. Going further, even if there is no state involvement, the state should still be held responsible for not taking the appropriate measures to stop the attacks.\n## D. Possibility of an International Cyber Treaty While the idea of a Cyber Treaty is conceptually solid, many forces make its adoption uncertain in the real world.

Conflicting State Interests\nThe key players in the Cyber Treaty are Russia, China, and the U.S. Each state has different cyber goals. For example, Russia focuses on cyber policies that support state sovereignty and the ability to keep citizen loyalties in check.¹⁹⁹ China has similar goals as Russia and emphasizes the importance of preemptive cyberattacks.²⁰⁰ Meanwhile, the U.S. is focused on cooperation between international law enforcement agencies to stop cyberattacks and apprehend cybercriminals.²⁰¹ Despite multiple efforts by the Russian government²⁰² to reach an agreement on cyber matters with the U.S., the U.S. remains apprehensive about Russia's intentions, and with good reason.²⁰³ Although the U.S. and Russia have not agreed on most cyber issues, in 2015, Russia and China entered into a bilateral cyber treaty that pledges neither state will launch a cyberattack against the other.²⁰⁴ While this treaty only binds Russia and China, it marks a first step toward an International Cyber Treaty. I do not believe the conflicting state interests between China, Russia, and the United States will render a Cyber Treaty impossible. States should set\n¹⁹⁹. See Timothy L.

Moving Past the Politics\nRussia and the U.S. had even more significant ideological differences during the Cold War.²⁰⁶ Though cyberattacks cause catastrophic effects on the economy, infrastructure, supply chains, and more,²⁰⁷ the severity of the Cold War cannot be compared. The Cold War was not just a space race but also a nuclear arms race between the U.S. and Russia.²⁰⁸ These two nations were actively developing weapons of mass destruction and threatening each other with nuclear attacks.²⁰⁹ However, during the height of the Cold War, important agreements were reached, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere) and the Outer Space Treaty (outlawing weapons of mass destruction in outer space).²¹⁰ If the U.S. and Russia reached agreements during such tense and terrifying times, it should be possible to do the same in today's world. An International Cyber Treaty that provides rules and guidance on cyberattacks would benefit both countries and promote stability in the \"fifth battlespace.\"²¹¹\n## E. UN Expert Groups\nIn its capacity, the U.N. has attempted to address the complex issues of cyberspace and international law. The U.N. has\n\nApplying International Law to Cross-Border\n\nWhile these groups are important in developing norms and guidelines for cyber matters, the drawback of the groups is in their non-binding nature. Though some nations, namely Russia, that are part of these groups work with other experts to develop these guidelines, it is clear the rules are not being followed by the member-states. While the reports serve as important guiding principles all states should follow, the reality is they are not being properly adhered to. This is another reason why a Cyber Treaty is needed. There is only so much that non-binding norms and U.N. resolutions will do in getting states to cooperate with proper cyber behavior.\n\nThe above-mentioned group of experts (“Experts”) on this matter consists of twenty-five members from different U.N. member countries. Some of the countries participating in this group include the United States, Estonia, China, and notably, Russia.\n\nStetson Business Law Review [Vol. 4.1] In its latest July 2021 Report, the Experts built on their recommendations of the 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports which laid out eleven non-binding norms of state behavior in the context of international security.²¹⁸ Some of the norms outlined include states not knowingly allowing their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs, states taking appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from ICT threats, and states should not knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams.²¹⁹ These norms are further analyzed in the expert’s 2021 report on this matter, including examples of “the kinds of institutional arrangements that States can put in place at the national and regional levels to support their implementation.”²²⁰ For example, regarding the norm that states should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for wrongful acts using ICTs, the experts propose that “[a] State that is aware of but lacks the capacity to address internationally wrongful acts conducted using ICTs in its territory may consider seeking assistance from other States or the private sector in a manner consistent with international and domestic law.”²²¹ This norm is especially important in aiding developing countries that may not have adequate capacity to deal with these complex matters.\n\nAnother group that is currently working on cyber and information security matters is the above-stated open-ended working group (“Group”).²²² This Group convened for its fifth substantive session from July 24-28, 2023. At its eightieth session, the group will submit a final report to the General Assembly.²²³ In its first annual 2022 progress report, the Group noted that cyber cooperation and assistance between states “could be strengthened to ensure the integrity of the supply chain and\n\n2024] Applying International Law to Cross-Border\n\n## VI. CONCLUSION\nThis Comment focused on the application of the laws of war to cyberattacks. While there is no question the laws of war codified in the UN Charter apply to cyberattacks, the laws are insufficient in practice. Issues arise due to the nature of cyberattacks and the traditional definitions of \"force\" and \"armed attack.\" Moreover, there is difficulty in applying Articles 2(4) and 51 to cyberattacks due to proper state attribution and the exclusion of non-state actors. These challenges can be addressed by a Cyber Treaty negotiated by the three key players: the U.S., China, and Russia. Although the cyber interests and goals of the U.S. are different from those of Russia and China, the differences should not render a Cyber Treaty impossible. Much like during the Cold War with the passing of the Outer Space Treaty, the first step is to put politics behind and realize creating a Cyber Treaty could benefit all.\n²²⁴. Id.\n²²⁵.
