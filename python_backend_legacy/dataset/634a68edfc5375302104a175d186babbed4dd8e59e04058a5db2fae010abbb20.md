This article explores the definitional and theoretical problems in analysing the emerging cyber security field and seeks to provide an outline of the main strategic challenges that cyber attacks pose for NATO. The article evaluates the institutional structures and processes put in place by NATO to confront cyber threats and moves on to explore the extent of transatlantic unity around NATO's emerging doctrine for cyber defence. It is argued that NATO's response to cyber security is rooted in its prior adaptation to the changing security environment of the 1990s and the threat from international terrorism post 9-11. More recently, cyber attacks from state and state-sponsored actors have given impetus to NATO's emerging cyber security doctrine. The article finds that despite recent controversies over cyber surveillance, there is a considerable degree of unity within the alliance on the main cyber security issues. As a multilateral security organisation with a strong institutional foundation, NATO is also relatively well placed to respond to rapidly evolving cyber threats.\nKeywords: NATO; cyber defence; cyber security; strategy; institutional adaptation\nEver since its formation in 1949, NATO has gone through a sustained process of evolution, adding new members, new partners and new institutional capabilities. Now that the long and arduous ISAF mission in Afghanistan has formally ended, and in the context of a host of new security challenges -- including a newly assertive Russia, widespread instability across the Middle East and North Africa, and increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region -- the alliance must continue to adapt in order to stay relevant in a volatile and unpredictable security environment. One area of growing focus in this context is cyber security. This rapidly evolving security field featured prominently in NATO's 2010 Strategic Concept (NATO 2010a) and the alliance has invested considerable resources in enhancing its cyber capabilities and securing its networks against what former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has called an “exponentially increasing volume and sophistication of malicious cyber activity” (2013). In September 2014, at the NATO summit in Cardiff, NATO took a big step forward, recognising for the first time that cyber attacks against its members could prompt a collective response\nunder Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty (Rasmussen 2014). This enhanced Cyber Defence Policy put cyber security at the heart of NATO's operational outlook. The much-publicised cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in December 2014 have further heightened attention to cyber threats within the transatlantic community and provoked new sanctions against North Korean officials (Sanger et al. 2014).\nDespite advances in NATO's cyber security posture, unresolved tensions exist within the NATO membership on cyber security issues. Recent revelations by Edward Snowden relating to the US government's mass surveillance programmes, the development of offensive cyber capabilities within the US intelligence and defence community, and the willingness to deploy “cyber weapons” for strategic gain, as in the case of the Stuxnet attack against Iran, indicate that America may be intent on aggressively maximising its power in cyberspace. In contrast, in many European states, and within the European Union (EU) in particular, the current approach appears to be based on softer forms of cyber power, including the development of defensive capabilities, civil and criminal mechanisms, cyber security norms and legal frameworks (European Commission 2013). In addition to this apparent political divergence, NATO is only beginning to adapt to strategically different cyber security issues. A geographically located and focused alliance is now having to deal with a virtual realm through which malicious code can be deployed instantaneously from anywhere on the planet. Accurately identifying who is responsible for cyber attacks, responding to them and even preventing them, also appears to be considerably more difficult in cyberspace than in the physical world. The rapidly growing technological sophistication of malware, moreover, is such that NATO and its members are at risk of being permanently behind the cyber security curve.\nIn the context of these political and strategic challenges, this article seeks to establish and explore the parameters of NATO's cyber security role. Specifically, it asks whether NATO can be an effective cyber security actor and whether progress has been made in forging a unified transatlantic approach to cyber security issues. The article proceeds in three stages. First, it explores how cyber attacks are challenging traditional conceptualisations of security issues and identifies different categories of cyber security where a NATO role is developing. It is argued that NATO is focused primarily on defending its own digital networks, but that it is also forging a broader role in defending NATO members against cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. Second, the article charts the development of an institutional and policy focus on cyber security within the alliance from the early cyber attacks against NATO by Serbian hackers in 1999 through to the adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy in September 2014. In particular, this section highlights how the threat of acts of cyber terrorism in the post 9/11 security environment gave NATO impetus to invest in this area of security, but that in recent years, threats from NATO's more traditional adversaries, Russia and China, have driven policy. Third, the article explores NATO's emerging collective cyber security doctrine and reflects on how well-suited the alliance is to respond to the many political and strategic challenges posed by online threats. The article finds that differences between NATO members on cyber security, which stem from broader disputes over the response to international terrorism after 9/11, are not insurmountable. In fact, NATO's ability to refine its institutional, operational and political capabilities, as well as the ongoing need for multilateral responses to cyber threats, makes the alliance a valuable asset to its members.\nCyber security -- conceptual and strategic challenges\nThe definitional and conceptual challenges of the cyber realm are something that scholars have struggled with fairly continuously since “cyber security” entered the popular lexicon. As Laasme (2011, p. 61) has stated:“Even though it might not be NATO's mission to classify and define everything in cyber-space, it is the alliance's role to prevent crises, manage conflicts, and defend one another against attacks, including against new threats -- none of which can be conducted with vague directions and abstruse concepts.”\nThis applies in the same way to the study of cyber security issues. Some conceptual clarity is required.\nCyber security, at its most basic level, is about being secure from (a) cyber attacks -- efforts to disrupt, delay or destroy computer networks, and (b) cyber exploitation -- efforts to covertly obtain information from computer networks (Lin 2012, p. 48). These attacks can take a number of different forms, and new tools for cyber intrusion are constantly being developed. One of the most common forms of malicious online activity are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are aimed at crippling a target's ability to operate web-based content and communications by bombarding it with “packets” of information. Perhaps the most prominent example of such an attack was against Estonian government ministries and media outlets in 2007 in reaction to the dismantling of a Soviet memorial in Tallinn. Malicious viruses can also be sent to networked computers to render them inoperable and to destroy information stored on them. On the cyber exploitation side, “phishing” attacks are common. These involve an unwitting target clicking on a link in an email or a webpage which covertly downloads malicious software to the user's computer. An attacker is then able to gain control or access to information stored on that computer and the network it is attached to. In some cases, the extent of control that hackers are able to maintain over compromised computer networks is extensive. Botnets can be created, which are networks of compromised computers through which a hacker is able to monitor web traffic and access confidential information over a sustained period of time. According to NATO and the US government, the volume and sophistication of both cyber attacks and cyber exploitation is rising (Gebauer 2012, Strohm and Shields 2013).\nCyber security can be further conceptualised by considering the motivations of the attacker and the choice of target. In this respect, it is useful to divide cyber security issues into four main categories: cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. First, cyber crime is a growing cause for concern for NATO members. The vast majority of attacks in this area are carried out by private individuals or groups, directed against private individuals and businesses, and take the form of identity theft and financial fraud. In this respect, the motivation for the attacks is usually financial gain. According to the annual Norton cyber crime report, global cyber crime cost $113 billion dollars in 2013 with 378 million total victims (Norton 2013). In both Europe and America, cyber crime is a widespread problem. A recent survey suggested 12% of European internet users have had their social media or email account hacked, while 7% have been the victim of credit card or banking fraud online (European Commission 2014). In the US, financial losses from cyber crime may constitute as much as 1% of US GDP (Paresh 2013). While this is not a military threat, the rapid growth of organised online crime is being viewed as a serious threat to the national security of NATO members (National Security Council 2014).\nCyber espionage, as conducted by state actors, is another category of malicious online activity. This involves state controlled or directed cyber attackers targeting private businesses and foreign governments in order to steal sensitive information for commercial, political and military gain. Cyber crime is different from cyber espionage in that the former is conducted by private individuals or groups, and the latter is conducted by (or on behalf of) a state in order to enhance that state's knowledge and capabilities. Espionage is not a new security challenge and nations have always tried to covertly obtain information from their adversaries. Nevertheless, the advent of a global network of interconnected computers changes espionage dynamics profoundly. As Mohan (2013) explains, in reference to recent revelations about Chinese hacking: “That corporations spy on each other within and across nations is not new. It is the Chinese military's decision to deploy massive cyber resources against the US companies that is startling. China's massive cyber efforts have begun to blur the distinction between commercial espionage and national security.”\nChina's common counterclaim is that such accusations are themselves politically or commercially motivated and the Chinese government has often stated that there is no evidence linking attacks to the Chinese state (Anon 2013). Nevertheless, the scope of the problem, particularly for the US, is extreme. It has been estimated that in 2007 the US Department of Defense lost between 25 and 27 terabytes of data from its systems, which is about 5000 DVDs of information (Klimburg 2011, p. 47). This kind of data extrication would have been much more difficult to accomplish in the pre-computer age.\nCyber terrorism is another category of cyber activity and perhaps the most difficult to define. According to Rollins and Wilson (2007, p. 3), a cyber attack can qualify as an act of cyber terrorism if (a) its effects are comparable to a terrorist attack: “when computer attacks result in effects that are disruptive enough to generate fear comparable to a traditional act of terrorism”, or (b) if the intent is to coerce political change: “Cyber terrorism exists when unlawful or politically motivated computer attacks are done to intimidate or coerce a government or people to further a political objective”. Dorothy Denning takes a similar approach, describing cyber terrorism as attacks against computer systems designed “to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives”, and as either being violent or causing “enough harm to generate fear” (2000 cited Weimann 2004, p. 4). In a wider sense, there is growing evidence that terrorist organisations are using the internet for a variety of nefarious purposes, including promoting their ideology, garnering political support and planning terrorist attacks. In Iraq after 2003 the internet became a tool for insurgents to recruit suicide bombers (Curiel 2005). Groups like Al Qaeda Hezbollah and ISIS are become increasingly adept at using the internet in operations and appear to have already developed the knowledge and skills to conduct damaging cyber attacks (Lawson 2015). Security agencies in many countries have also been given enhanced authority to monitor the internet and email communications for terrorist activity, and government agencies, national militaries and critical infrastructure providers may be vulnerable to cyber attacks from terrorist groups. While no one has yet lost their life as a result of a cyber attack -- cyber terrorism is thus a non-violent form of terrorism -- political coercion and spreading fear through such attacks are beginning to become important strategic considerations.\nThe final dimension of cyber security is cyber warfare. This is another area where scholars and practitioners continue to debate definitions and where a significant degree\nof scepticism exists as to whether the term “cyberwar” itself is a helpful or accurate term (Rid 2012a, p. 10). Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (2011a) has referred to cyber attacks against NATO members as constituting “a new form of permanent, low-level warfare”, which necessarily would require long-term security cooperation to counter. Here, it is the political nature of cyber attacks against NATO, and that foreign states appeared to be directly involved, that distinguish them from other forms of online activity. Although acts of cyberwar have not to date been violent in themselves (as with cyber terrorism), cyber operations can add significantly to military campaigns by “amplifying” kinetic effects on the battlefield (Nye 2011, p. 27). Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, which was preceded by sustained cyber attacks against Georgian government and military units, and which arguably gave Russia a significant strategic advantage, is a prominent example in recent history (Korns and Kastenberg 2008). Nation states themselves are also using cyber attacks as part of military operations and incorporating cyber security into strategic and operational planning. In this sense, cyber security is being militarised and nationalised. The US army has officially acknowledged cyber warfare as an element of strategic doctrine and has a dedicated Cyber Command, tasked with coordinating the US military's defensive and offensive cyber warfare operations, counterintelligence and protecting military networks (Miles 2011). Close links between the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and cyber attacks were identified in February 2013 (Sanger et al. 2013) and, according to a 2011 report by the US Centre for Strategic and International Studies, 33 states include cyber warfare in their military planning and organisation (Lewis and Timlin 2011).\nCyber attacks are also an increasingly influential part of the operational environment in which NATO member states are involved. As US Marine Lt. Gen. R.P Mills has revealed, in reference to NATO's war with the Taliban in Afghanistan,“I was able to use my cyber operations against my adversary with great impact. I was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire, to affect my operations. (cited Satter 2012)”\nThe cyber domain has also been visible and influential in the conflicts in Syria and Libya. NATO took the lead role in running the ISAF operation in Afghanistan since 2003 and its members have vital strategic interests in the Middle East and North Africa. If this kind of activity is taking place in theatres where NATO is deployed, then it is natural to expect NATO to have an interest in developing cyber warfare capabilities.\nCyber security is thus a broad concept, and distinctions between different types of cyber attack need to be made. Cyber crime is clearly an area of growth activity, although it requires civil and legal responses. NATO has never been a police organisation or a criminal justice body, and a NATO role here may not be appropriate. Cyber espionage, however, is an area where a NATO role might be both appropriate and necessary, especially given that its own networks and facilities store highly sensitive and confidential information that could be used to the political and military advantage of non-NATO members. NATO would appear to have a natural stake in working towards the prevention of cyber terrorism. It is a high-profile organisation with members that have been subject to various forms of terrorism historically, and which has previously invoked Article 5, the collective defence clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, in response to the attacks by a non-state actor on 9/11. Cyber warfare is another area where a NATO role would appear to make sense. NATO forces have been involved in a wide\nJ. Burton\nrange of conflicts in the post-cold war era, and cyber operations are increasingly part of those conflicts and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.\nTable 1 categorises the multi-dimensional challenge of enhancing cyber security, and indicates areas where NATO may have core interests.\nAs well as operating in a number of different dimensions, cyber security is challenging some of the strategic thinking on which NATO is founded. First, the alliance's understanding of territory is changing. NATO has traditionally been an alliance based on defending its members from geographically proximate security threats. During the cold war in particular, emphasis was placed on the alliance's ability to hold off the Soviet Union \"... as far to the east in Germany as possible\" (NATO 1950), and even in the early post-cold war era, the geographical scope of NATO operations was self-evident. The conflicts in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) took place on NATO's physical periphery, in clearly defined (though disputed) territories, and had direct geo-political consequences for NATO members, including considerable cross-border refugee flows (Woodward 1995, p. 369). Cyber attacks, in contrast, occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet. This presents a new challenge to geographically defined and located security organisations. While there is some evidence of NATO going through a process of \"de-territorialisation\" in the post-cold war era (Yost 2010, p. 490), such as a focus on out of area operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya and anti-piracy operations in East Africa, the changing territorial dynamics of cyberspace pose significant questions for NATO's on-going strategic role. Can a geographically located alliance respond to a geographically indeterminate threat?\nAn interrelated problem for NATO in this area is attribution: accurately identifying who is responsible for instigating cyber attacks. When the United States was attacked on 9/11, the hijackers were quickly identified and NATO participated in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan on the basis of evidence that al Qaeda and the Taliban had been involved and complicit, respectively, in the attacks. But an intra-alliance controversy ensued over the widening of the War on Terror to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. As German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in August 2002,\nTable 1. Cyber security by target, category and motivation.\n|   | Cyber crime (criminal motivation) | Cyber espionage (enhance state capabilities) | Cyber terrorism (political coercion, to cause fear) | Cyber warfare (enhance military operations)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Target of cyber attacks:  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Private individuals | x |  |  |   |\n|  Business (non-critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Business (critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Government departments/facilities |  | x | x | x  |\n|  Military/defence forces |  | x | x | x  |\nCore NATO role - xxx\nPeripheral NATO role - xxx\nOur analysis shows that the threat comes primarily from Islamic terrorism. To date no one can rule out another major attack. Nor, however, has anyone proved so far that Saddam Hussein has any links with organisations such as al Qaeda. (cited Loewen and Nabers 2005)”\nThis was, at least in part, a problem of attribution, caused by having to face a transnational adversary that was not operating from a fixed geographical location. A similar challenge exists with respect to cyber security. Recent advances in “cyber-forensics” have allowed investigators to trace attacks to particular sources, but compared to fingerprints and other forms of physical DNA, these capabilities are imprecise (Nicholson et al. 2012). As NATO itself has recognised, “Attribution in Cyber-attacks proves extremely difficult to obtain and evidence is hard to capture” (NATO 2013). The aforementioned revelations about PLA involvement in cyber attacks against US companies and government facilities are illustrative of this dilemma. The attacks were traced to a specific building in Beijing, but proving or asserting individual, institutional and governmental complicity remained problematic. The attribution problem was also demonstrated in the more recent cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in 2014. The US government claimed North Korean involvement, but did not reveal specific digital evidence, and some cyber security experts pointed the finger at disaffected former employees of the Sony Corporation (Kiss 2014). There is also increasing evidence to suggest that states are supporting sub-state or state-affiliated actors in carrying our cyber attacks, such as networks of semi-autonomous “patriot hackers” (Klimburg 2011, p. 44). This makes attribution even more difficult and allows states to maintain a level of plausible deniability.\nAnother strategic conundrum that NATO faces in the cyber realm is its ability to deter cyber attacks. NATO has always been an organisation based on building and maintaining a deterrent, both through nuclear weapons and conventional capabilities. During the cold war, military planners aimed to punish the enemy in the event of an attack -- through retaliation, deny their enemy the ability to fulfil the objectives of a military strike -- through dispersion of targets, for example, and/or compel an enemy to desist from attacks -- through economic, political or military inducements. After the demise of the Soviet Union, deterrence continued to be a central part of NATO doctrine and was prominent in the 1991 Strategic Concept (NATO 1991). Even in the post 9-11 era, NATO held on to this concept in confronting terrorism. The 2003 Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism, for example, was based on “... the assumption that it is preferable to deter terrorist attacks or to prevent their occurrence rather than deal with their consequences” (NATO 2002). Deterrence was also absorbed into specific counterterrorist operations, such as Operation Active Endeavour, a naval exercise in the Mediterranean that was intended to “... deter, defend, disrupt and protect against terrorism” (NATO 2010b).\nBut NATO may not be so well placed to deter attacks in cyberspace. Tang Lan and Zhang Xin have argued that “the anonymity, the global reach, the scattered nature, and the interconnectedness of information networks greatly reduce the efficacy of cyber deterrence and can even render it completely useless” (Lan and Xin 2010, p. 1). Similarly, James Lewis has outlined how asymmetric vulnerabilities to attack, new classes of opponents with very different tolerance of risk, and the difficulty of crafting a proportional and credible threat, all erode the ability to deter in the cyber and space domains (2012 cited Anon 2012). A number of other weaknesses exist in the cyber deterrence framework. Nuclear weapons are capable of causing absolute devastation against a\npotential attacker. The possible scale and impact of cyber retaliation is, at least at current levels of cyber capabilities, far lower. Escalation is another option, whereby a cyber attack would be met by a conventional military response, such as a missile strike. These questions have been on NATO member's agendas. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan, for example, has said that, “A response to a cyber-incident or attack on the US would not necessarily be a cyber-response. All appropriate options would be on the table if we were attacked” (2011 cited Spillius 2011). However, if cyber attackers can remain anonymous, and continue to be free from any legal censure, and if NATO cannot reliably punish cyber attackers, deny the attackers the ability to mount attacks, or compel them to desist from mounting attacks in the first place, a NATO role in cyber security may not be an effective one.\nThese strategic issues are central to whether NATO can be an effective organisation in responding to the growing threat from cyber attacks and pose a number of important questions. Can NATO overcome the changing territorial dynamics of cyber security? Can attacks against NATO members be reliably attributed to specific actors? Can NATO deter cyber attacks?\n## NATO's institutional adaptation\nExplanations of NATO's evolving post-cold war role can be divided into three main theoretical camps. Realist and neorealist scholars have emphasised the continuity of external threats and have viewed the perpetuation of NATO as being based on the US desire to control and influence European members of the alliance (Walt 1997, Gelpi 1999, Waltz 2000). Institutionalist scholars have emphasised the adaptability of NATO to new security challenges and emphasised such concepts as path dependence and institutional “stickiness” as explaining NATO's perpetuation, which is to say that the adaptation of NATO structures has been seen as preferable to the reinvention/reestablishment of the alliance (Tuschoff 1999, Wallander 2000, Thies 2009). Constructivist scholars have focused more on NATO's common identity as a community of democracies and the desire to expand that community to Central and Eastern Europe (Risse-Kappen 1996, Schimmelfennig 1999, Van Ham 2001). Arguably, all three of these approaches are of utility in expanding NATO's emerging cyber security role. NATO members have consistently emphasised the threat from cyber attacks, and that the threat comes from state and state-supported actors (realism); there has been a concerted effort to adapt NATO's institutions, operations and doctrines to respond to cyber attacks (institutionalism); and cyber attacks cannot be separated from identity politics, even when the identity of cyber attackers is hard to establish (constructivism).\nThis section of the article combines insights from realist and institutional approaches to alliance transformation and argues that cyber threats have driven institutional change within NATO. In this respect, NATO has been under pressure to adjust its functions and design to deal with changing environmental demands (Dijkstra 2015, p. 130). This process of evolution has taken place slowly and incrementally and has been only one facet of a broader adaptation on the part of the alliance to a diversifying and globalising security environment. It should also be noted that institutional adaptation is not a guarantee of effectiveness (Menon and Welsh 2011). Nevertheless, NATO's institutional strength and adaptability has made it a useful tool for dialogue, policy development and decision-making on cyber security within the Euro Atlantic area, and created opportunities for developing unified positions on the core issues.\nMore specifically, there appear to have been four drivers of this process of institutional evolution. First, NATO has taken steps to enhance its cyber security due to its operational experiences, including in Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan from 2003 and Libya in 2011. These conflicts have taken on a cyber dimension and NATO has had to incorporate cyber into strategic planning as a result. Second, the events of 9/11 created serious concerns within NATO over cyber terrorism (and terrorist use of the internet more broadly) and this has driven NATO's cyber security focus. Third, geostrategic rivalries with Russia and China have taken on an increasingly online dimension and NATO has responded accordingly. Fourth, the volume and severity of cyber attacks against NATO itself and its members has increased rapidly in the last decade. These changing dynamics have given NATO's political leaders incentives to enhance NATO's cyber security capabilities and created “triggers” for institutional change (Cortell and Peterson 2002).\nCyber security first appeared on NATO's formal agenda at the 2002 Prague Summit, where NATO members committed to the “Initiation of measures to strengthen defence against cyber attacks” (NATO 2003). This new focus stemmed from the conflict in Kosovo in 1999, where pro-Serbian hackers had targeted NATO communications infrastructure with a view to affecting its war fighting capabilities. A NATO website responsible for promoting NATO's role in the conflict was subjected to sustained DDoS attacks from Serbian hackers, and Chinese hackers targeted NATO members in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, leading to the White House website being taken offline for three days (Messmer 1999). The summit highlighted NATO's “ability to adjust to new priorities and to adapt its capabilities in order to meet new challenges” (NATO 2003). This process of change was described as part of an “evolution” and was to occur “incrementally”, “on a continual and deliberate basis” (NATO 2003). In a more concrete sense, the 2002 summit established an institutional capacity to respond to this growing concern. A NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) was formed and the NATO Cyber Defence Programme was established.\nNATO also took on a more active role in the fight against terrorism at this time. (Ringsmose and Rynning 2011). The new commitment to cyber defence at the Prague summit was referred to as being part of a “package of measures ... to strengthen NATO's capabilities to defend against terrorism” (NATO 2003) and was endorsed when the alliance was grappling with its response to 9/11, the US intervention in Afghanistan, in which several NATO members took an early lead role, and in the context of a changing US national security strategy that placed counterterrorism at its core. The US government was also instituting domestic reforms at this time that influenced the NATO process. In October 2001, the Bush administration signed the Patriot Act into law, which enhanced the government's domestic and foreign surveillance powers, established the National Electronic Crime Task Force, extended government powers to intercept and access electronic communications, and enhanced America's digital forensics capabilities. Perhaps most significantly, the Act included provisions for classifying computer crimes as acts of terrorism for the first time (Podgor 2002). Further to this, the Bush administration created the Office of Cyberspace Security in the White House and appointed prominent counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, to lead it. The newly created Department for Homeland Security was also given a statutory cyber security role. Tom Ridge, its first Director, highlighted the extent of the US government's concerns at this time: “Terrorists can sit at one computer connected to one network and can create worldwide havoc. [They] don't necessarily need a bomb or explosives to cripple a\nsector of the economy or shut down a power grid” (2003 cited Weimann 2004). This may have been an example of cyber security hyperbole, but the fear created by 9/11 and the prospect of terrorist groups developing sophisticated cyber attack capabilities were significant drivers of the US government's response to cyber security issues in the early post-9/11 period and influenced NATO's growing role in this area of policy.\nThe NATO summit in Riga in 2006 further endorsed the need to continue efforts to enhance NATO's cyber security and emphasis was placed on securing NATO's own information systems against cyber attack (NATO 2006). Arguably, however, a broader NATO role in the cyber security of its members was still on the backburner. The 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, however, elevated the issue of cyber security within the alliance and shifted NATO's focus away from cyber terrorism to a focus on the threats posed by nation states and state-sponsored hackers. The attacks were thought to be a response to the removal of a monument to the Soviet liberation of Estonia, and took place over a sustained period of three weeks. All of the Estonian government's websites were shut down, along with the sites of two major banks, a number of political parties and three of the country's biggest news media organisations. From a strategic point of view, the attacks demonstrated a number of the problems outlined in the previous section, particularly the issue of attribution. The Estonian government accused the Russian government of instigating the attacks and saw Russia's refusal to participate in official investigations as confirming a level of culpability (Tikk 2011, p. 122). NATO officials strongly suspected Russian state involvement, but found no direct evidence of a link. One NATO spokesperson said, “I won't point fingers. But these were not things done by a few individuals. This clearly bore the hallmarks of something concerted” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). The Estonian attacks also prompted a vigorous and prolonged internal debate within the alliance as to whether a cyber attack could form the basis of an Article 5 commitment. Estonia's defence Minister acknowledged that,“At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country. (2007 cited Traynor 2007)”\nHowever, the sustained cyber assault was widely viewed as a violation of Estonia's sovereignty and even an encroachment on its territorial integrity. As Linnar Viik, a consultant to the Estonian government, asserted, “... this is not some virtual world. This is part of our independence. And these attacks were an attempt to take one country back to the cave, back to the Stone Age” (2007 cited Finn 2007). Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip asked, “What's the difference between a blockade of harbours or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government institutions and newspaper websites?” (2007 cited Rid 2012b). NATO also recognised the severity of the problem, with one Brussels-based official stating: “This is an operational security issue, something we're taking very seriously. It goes to the heart of the alliance's modus operandi” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). In 2007, however, NATO was some way from establishing whether cyber attacks constituted an “armed attack” as stipulated in Article 5, and implementing a collective response to the attacks was problematic given the difficulty of attribution. Nevertheless, the incident formed the basis of a more unified alliance approach to cyber security and the development of enhanced capabilities (Crandall 2014, p. 37).\nThe cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007 were not an isolated example of the evolving cyber threat. A number of other serious incidents raised the profile of cyber\nsecurity within NATO member states in late 2007 and 2008 and fuelled attention to strategic vulnerabilities within the transatlantic community. In August 2007, it was reported that Chinese hackers had broken into the networks of the German Chancellery and three other Berlin Ministries, and in November 2007 British intelligence agency MI5 stated that the PLA had been conducting a concerted campaign of cyber espionage against British businesses. In June 2008, Lithuania faced a barrage of cyber attacks after it vetoed an EU energy partnership deal with Russia. The Russian war against Georgia in August 2008 also featured Russian-based hackers using cyber attacks as a precursor to the invasion in order to create confusion among Georgian military units and government ministries and to prevent a coordinated response to the assault (Hollis 2011). Lastly, in November 2008, the US Pentagon issued a ban on all external hard drives after a USB drive was used by a foreign intelligence agency to upload spyware and data exfiltration software to Defence Department computers (NATO 2009).\nThis growth in malicious cyber activity in 2007--2008 created a window of opportunity to develop multilateral mechanisms to respond to cyber security threats and various such measures were put in place over the course of 2008. In January that year, as a direct result of the Estonia attacks, NATO members endorsed a new Cyber Defence Policy, and in March the North Atlantic Council (NAC) established the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA). The CDMA aimed to integrate the alliance's cyber security functions and provide support for NATO members in the event of cyber attacks. A NATO spokesperson described the role of the centre as, “defence, whether an attack comes from state, criminal or other sources” (2008 cited Grant 2008). Later in 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was established in Tallinn, Estonia. While not part of the formal NATO command structure, the centre has taken a role in advancing NATO cyber security doctrine policy and developing cyber security capabilities. It has also helped to reduce alliance-wide transaction costs through the NATO “Smart Defence” initiative. Wallander (2000) has explained how highly institutionalised alliances like NATO create “assets” which help to sustain the alliance even as the security environment changes. The formation of these bodies should be seen in this context. They have provided mechanisms for the pooling of resources, avenues for negotiations between NATO members on cyber issues, enhanced decision-making within the alliance, and created incentives for all members to develop multilateral approaches to cyber security rather than isolated national ones.\nThe next major institutional development for NATO was the inclusion of cyber security in the November 2010 Strategic Concept, the third such Concept to be released in the post-cold war era. This was another important milestone for the alliance and a firm indication that NATO members considered cyber security to be an important area of focus. The concept emphasised “the next phase in NATO's evolution” and the need for “continuous reform” to meet modern security challenges (NATO 2010a). On cyber security specifically, it stated that cyber attacks were not just a national problem, but a collective threat to the “prosperity, security, and stability” of the whole of the Euro Atlantic area, recognising that such attacks were becoming, “more frequent, more organised and more costly in the damage that they inflict on government administrations, businesses, economies and potentially also transportation and supply networks and other critical infrastructure” (NATO 2010a). Interestingly, while the concept made reference to NATO's “ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyber-attacks” (NATO 2010a), the notion of deterrence was notably absent.\nNATO's institutional adaption to the threat of cyber attacks continued with the adoption of a revised Cyber Defence Policy in 2011, which placed emphasis on minimum\nrequirements for cyber defence of national networks and an integrated system of cyber governance within NATO, with the North Atlantic Council as the ultimate driver of NATO policy and cooperation in this area. The revised policy was another landmark in NATO's strategic thinking on cyber security, highlighted the need for pragmatic responses to cyber attacks (not being constrained by Article 5, for example), and recognised the importance of prevention of and resilience to attacks (NATO 2011). The establishment of a Rapid Reaction Team in 2012 was also noteworthy. A team of six NATO computer experts were tasked with responding to cyber attacks in real time and re-establishing computer network functionality in the event of cyber attacks and/or network exploitation.\nA further notable contribution to NATO's adaptation to cyber security challenges was the publication of The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in March 2013. This document was produced by team of legal and technical experts working in conjunction with the CCD COE and aimed to codify and clarify possible responses to both the legal and strategic dilemmas around cyber attacks by apply existing international law to the cyber security arena. The document has advanced NATO's legal and strategic thinking on key cyber security issues, including on the problem of attribution, where it argues that states should bear some responsibility for cyber attacks emanating from within their jurisdiction. There are areas, however, that are underexplored in the document, including legal prohibitions on attacks that do not constitute a use of armed force and which take place outside of armed conflict (which still constitute the vast majority of cyber attacks), and kinetic-to-cyber operations, where conventional force might be used to destroy digital infrastructure (Fleck 2013, p. 322).\nFinally, in September 2014, at its summit in Cardiff, NATO members endorsed the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy. In many ways, this was the culmination of the policy debate that was started within NATO by the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As a result of the policy, NATO will consider (and potentially implement) a collective Article 5 response to cyber attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. This landmark in NATO's cyber security evolution is not without its problems. Uncertainty remains as to how a collective response can be implemented when attribution is problematic, and it is not clear what threshold a cyber attack would need to meet to trigger an Article 5 response. Minor intrusions into NATO networks are clearly not what NATO policy-makers have in mind. However, cyber attacks with a severe impact on the economy, critical infrastructure and national security of NATO members may well fall into this category. As Jamie Shea, head of NATO's Emerging Security Challenges division, has stated: “We are keeping that ambiguous so a potential aggressor does not get the idea they can carry out cyber attacks up to a certain level with impunity” (2014 cited Washford 2014). It is also unclear what a collective cyber response by NATO would actually look like. NATO does not have the authority to implement sanctions against states for cyber attacks; digital retaliation is difficult although not impossible, as can be seen in the case of the (still unclaimed) attacks against North Korea in response to the Sony hack; and an attack using conventional force, which has not been ruled out, would clearly need to be proportional to the original offence. Nevertheless, 15 years after NATO first experienced cyber attacks, the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy had brought cyber security firmly inside the purview of NATO's evolving responsibilities. It has indicated that the alliance will respond deliberately and proportionally to any significant attack depending on the extent of the damage, the level of attribution, and the motives and identity of the attackers (Abrial 2011) (Table 2).\nDefence Studies 309\n# NATO's cyber security doctrine\nAlthough this institutional change has occurred incrementally, and has been driven by a diverse set of events and actors, cyber security appears to have found a foothold in NATO's doctrine for the defence of its members and for the general employment of NATO power in the post-cold war era. But what do these institutional developments tell us about NATO's collective cyber security doctrine? How do these capabilities, policies and institutions actually shape how NATO acts in cyberspace, and do they constitute a unified or uniform approach to cyber security across the transatlantic region?\nNATO's first priority has always been to defend the North Atlantic area, and, even though cyber threats emanate from cyberspace, the alliance's doctrine is still, for the most part, focused on the protection of its own computer networks. NATO's cyber command is centrally located in Brussels, where the CDMA and NCIRC provide coordination, real-time monitoring capabilities and intelligence sharing functions (Hughes 2009), and alliance officials are aware of the need to protect NATO's digital infrastructure spread across its many international sites. While NATO has taken a broader role in cyber defence as a result of the recent adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, its own operational security is paramount.\nSecond, NATO's cyber security doctrine and posture is still largely defensive. The alliance has not been involved in developing offensive cyber attack capabilities. These sorts of capabilities remain the purview of the national intelligence and security institutions of individual members. It may be that NATO's political and military command would be informed if a NATO member was involved in conducting offensive cyber security operations, especially if it was part of a wider NATO mission, but at the present time NATO's cyber command is not envisaged as having such a role.\nThird, although deterring cyber attacks is clearly not as straight forward as deterring conventional attacks from state actors, NATO cyber doctrine appears to be based in deterrence by denial. Given the difficulty of retaliating against cyber attackers and the inability to compel attackers to desist from attacks, denying them the ability to achieve their objectives has become the focus. NATO will make it as difficult as possible to infiltrate its systems and make sure hackers are aware that they are unlikely to be able to achieve their intended effects (Healey and van Bochoven 2012). Jamie Shea has recently highlighted the utility of this defensive posture (NATO 2010c).\nTable 2.

While NATO has clearly been influenced by the diffusion of power and influence away from the state in the post-cold war era, and particularly threats from terrorist groups and non-affiliated hackers, concerns about Russia and China have contributed to a revised sense of state adversaries during this period. Despite NATO's preponderance of power in other areas, its strategic rivals have proved highly capable in the cyber security arena. General Keith Alexander, head of the US Cyber Command, has described Russia as a “near peer” in terms of its cyber capabilities (2010 cited Giles 2011) and Giles (2011, p. 54) has argued both China's and Russia's emphasis on semi-autonomous agencies in cyber security operations gives them a distinct advantage over the US and its allies. Russian and Chinese-based hackers have regularly targeted NATO's networks in response to political disputes, most recently in response to NATO's stance on the Ukraine crisis (Croft and Apps 2014), and both countries have an interest in exfiltrating the confidential, operational, strategic and political information that flows through NATO networks. Although some attempts have been made to enhance cyber security cooperation between NATO and Russia, such as dialogue at the NATO-Russia Council level (Bendiek 2014, p. 12), the Russian annexation of Crimea and on-going efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine, which have taken place alongside new cyber attacks against NATO members, have put any meaningful cooperation on cyber issues on hold. The US Justice Department's indictment of five member of the PLA in May 2014 has similarly stalled any attempt to cooperate with China on cyber issues (Schmidt and Sanger 2014).\nLastly, as with many other areas of NATO's security doctrine, NATO's approach to cyber security is based around developing cooperative relationships, both internally and externally. NATO has developed a range of formal partnerships in the post-cold war era that are increasingly addressing cyber security issues, including the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI), the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). Cyber Security is increasingly a component of the Individual Partnership Action Plans (IPAPs) negotiated with countries around the world, such as New Zealand, and NATO has developed enhanced links with the private sector and critical infrastructure providers in advancing cyber defence in the North Atlantic area (NATO 2014). These diverse networks of partnerships allow for global cooperation on cyber security issues and help to develop cyber security norms, standards and capabilities. In this respect, NATO's cyber security doctrine covers and is part of each of its three main operational pillars: Crisis Management (e.g. the crisis surrounding the cyber attacks against Estonian in 2007), Collective Defence (e.g. the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy) and Cooperative Security.\n## A transatlantic divide?\nNATO has frequently been beset by intra-alliance tensions and in the cyber security arena there appears to be at least some evidence of a divergence in European and US policy approaches. Recent revelations by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, for example, have exposed transatlantic tensions around surveillance, and the alleged NSA hacking of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, which led to an angry phone call between Obama and Merkel and the summoning of the US Ambassador to Germany, was a major embarrassment for the US government (Wilder 2013). The US has arguably taken a harder security stance on cyber issues since 9/11 because of its desire to protect the US homeland, and because it faces increased strategic rivalry from rival global\npower centres. A more aggressive cyber posture can certainly be seen in the establishment of the US Cyber Command, a unified and expanding military command structure tasked with coordinating defensive and offensive cyber operations for all branches of the US military, the deployment of the Stuxnet software against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the Patriot Act, and the mass surveillance programmes run by the NSA, including the Prism programme. The use of offensive and even pre-emptive operations by the US government has also grown in recent years, with a high number of ICT specialists employed to penetrate foreign networks (Gellman and Nakashima 2013). In 2012, Obama signed Presidential Decision Directive 20, a classified document that gave the US military the authority to conduct more aggressive cyber operations to thwart cyber attacks against US systems (Nakashima 2012).\nThe wealth of cyber resources and capabilities that exist within the US military and associated agencies may be a reason in and of itself why the US approach to managing cyber conflict has been dominated by that branch of the US government. Mary O Connell takes up this line of argument, suggesting that the US government has become “trapped in an ideology of militarism” (O'Connell 2012, p. 191) and claiming that “the US military today has the largest concentration of expertise and legal authority with respect to cyberspace” (O'Connell 2012, p. 187). She further notes that in 2009, following the Estonia attacks, the Russia Georgia war and the release of the Stuxnet virus, the US government “began releasing a number of policies on cyber security that were predominantly military in orientation” (O'Connell 2012, p. 188). This would seem to support the line of argument advanced by this article, that threats from state rather than non-state actors explain the elevation of cyber security as an issue within the transatlantic security community.\nThis hard power approach to cyber security in the US could also be explained by the rhetoric being used to describe cyber attacks in the American context. Former Defence Secretary Leon Panetta's claim that the US could face a “cyber Pearl Harbour” is a prime example of the securitisation and militarisation of cyber discourse. When there is a propensity at the highest levels of government to adopt Second World War and cold war analogies to characterise cyber conflict, this can shape US policy and doctrine in a certain direction. Shachtman and Singer (2011) argue that clear links can be found between cold war strategic thinking and the formulation of current US policy, especially the idea that cyber attacks might be met with conventional attacks; an idea “lifted” from the 1960s strategy of flexible response. Commercial and political motives might also have led to the US taking a more military-based approach to cyber security issues. They further argue that “there is a massive amount of threat inflation going on in Washington's discussion of online dangers, most frequently by those with political or profit motives in hyping the threats” Shachtman and Singer (2011). While we should be careful in suggesting that a new “cyber industrial complex” is forming in America, the huge US government spending on cyber protection for the federal government, such as a $1 billion contract awarded to Raytheon by the Department for Homeland Security in 2015, may create incentives for responses to cyber security threats to be militarised. Equally, threat inflation may displace attention from the arguably more pervasive problem of cyber crime.\nIn Europe, at least on the surface, a softer cyber security approach is evident. EU responses to cyber security have typically emphasised criminal and civil procedures for dealing with cyber attacks, reflecting a European preference for soft power over hard power, and there has been a broader reluctance in Europe to militarise cyberspace. The new European Union Cyber Security Strategy, for example, is based on promoting\nnorms in cyberspace, encouraging dialogue between nations, enhancing technical capacity and resilience, and fighting cybercrime (Ashton 2013). The most controversial aspect has been the requirement for businesses in Europe, and particularly critical infrastructure providers, to report cyber attacks to a central authority. Overall though, the strategy is defensively orientated and non-militaristic.\nThe level of transatlantic divergence on cyber security issues should not be overstated, however. Given the impact of 9/11 on the US national security establishment, it is not surprising that the balance in America has tilted towards security over privacy in the decade or so since the attacks. In the context of the rise of China, the US pivot to Asia and an increasingly assertive Russia, the US is also bound to have an interest in staying ahead of its state competitors in cyber space. The US has shown some restraint in the use of its cyber capabilities and a recognisable commitment to the emergence of normative constraints on cyber warfare. Offensive cyber attacks were considered by the Obama administration as part of the campaign against Colonel Gadhafi's Libya in 2011, but a reluctance to set a dangerous precedent in how wars are fought, as well as a degree of concern over securing Congressional support for such strategy, meant that the campaign was limited to conventional capabilities (Schmitt and Shanker 2011). The Obama administration has also announced plans to end mass surveillance programmes and has stated that the US will cease monitoring the personal communications of European leaders.\nWithin Europe there are also certain states that are moving closer to the US in developing harder cyber security capabilities, and doing so outside of the NATO framework. The UK government, for example, has taken steps to merge cyber security intelligence and military operations, and the French and German militaries are both developing offensive cyber capabilities (Lewis and Timlin 2011). As previously stated, while there has been no NATO-led process for offensive cyber security, NATO's leading powers, including the US, are pursuing similar strategies domestically.\nCommon interests, values and threats also continue to bind American and European approaches to cyber security together. Both sides of the Atlantic advocate an open and accessible global cyber commons with minimal government restrictions, and an open internet is seen by both sides as central to driving economic growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Americans and Europeans are also unified in their approach to fighting cyber crime and securing critical infrastructure (Bendiek 2014). This general approach stands in opposition to Russia and China, who are arguably more concerned with being able to control information that could destabilise their societies and who have argued for international rights to restrict and censor internet traffic on that basis (Farnsworth 2011). While this divide may be hindering wider international cooperation, it is evidence of a level of unity on the basic issues within the transatlantic area.\nIntra-alliance management of cyber security issues also remains an important area of focus for the NATO allies, not least because some NATO members are clearly more concerned about cyber security than others. Estonia, the NATO member victim to the most significant attacks on its critical infrastructure, does not have the same level of cyber security concerns as Portugal, for example. But this is not necessarily an impediment to a NATO cyber security role, especially as NATO members have tended to specialise and develop niche capabilities that benefit the wider membership. Perhaps now more than ever NATO's capability aggregation role -- amassing capabilities against a common threat -- and its role in facilitating “smart defence”, are of crucial importance (Morrow 1991). Former Secretary General Rasmussen emphasised this himself in 2011, saying that “Smart defence is about building security for less money by working\ntogether and being more flexible” (Rasmussen 2011b). In an environment where NATO members' defence budgets are under strain, and where the US is concerned about a lack of European Defence spending, specialisation within the alliance will be increasingly important. NATO's Cyber Security Centre of Excellence is an example of this concept in practice, where some NATO members (Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Spain) have invested in a valuable institutional resource that is beneficial to all members. Defence cooperation creates efficiencies and lowers transaction costs; this is being achieved through NATO's institutional frameworks and potentially lowering the scope for intra-alliance divides.\n## Conclusion\nWhile NATO has tried to come to terms with some of the strategic challenges involved in enhancing the cyber security of its members, there are still some unresolved and perhaps unresolvable cyber security issues. Reliably attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, responding to the diversity of actors involved and deterring cyber attacks, for example, will continue to be difficult and possibly intractable problems. NATO appears so far to have accepted this and adopted a cyber security posture that is pragmatic and deals with attacks on a case by case basis. Its defensive role, based around deterrence by denial, is appropriate given the reluctance to use the alliance for offensive cyber purposes, and its focus is in areas where it has a clear and compelling political and strategic interest; in cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and cyber warfare.\nThe defence of NATO's own digital networks continues to be of paramount importance. However, there is some evidence that the alliance is taking a wider and deeper role in cyber security in the North Atlantic area. The adoption of an Article 5 approach to cyber attacks is foremost in this regard, but the efforts that have been made to forge private sector partnerships and to develop normative and legal mechanisms for cyber security are also significant. Ultimately, cyber security remains a national responsibility for NATO members.\nWhat is perhaps most remarkable about how NATO has adapted to cyber security challenges is the institutional capacity the alliance has put in place. This institutional development has been driven mostly by external threats, from terrorist groups initially, but most recently by state actors, and these have accelerated the political and institutional focus on cyber security within the alliance. The alliance's integrated military command has always been one of its most important institutional assets and has historically allowed NATO members to coordinate military operations. The political integration and coordination provided by the North Atlantic Council has also been noteworthy throughout alliance history. In a similar vein, NATO now has a common cyber security capacity through which members can coordinate responses to cyber security incidents and provide channels of communication that are likely to continue to be important as cyber threats evolve.\nTransatlantic tensions on cyber security issues are certainly in evidence, and these stem from broader tensions between the US and Europe over the response to 9/11 and the role of the internet in surveillance. Despite this, there is a considerable degree of unity on the core cyber security challenges within the NATO membership. The balance between privacy and security will continue to be debated within NATO member states, but at this stage, this does not appear to be inhibiting a common and unified approach to at least defensive cyber operations. Whether NATO will take on an offensive cyber security posture at some stage will be an issue to monitor. The requirements of\nimplementing an Article 5 response to a major cyber attack might provide momentum for the development of offensive capabilities to be deployed as part of a unified NATO command, but it is more likely that NATO's most prominent players will continue to develop and deploy these kinds of capabilities outside of NATO channels.\nFinally, it is worth returning to NATO's core functions: collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. In all these areas, a NATO cyber security role would appear to have considerable merit. Global security challenges invariably require multilateral solutions and NATO has a range of adaptable institutional capabilities that are reasonably well suited to the task at hand.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

This article explores the definitional and theoretical problems in analysing the emerging cyber security field and seeks to provide an outline of the main strategic challenges that cyber attacks pose for NATO. The article evaluates the institutional structures and processes put in place by NATO to confront cyber threats and moves on to explore the extent of transatlantic unity around NATO's emerging doctrine for cyber defence. It is argued that NATO's response to cyber security is rooted in its prior adaptation to the changing security environment of the 1990s and the threat from international terrorism post 9-11. More recently, cyber attacks from state and state-sponsored actors have given impetus to NATO's emerging cyber security doctrine. The article finds that despite recent controversies over cyber surveillance, there is a considerable degree of unity within the alliance on the main cyber security issues. As a multilateral security organisation with a strong institutional foundation, NATO is also relatively well placed to respond to rapidly evolving cyber threats.\nKeywords: NATO; cyber defence; cyber security; strategy; institutional adaptation\nEver since its formation in 1949, NATO has gone through a sustained process of evolution, adding new members, new partners and new institutional capabilities. Now that the long and arduous ISAF mission in Afghanistan has formally ended, and in the context of a host of new security challenges -- including a newly assertive Russia, widespread instability across the Middle East and North Africa, and increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region -- the alliance must continue to adapt in order to stay relevant in a volatile and unpredictable security environment. One area of growing focus in this context is cyber security. This rapidly evolving security field featured prominently in NATO's 2010 Strategic Concept  and the alliance has invested considerable resources in enhancing its cyber capabilities and securing its networks against what former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has called an “exponentially increasing volume and sophistication of malicious cyber activity” (2013). In September 2014, at the NATO summit in Cardiff, NATO took a big step forward, recognising for the first time that cyber attacks against its members could prompt a collective response\nunder Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty . This enhanced Cyber Defence Policy put cyber security at the heart of NATO's operational outlook. The much-publicised cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in December 2014 have further heightened attention to cyber threats within the transatlantic community and provoked new sanctions against North Korean officials .\nDespite advances in NATO's cyber security posture, unresolved tensions exist within the NATO membership on cyber security issues. Recent revelations by Edward Snowden relating to the US government's mass surveillance programmes, the development of offensive cyber capabilities within the US intelligence and defence community, and the willingness to deploy “cyber weapons” for strategic gain, as in the case of the Stuxnet attack against Iran, indicate that America may be intent on aggressively maximising its power in cyberspace. In contrast, in many European states, and within the European Union (EU) in particular, the current approach appears to be based on softer forms of cyber power, including the development of defensive capabilities, civil and criminal mechanisms, cyber security norms and legal frameworks . In addition to this apparent political divergence, NATO is only beginning to adapt to strategically different cyber security issues. A geographically located and focused alliance is now having to deal with a virtual realm through which malicious code can be deployed instantaneously from anywhere on the planet. Accurately identifying who is responsible for cyber attacks, responding to them and even preventing them, also appears to be considerably more difficult in cyberspace than in the physical world. The rapidly growing technological sophistication of malware, moreover, is such that NATO and its members are at risk of being permanently behind the cyber security curve.\nIn the context of these political and strategic challenges, this article seeks to establish and explore the parameters of NATO's cyber security role. Specifically, it asks whether NATO can be an effective cyber security actor and whether progress has been made in forging a unified transatlantic approach to cyber security issues. The article proceeds in three stages. First, it explores how cyber attacks are challenging traditional conceptualisations of security issues and identifies different categories of cyber security where a NATO role is developing. It is argued that NATO is focused primarily on defending its own digital networks, but that it is also forging a broader role in defending NATO members against cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. Second, the article charts the development of an institutional and policy focus on cyber security within the alliance from the early cyber attacks against NATO by Serbian hackers in 1999 through to the adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy in September 2014. In particular, this section highlights how the threat of acts of cyber terrorism in the post 9/11 security environment gave NATO impetus to invest in this area of security, but that in recent years, threats from NATO's more traditional adversaries, Russia and China, have driven policy. Third, the article explores NATO's emerging collective cyber security doctrine and reflects on how well-suited the alliance is to respond to the many political and strategic challenges posed by online threats. The article finds that differences between NATO members on cyber security, which stem from broader disputes over the response to international terrorism after 9/11, are not insurmountable. In fact, NATO's ability to refine its institutional, operational and political capabilities, as well as the ongoing need for multilateral responses to cyber threats, makes the alliance a valuable asset to its members.\nCyber security -- conceptual and strategic challenges\nThe definitional and conceptual challenges of the cyber realm are something that scholars have struggled with fairly continuously since “cyber security” entered the popular lexicon. As Laasme (2011, p. 61) has stated:“Even though it might not be NATO's mission to classify and define everything in cyber-space, it is the alliance's role to prevent crises, manage conflicts, and defend one another against attacks, including against new threats -- none of which can be conducted with vague directions and abstruse concepts.”\nThis applies in the same way to the study of cyber security issues. Some conceptual clarity is required.\nCyber security, at its most basic level, is about being secure from (a) cyber attacks -- efforts to disrupt, delay or destroy computer networks, and (b) cyber exploitation -- efforts to covertly obtain information from computer networks . These attacks can take a number of different forms, and new tools for cyber intrusion are constantly being developed. One of the most common forms of malicious online activity are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are aimed at crippling a target's ability to operate web-based content and communications by bombarding it with “packets” of information. Perhaps the most prominent example of such an attack was against Estonian government ministries and media outlets in 2007 in reaction to the dismantling of a Soviet memorial in Tallinn. Malicious viruses can also be sent to networked computers to render them inoperable and to destroy information stored on them. On the cyber exploitation side, “phishing” attacks are common. These involve an unwitting target clicking on a link in an email or a webpage which covertly downloads malicious software to the user's computer. An attacker is then able to gain control or access to information stored on that computer and the network it is attached to. In some cases, the extent of control that hackers are able to maintain over compromised computer networks is extensive. Botnets can be created, which are networks of compromised computers through which a hacker is able to monitor web traffic and access confidential information over a sustained period of time. According to NATO and the US government, the volume and sophistication of both cyber attacks and cyber exploitation is rising .\nCyber security can be further conceptualised by considering the motivations of the attacker and the choice of target. In this respect, it is useful to divide cyber security issues into four main categories: cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. First, cyber crime is a growing cause for concern for NATO members. The vast majority of attacks in this area are carried out by private individuals or groups, directed against private individuals and businesses, and take the form of identity theft and financial fraud. In this respect, the motivation for the attacks is usually financial gain. According to the annual Norton cyber crime report, global cyber crime cost $113 billion dollars in 2013 with 378 million total victims . In both Europe and America, cyber crime is a widespread problem. A recent survey suggested 12% of European internet users have had their social media or email account hacked, while 7% have been the victim of credit card or banking fraud online . In the US, financial losses from cyber crime may constitute as much as 1% of US GDP . While this is not a military threat, the rapid growth of organised online crime is being viewed as a serious threat to the national security of NATO members .\nCyber espionage, as conducted by state actors, is another category of malicious online activity. This involves state controlled or directed cyber attackers targeting private businesses and foreign governments in order to steal sensitive information for commercial, political and military gain. Cyber crime is different from cyber espionage in that the former is conducted by private individuals or groups, and the latter is conducted by (or on behalf of) a state in order to enhance that state's knowledge and capabilities. Espionage is not a new security challenge and nations have always tried to covertly obtain information from their adversaries. Nevertheless, the advent of a global network of interconnected computers changes espionage dynamics profoundly. As Mohan (2013) explains, in reference to recent revelations about Chinese hacking: “That corporations spy on each other within and across nations is not new. It is the Chinese military's decision to deploy massive cyber resources against the US companies that is startling. China's massive cyber efforts have begun to blur the distinction between commercial espionage and national security.”\nChina's common counterclaim is that such accusations are themselves politically or commercially motivated and the Chinese government has often stated that there is no evidence linking attacks to the Chinese state . Nevertheless, the scope of the problem, particularly for the US, is extreme. It has been estimated that in 2007 the US Department of Defense lost between 25 and 27 terabytes of data from its systems, which is about 5000 DVDs of information . This kind of data extrication would have been much more difficult to accomplish in the pre-computer age.\nCyber terrorism is another category of cyber activity and perhaps the most difficult to define. According to Rollins and Wilson (2007, p. 3), a cyber attack can qualify as an act of cyber terrorism if (a) its effects are comparable to a terrorist attack: “when computer attacks result in effects that are disruptive enough to generate fear comparable to a traditional act of terrorism”, or (b) if the intent is to coerce political change: “Cyber terrorism exists when unlawful or politically motivated computer attacks are done to intimidate or coerce a government or people to further a political objective”. Dorothy Denning takes a similar approach, describing cyber terrorism as attacks against computer systems designed “to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives”, and as either being violent or causing “enough harm to generate fear” (2000 cited Weimann 2004, p. 4). In a wider sense, there is growing evidence that terrorist organisations are using the internet for a variety of nefarious purposes, including promoting their ideology, garnering political support and planning terrorist attacks. In Iraq after 2003 the internet became a tool for insurgents to recruit suicide bombers . Groups like Al Qaeda Hezbollah and ISIS are become increasingly adept at using the internet in operations and appear to have already developed the knowledge and skills to conduct damaging cyber attacks . Security agencies in many countries have also been given enhanced authority to monitor the internet and email communications for terrorist activity, and government agencies, national militaries and critical infrastructure providers may be vulnerable to cyber attacks from terrorist groups. While no one has yet lost their life as a result of a cyber attack -- cyber terrorism is thus a non-violent form of terrorism -- political coercion and spreading fear through such attacks are beginning to become important strategic considerations.\nThe final dimension of cyber security is cyber warfare. This is another area where scholars and practitioners continue to debate definitions and where a significant degree\nof scepticism exists as to whether the term “cyberwar” itself is a helpful or accurate term . Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (2011a) has referred to cyber attacks against NATO members as constituting “a new form of permanent, low-level warfare”, which necessarily would require long-term security cooperation to counter. Here, it is the political nature of cyber attacks against NATO, and that foreign states appeared to be directly involved, that distinguish them from other forms of online activity. Although acts of cyberwar have not to date been violent in themselves (as with cyber terrorism), cyber operations can add significantly to military campaigns by “amplifying” kinetic effects on the battlefield . Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, which was preceded by sustained cyber attacks against Georgian government and military units, and which arguably gave Russia a significant strategic advantage, is a prominent example in recent history . Nation states themselves are also using cyber attacks as part of military operations and incorporating cyber security into strategic and operational planning. In this sense, cyber security is being militarised and nationalised. The US army has officially acknowledged cyber warfare as an element of strategic doctrine and has a dedicated Cyber Command, tasked with coordinating the US military's defensive and offensive cyber warfare operations, counterintelligence and protecting military networks . Close links between the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and cyber attacks were identified in February 2013  and, according to a 2011 report by the US Centre for Strategic and International Studies, 33 states include cyber warfare in their military planning and organisation .\nCyber attacks are also an increasingly influential part of the operational environment in which NATO member states are involved. As US Marine Lt. Gen. R.P Mills has revealed, in reference to NATO's war with the Taliban in Afghanistan,“I was able to use my cyber operations against my adversary with great impact. I was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire, to affect my operations. (cited Satter 2012)”\nThe cyber domain has also been visible and influential in the conflicts in Syria and Libya. NATO took the lead role in running the ISAF operation in Afghanistan since 2003 and its members have vital strategic interests in the Middle East and North Africa. If this kind of activity is taking place in theatres where NATO is deployed, then it is natural to expect NATO to have an interest in developing cyber warfare capabilities.\nCyber security is thus a broad concept, and distinctions between different types of cyber attack need to be made. Cyber crime is clearly an area of growth activity, although it requires civil and legal responses. NATO has never been a police organisation or a criminal justice body, and a NATO role here may not be appropriate. Cyber espionage, however, is an area where a NATO role might be both appropriate and necessary, especially given that its own networks and facilities store highly sensitive and confidential information that could be used to the political and military advantage of non-NATO members. NATO would appear to have a natural stake in working towards the prevention of cyber terrorism. It is a high-profile organisation with members that have been subject to various forms of terrorism historically, and which has previously invoked Article 5, the collective defence clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, in response to the attacks by a non-state actor on 9/11. Cyber warfare is another area where a NATO role would appear to make sense. NATO forces have been involved in a wide\nJ. Burton\nrange of conflicts in the post-cold war era, and cyber operations are increasingly part of those conflicts and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.\nTable 1 categorises the multi-dimensional challenge of enhancing cyber security, and indicates areas where NATO may have core interests.\nAs well as operating in a number of different dimensions, cyber security is challenging some of the strategic thinking on which NATO is founded. First, the alliance's understanding of territory is changing. NATO has traditionally been an alliance based on defending its members from geographically proximate security threats. During the cold war in particular, emphasis was placed on the alliance's ability to hold off the Soviet Union \"... as far to the east in Germany as possible\" , and even in the early post-cold war era, the geographical scope of NATO operations was self-evident. The conflicts in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) took place on NATO's physical periphery, in clearly defined (though disputed) territories, and had direct geo-political consequences for NATO members, including considerable cross-border refugee flows . Cyber attacks, in contrast, occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet. This presents a new challenge to geographically defined and located security organisations. While there is some evidence of NATO going through a process of \"de-territorialisation\" in the post-cold war era , such as a focus on out of area operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya and anti-piracy operations in East Africa, the changing territorial dynamics of cyberspace pose significant questions for NATO's on-going strategic role. Can a geographically located alliance respond to a geographically indeterminate threat?\nAn interrelated problem for NATO in this area is attribution: accurately identifying who is responsible for instigating cyber attacks. When the United States was attacked on 9/11, the hijackers were quickly identified and NATO participated in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan on the basis of evidence that al Qaeda and the Taliban had been involved and complicit, respectively, in the attacks. But an intra-alliance controversy ensued over the widening of the War on Terror to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. As German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in August 2002,\nTable 1. Cyber security by target, category and motivation.\n|   | Cyber crime (criminal motivation) | Cyber espionage (enhance state capabilities) | Cyber terrorism (political coercion, to cause fear) | Cyber warfare (enhance military operations)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Target of cyber attacks:  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Private individuals | x |  |  |   |\n|  Business (non-critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Business (critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Government departments/facilities |  | x | x | x  |\n|  Military/defence forces |  | x | x | x  |\nCore NATO role - xxx\nPeripheral NATO role - xxx\nOur analysis shows that the threat comes primarily from Islamic terrorism. To date no one can rule out another major attack. Nor, however, has anyone proved so far that Saddam Hussein has any links with organisations such as al Qaeda. (cited Loewen and Nabers 2005)”\nThis was, at least in part, a problem of attribution, caused by having to face a transnational adversary that was not operating from a fixed geographical location. A similar challenge exists with respect to cyber security. Recent advances in “cyber-forensics” have allowed investigators to trace attacks to particular sources, but compared to fingerprints and other forms of physical DNA, these capabilities are imprecise . As NATO itself has recognised, “Attribution in Cyber-attacks proves extremely difficult to obtain and evidence is hard to capture” . The aforementioned revelations about PLA involvement in cyber attacks against US companies and government facilities are illustrative of this dilemma. The attacks were traced to a specific building in Beijing, but proving or asserting individual, institutional and governmental complicity remained problematic. The attribution problem was also demonstrated in the more recent cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in 2014. The US government claimed North Korean involvement, but did not reveal specific digital evidence, and some cyber security experts pointed the finger at disaffected former employees of the Sony Corporation . There is also increasing evidence to suggest that states are supporting sub-state or state-affiliated actors in carrying our cyber attacks, such as networks of semi-autonomous “patriot hackers” . This makes attribution even more difficult and allows states to maintain a level of plausible deniability.\nAnother strategic conundrum that NATO faces in the cyber realm is its ability to deter cyber attacks. NATO has always been an organisation based on building and maintaining a deterrent, both through nuclear weapons and conventional capabilities. During the cold war, military planners aimed to punish the enemy in the event of an attack -- through retaliation, deny their enemy the ability to fulfil the objectives of a military strike -- through dispersion of targets, for example, and/or compel an enemy to desist from attacks -- through economic, political or military inducements. After the demise of the Soviet Union, deterrence continued to be a central part of NATO doctrine and was prominent in the 1991 Strategic Concept . Even in the post 9-11 era, NATO held on to this concept in confronting terrorism. The 2003 Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism, for example, was based on “... the assumption that it is preferable to deter terrorist attacks or to prevent their occurrence rather than deal with their consequences” . Deterrence was also absorbed into specific counterterrorist operations, such as Operation Active Endeavour, a naval exercise in the Mediterranean that was intended to “... deter, defend, disrupt and protect against terrorism” .\nBut NATO may not be so well placed to deter attacks in cyberspace. Tang Lan and Zhang Xin have argued that “the anonymity, the global reach, the scattered nature, and the interconnectedness of information networks greatly reduce the efficacy of cyber deterrence and can even render it completely useless” . Similarly, James Lewis has outlined how asymmetric vulnerabilities to attack, new classes of opponents with very different tolerance of risk, and the difficulty of crafting a proportional and credible threat, all erode the ability to deter in the cyber and space domains (2012 cited Anon 2012). A number of other weaknesses exist in the cyber deterrence framework. Nuclear weapons are capable of causing absolute devastation against a\npotential attacker. The possible scale and impact of cyber retaliation is, at least at current levels of cyber capabilities, far lower. Escalation is another option, whereby a cyber attack would be met by a conventional military response, such as a missile strike. These questions have been on NATO member's agendas. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan, for example, has said that, “A response to a cyber-incident or attack on the US would not necessarily be a cyber-response. All appropriate options would be on the table if we were attacked” (2011 cited Spillius 2011). However, if cyber attackers can remain anonymous, and continue to be free from any legal censure, and if NATO cannot reliably punish cyber attackers, deny the attackers the ability to mount attacks, or compel them to desist from mounting attacks in the first place, a NATO role in cyber security may not be an effective one.\nThese strategic issues are central to whether NATO can be an effective organisation in responding to the growing threat from cyber attacks and pose a number of important questions. Can NATO overcome the changing territorial dynamics of cyber security? Can attacks against NATO members be reliably attributed to specific actors? Can NATO deter cyber attacks?\n## NATO's institutional adaptation\nExplanations of NATO's evolving post-cold war role can be divided into three main theoretical camps. Realist and neorealist scholars have emphasised the continuity of external threats and have viewed the perpetuation of NATO as being based on the US desire to control and influence European members of the alliance . Institutionalist scholars have emphasised the adaptability of NATO to new security challenges and emphasised such concepts as path dependence and institutional “stickiness” as explaining NATO's perpetuation, which is to say that the adaptation of NATO structures has been seen as preferable to the reinvention/reestablishment of the alliance . Constructivist scholars have focused more on NATO's common identity as a community of democracies and the desire to expand that community to Central and Eastern Europe . Arguably, all three of these approaches are of utility in expanding NATO's emerging cyber security role. NATO members have consistently emphasised the threat from cyber attacks, and that the threat comes from state and state-supported actors (realism); there has been a concerted effort to adapt NATO's institutions, operations and doctrines to respond to cyber attacks (institutionalism); and cyber attacks cannot be separated from identity politics, even when the identity of cyber attackers is hard to establish (constructivism).\nThis section of the article combines insights from realist and institutional approaches to alliance transformation and argues that cyber threats have driven institutional change within NATO. In this respect, NATO has been under pressure to adjust its functions and design to deal with changing environmental demands . This process of evolution has taken place slowly and incrementally and has been only one facet of a broader adaptation on the part of the alliance to a diversifying and globalising security environment. It should also be noted that institutional adaptation is not a guarantee of effectiveness . Nevertheless, NATO's institutional strength and adaptability has made it a useful tool for dialogue, policy development and decision-making on cyber security within the Euro Atlantic area, and created opportunities for developing unified positions on the core issues.\nMore specifically, there appear to have been four drivers of this process of institutional evolution. First, NATO has taken steps to enhance its cyber security due to its operational experiences, including in Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan from 2003 and Libya in 2011. These conflicts have taken on a cyber dimension and NATO has had to incorporate cyber into strategic planning as a result. Second, the events of 9/11 created serious concerns within NATO over cyber terrorism (and terrorist use of the internet more broadly) and this has driven NATO's cyber security focus. Third, geostrategic rivalries with Russia and China have taken on an increasingly online dimension and NATO has responded accordingly. Fourth, the volume and severity of cyber attacks against NATO itself and its members has increased rapidly in the last decade. These changing dynamics have given NATO's political leaders incentives to enhance NATO's cyber security capabilities and created “triggers” for institutional change .\nCyber security first appeared on NATO's formal agenda at the 2002 Prague Summit, where NATO members committed to the “Initiation of measures to strengthen defence against cyber attacks” . This new focus stemmed from the conflict in Kosovo in 1999, where pro-Serbian hackers had targeted NATO communications infrastructure with a view to affecting its war fighting capabilities. A NATO website responsible for promoting NATO's role in the conflict was subjected to sustained DDoS attacks from Serbian hackers, and Chinese hackers targeted NATO members in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, leading to the White House website being taken offline for three days . The summit highlighted NATO's “ability to adjust to new priorities and to adapt its capabilities in order to meet new challenges” . This process of change was described as part of an “evolution” and was to occur “incrementally”, “on a continual and deliberate basis” . In a more concrete sense, the 2002 summit established an institutional capacity to respond to this growing concern. A NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) was formed and the NATO Cyber Defence Programme was established.\nNATO also took on a more active role in the fight against terrorism at this time. . The new commitment to cyber defence at the Prague summit was referred to as being part of a “package of measures ... to strengthen NATO's capabilities to defend against terrorism”  and was endorsed when the alliance was grappling with its response to 9/11, the US intervention in Afghanistan, in which several NATO members took an early lead role, and in the context of a changing US national security strategy that placed counterterrorism at its core. The US government was also instituting domestic reforms at this time that influenced the NATO process. In October 2001, the Bush administration signed the Patriot Act into law, which enhanced the government's domestic and foreign surveillance powers, established the National Electronic Crime Task Force, extended government powers to intercept and access electronic communications, and enhanced America's digital forensics capabilities. Perhaps most significantly, the Act included provisions for classifying computer crimes as acts of terrorism for the first time . Further to this, the Bush administration created the Office of Cyberspace Security in the White House and appointed prominent counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, to lead it. The newly created Department for Homeland Security was also given a statutory cyber security role. Tom Ridge, its first Director, highlighted the extent of the US government's concerns at this time: “Terrorists can sit at one computer connected to one network and can create worldwide havoc. [They] don't necessarily need a bomb or explosives to cripple a\nsector of the economy or shut down a power grid” (2003 cited Weimann 2004). This may have been an example of cyber security hyperbole, but the fear created by 9/11 and the prospect of terrorist groups developing sophisticated cyber attack capabilities were significant drivers of the US government's response to cyber security issues in the early post-9/11 period and influenced NATO's growing role in this area of policy.\nThe NATO summit in Riga in 2006 further endorsed the need to continue efforts to enhance NATO's cyber security and emphasis was placed on securing NATO's own information systems against cyber attack . Arguably, however, a broader NATO role in the cyber security of its members was still on the backburner. The 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, however, elevated the issue of cyber security within the alliance and shifted NATO's focus away from cyber terrorism to a focus on the threats posed by nation states and state-sponsored hackers. The attacks were thought to be a response to the removal of a monument to the Soviet liberation of Estonia, and took place over a sustained period of three weeks. All of the Estonian government's websites were shut down, along with the sites of two major banks, a number of political parties and three of the country's biggest news media organisations. From a strategic point of view, the attacks demonstrated a number of the problems outlined in the previous section, particularly the issue of attribution. The Estonian government accused the Russian government of instigating the attacks and saw Russia's refusal to participate in official investigations as confirming a level of culpability . NATO officials strongly suspected Russian state involvement, but found no direct evidence of a link. One NATO spokesperson said, “I won't point fingers. But these were not things done by a few individuals. This clearly bore the hallmarks of something concerted” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). The Estonian attacks also prompted a vigorous and prolonged internal debate within the alliance as to whether a cyber attack could form the basis of an Article 5 commitment. Estonia's defence Minister acknowledged that,“At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country. (2007 cited Traynor 2007)”\nHowever, the sustained cyber assault was widely viewed as a violation of Estonia's sovereignty and even an encroachment on its territorial integrity. As Linnar Viik, a consultant to the Estonian government, asserted, “... this is not some virtual world. This is part of our independence. And these attacks were an attempt to take one country back to the cave, back to the Stone Age” (2007 cited Finn 2007). Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip asked, “What's the difference between a blockade of harbours or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government institutions and newspaper websites?” (2007 cited Rid 2012b). NATO also recognised the severity of the problem, with one Brussels-based official stating: “This is an operational security issue, something we're taking very seriously. It goes to the heart of the alliance's modus operandi” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). In 2007, however, NATO was some way from establishing whether cyber attacks constituted an “armed attack” as stipulated in Article 5, and implementing a collective response to the attacks was problematic given the difficulty of attribution. Nevertheless, the incident formed the basis of a more unified alliance approach to cyber security and the development of enhanced capabilities .\nThe cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007 were not an isolated example of the evolving cyber threat. A number of other serious incidents raised the profile of cyber\nsecurity within NATO member states in late 2007 and 2008 and fuelled attention to strategic vulnerabilities within the transatlantic community. In August 2007, it was reported that Chinese hackers had broken into the networks of the German Chancellery and three other Berlin Ministries, and in November 2007 British intelligence agency MI5 stated that the PLA had been conducting a concerted campaign of cyber espionage against British businesses. In June 2008, Lithuania faced a barrage of cyber attacks after it vetoed an EU energy partnership deal with Russia. The Russian war against Georgia in August 2008 also featured Russian-based hackers using cyber attacks as a precursor to the invasion in order to create confusion among Georgian military units and government ministries and to prevent a coordinated response to the assault . Lastly, in November 2008, the US Pentagon issued a ban on all external hard drives after a USB drive was used by a foreign intelligence agency to upload spyware and data exfiltration software to Defence Department computers .\nThis growth in malicious cyber activity in 2007--2008 created a window of opportunity to develop multilateral mechanisms to respond to cyber security threats and various such measures were put in place over the course of 2008. In January that year, as a direct result of the Estonia attacks, NATO members endorsed a new Cyber Defence Policy, and in March the North Atlantic Council (NAC) established the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA). The CDMA aimed to integrate the alliance's cyber security functions and provide support for NATO members in the event of cyber attacks. A NATO spokesperson described the role of the centre as, “defence, whether an attack comes from state, criminal or other sources” (2008 cited Grant 2008). Later in 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was established in Tallinn, Estonia. While not part of the formal NATO command structure, the centre has taken a role in advancing NATO cyber security doctrine policy and developing cyber security capabilities. It has also helped to reduce alliance-wide transaction costs through the NATO “Smart Defence” initiative. Wallander (2000) has explained how highly institutionalised alliances like NATO create “assets” which help to sustain the alliance even as the security environment changes. The formation of these bodies should be seen in this context. They have provided mechanisms for the pooling of resources, avenues for negotiations between NATO members on cyber issues, enhanced decision-making within the alliance, and created incentives for all members to develop multilateral approaches to cyber security rather than isolated national ones.\nThe next major institutional development for NATO was the inclusion of cyber security in the November 2010 Strategic Concept, the third such Concept to be released in the post-cold war era. This was another important milestone for the alliance and a firm indication that NATO members considered cyber security to be an important area of focus. The concept emphasised “the next phase in NATO's evolution” and the need for “continuous reform” to meet modern security challenges . On cyber security specifically, it stated that cyber attacks were not just a national problem, but a collective threat to the “prosperity, security, and stability” of the whole of the Euro Atlantic area, recognising that such attacks were becoming, “more frequent, more organised and more costly in the damage that they inflict on government administrations, businesses, economies and potentially also transportation and supply networks and other critical infrastructure” . Interestingly, while the concept made reference to NATO's “ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyber-attacks” , the notion of deterrence was notably absent.\nNATO's institutional adaption to the threat of cyber attacks continued with the adoption of a revised Cyber Defence Policy in 2011, which placed emphasis on minimum\nrequirements for cyber defence of national networks and an integrated system of cyber governance within NATO, with the North Atlantic Council as the ultimate driver of NATO policy and cooperation in this area. The revised policy was another landmark in NATO's strategic thinking on cyber security, highlighted the need for pragmatic responses to cyber attacks (not being constrained by Article 5, for example), and recognised the importance of prevention of and resilience to attacks . The establishment of a Rapid Reaction Team in 2012 was also noteworthy. A team of six NATO computer experts were tasked with responding to cyber attacks in real time and re-establishing computer network functionality in the event of cyber attacks and/or network exploitation.\nA further notable contribution to NATO's adaptation to cyber security challenges was the publication of The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in March 2013. This document was produced by team of legal and technical experts working in conjunction with the CCD COE and aimed to codify and clarify possible responses to both the legal and strategic dilemmas around cyber attacks by apply existing international law to the cyber security arena. The document has advanced NATO's legal and strategic thinking on key cyber security issues, including on the problem of attribution, where it argues that states should bear some responsibility for cyber attacks emanating from within their jurisdiction. There are areas, however, that are underexplored in the document, including legal prohibitions on attacks that do not constitute a use of armed force and which take place outside of armed conflict (which still constitute the vast majority of cyber attacks), and kinetic-to-cyber operations, where conventional force might be used to destroy digital infrastructure .\nFinally, in September 2014, at its summit in Cardiff, NATO members endorsed the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy. In many ways, this was the culmination of the policy debate that was started within NATO by the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As a result of the policy, NATO will consider (and potentially implement) a collective Article 5 response to cyber attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. This landmark in NATO's cyber security evolution is not without its problems. Uncertainty remains as to how a collective response can be implemented when attribution is problematic, and it is not clear what threshold a cyber attack would need to meet to trigger an Article 5 response. Minor intrusions into NATO networks are clearly not what NATO policy-makers have in mind. However, cyber attacks with a severe impact on the economy, critical infrastructure and national security of NATO members may well fall into this category. As Jamie Shea, head of NATO's Emerging Security Challenges division, has stated: “We are keeping that ambiguous so a potential aggressor does not get the idea they can carry out cyber attacks up to a certain level with impunity” (2014 cited Washford 2014). It is also unclear what a collective cyber response by NATO would actually look like. NATO does not have the authority to implement sanctions against states for cyber attacks; digital retaliation is difficult although not impossible, as can be seen in the case of the (still unclaimed) attacks against North Korea in response to the Sony hack; and an attack using conventional force, which has not been ruled out, would clearly need to be proportional to the original offence. Nevertheless, 15 years after NATO first experienced cyber attacks, the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy had brought cyber security firmly inside the purview of NATO's evolving responsibilities. It has indicated that the alliance will respond deliberately and proportionally to any significant attack depending on the extent of the damage, the level of attribution, and the motives and identity of the attackers  (Table 2).\nDefence Studies 309\n# NATO's cyber security doctrine\nAlthough this institutional change has occurred incrementally, and has been driven by a diverse set of events and actors, cyber security appears to have found a foothold in NATO's doctrine for the defence of its members and for the general employment of NATO power in the post-cold war era. But what do these institutional developments tell us about NATO's collective cyber security doctrine? How do these capabilities, policies and institutions actually shape how NATO acts in cyberspace, and do they constitute a unified or uniform approach to cyber security across the transatlantic region?\nNATO's first priority has always been to defend the North Atlantic area, and, even though cyber threats emanate from cyberspace, the alliance's doctrine is still, for the most part, focused on the protection of its own computer networks. NATO's cyber command is centrally located in Brussels, where the CDMA and NCIRC provide coordination, real-time monitoring capabilities and intelligence sharing functions , and alliance officials are aware of the need to protect NATO's digital infrastructure spread across its many international sites. While NATO has taken a broader role in cyber defence as a result of the recent adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, its own operational security is paramount.\nSecond, NATO's cyber security doctrine and posture is still largely defensive. The alliance has not been involved in developing offensive cyber attack capabilities. These sorts of capabilities remain the purview of the national intelligence and security institutions of individual members. It may be that NATO's political and military command would be informed if a NATO member was involved in conducting offensive cyber security operations, especially if it was part of a wider NATO mission, but at the present time NATO's cyber command is not envisaged as having such a role.\nThird, although deterring cyber attacks is clearly not as straight forward as deterring conventional attacks from state actors, NATO cyber doctrine appears to be based in deterrence by denial. Given the difficulty of retaliating against cyber attackers and the inability to compel attackers to desist from attacks, denying them the ability to achieve their objectives has become the focus. NATO will make it as difficult as possible to infiltrate its systems and make sure hackers are aware that they are unlikely to be able to achieve their intended effects (Healey and van Bochoven 2012). Jamie Shea has recently highlighted the utility of this defensive posture .\nTable 2. The institutional development of NATO's cyber security role.\n|  1999 | Cyber attacks directed against NATO during the Kosovo conflict  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  2002 | Prague summit – Cyber security appears on NATO’s formal agenda for the first time.

While NATO has clearly been influenced by the diffusion of power and influence away from the state in the post-cold war era, and particularly threats from terrorist groups and non-affiliated hackers, concerns about Russia and China have contributed to a revised sense of state adversaries during this period. Despite NATO's preponderance of power in other areas, its strategic rivals have proved highly capable in the cyber security arena. General Keith Alexander, head of the US Cyber Command, has described Russia as a “near peer” in terms of its cyber capabilities (2010 cited Giles 2011) and Giles (2011, p. 54) has argued both China's and Russia's emphasis on semi-autonomous agencies in cyber security operations gives them a distinct advantage over the US and its allies. Russian and Chinese-based hackers have regularly targeted NATO's networks in response to political disputes, most recently in response to NATO's stance on the Ukraine crisis , and both countries have an interest in exfiltrating the confidential, operational, strategic and political information that flows through NATO networks. Although some attempts have been made to enhance cyber security cooperation between NATO and Russia, such as dialogue at the NATO-Russia Council level , the Russian annexation of Crimea and on-going efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine, which have taken place alongside new cyber attacks against NATO members, have put any meaningful cooperation on cyber issues on hold. The US Justice Department's indictment of five member of the PLA in May 2014 has similarly stalled any attempt to cooperate with China on cyber issues .\nLastly, as with many other areas of NATO's security doctrine, NATO's approach to cyber security is based around developing cooperative relationships, both internally and externally. NATO has developed a range of formal partnerships in the post-cold war era that are increasingly addressing cyber security issues, including the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI), the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). Cyber Security is increasingly a component of the Individual Partnership Action Plans (IPAPs) negotiated with countries around the world, such as New Zealand, and NATO has developed enhanced links with the private sector and critical infrastructure providers in advancing cyber defence in the North Atlantic area . These diverse networks of partnerships allow for global cooperation on cyber security issues and help to develop cyber security norms, standards and capabilities. In this respect, NATO's cyber security doctrine covers and is part of each of its three main operational pillars: Crisis Management (e.g. the crisis surrounding the cyber attacks against Estonian in 2007), Collective Defence (e.g. the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy) and Cooperative Security.\n## A transatlantic divide?\nNATO has frequently been beset by intra-alliance tensions and in the cyber security arena there appears to be at least some evidence of a divergence in European and US policy approaches. Recent revelations by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, for example, have exposed transatlantic tensions around surveillance, and the alleged NSA hacking of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, which led to an angry phone call between Obama and Merkel and the summoning of the US Ambassador to Germany, was a major embarrassment for the US government . The US has arguably taken a harder security stance on cyber issues since 9/11 because of its desire to protect the US homeland, and because it faces increased strategic rivalry from rival global\npower centres. A more aggressive cyber posture can certainly be seen in the establishment of the US Cyber Command, a unified and expanding military command structure tasked with coordinating defensive and offensive cyber operations for all branches of the US military, the deployment of the Stuxnet software against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the Patriot Act, and the mass surveillance programmes run by the NSA, including the Prism programme. The use of offensive and even pre-emptive operations by the US government has also grown in recent years, with a high number of ICT specialists employed to penetrate foreign networks . In 2012, Obama signed Presidential Decision Directive 20, a classified document that gave the US military the authority to conduct more aggressive cyber operations to thwart cyber attacks against US systems .\nThe wealth of cyber resources and capabilities that exist within the US military and associated agencies may be a reason in and of itself why the US approach to managing cyber conflict has been dominated by that branch of the US government. Mary O Connell takes up this line of argument, suggesting that the US government has become “trapped in an ideology of militarism”  and claiming that “the US military today has the largest concentration of expertise and legal authority with respect to cyberspace” . She further notes that in 2009, following the Estonia attacks, the Russia Georgia war and the release of the Stuxnet virus, the US government “began releasing a number of policies on cyber security that were predominantly military in orientation” . This would seem to support the line of argument advanced by this article, that threats from state rather than non-state actors explain the elevation of cyber security as an issue within the transatlantic security community.\nThis hard power approach to cyber security in the US could also be explained by the rhetoric being used to describe cyber attacks in the American context. Former Defence Secretary Leon Panetta's claim that the US could face a “cyber Pearl Harbour” is a prime example of the securitisation and militarisation of cyber discourse. When there is a propensity at the highest levels of government to adopt Second World War and cold war analogies to characterise cyber conflict, this can shape US policy and doctrine in a certain direction. Shachtman and Singer (2011) argue that clear links can be found between cold war strategic thinking and the formulation of current US policy, especially the idea that cyber attacks might be met with conventional attacks; an idea “lifted” from the 1960s strategy of flexible response. Commercial and political motives might also have led to the US taking a more military-based approach to cyber security issues. They further argue that “there is a massive amount of threat inflation going on in Washington's discussion of online dangers, most frequently by those with political or profit motives in hyping the threats” Shachtman and Singer (2011). While we should be careful in suggesting that a new “cyber industrial complex” is forming in America, the huge US government spending on cyber protection for the federal government, such as a $1 billion contract awarded to Raytheon by the Department for Homeland Security in 2015, may create incentives for responses to cyber security threats to be militarised. Equally, threat inflation may displace attention from the arguably more pervasive problem of cyber crime.\nIn Europe, at least on the surface, a softer cyber security approach is evident. EU responses to cyber security have typically emphasised criminal and civil procedures for dealing with cyber attacks, reflecting a European preference for soft power over hard power, and there has been a broader reluctance in Europe to militarise cyberspace. The new European Union Cyber Security Strategy, for example, is based on promoting\nnorms in cyberspace, encouraging dialogue between nations, enhancing technical capacity and resilience, and fighting cybercrime . The most controversial aspect has been the requirement for businesses in Europe, and particularly critical infrastructure providers, to report cyber attacks to a central authority. Overall though, the strategy is defensively orientated and non-militaristic.\nThe level of transatlantic divergence on cyber security issues should not be overstated, however. Given the impact of 9/11 on the US national security establishment, it is not surprising that the balance in America has tilted towards security over privacy in the decade or so since the attacks. In the context of the rise of China, the US pivot to Asia and an increasingly assertive Russia, the US is also bound to have an interest in staying ahead of its state competitors in cyber space. The US has shown some restraint in the use of its cyber capabilities and a recognisable commitment to the emergence of normative constraints on cyber warfare. Offensive cyber attacks were considered by the Obama administration as part of the campaign against Colonel Gadhafi's Libya in 2011, but a reluctance to set a dangerous precedent in how wars are fought, as well as a degree of concern over securing Congressional support for such strategy, meant that the campaign was limited to conventional capabilities . The Obama administration has also announced plans to end mass surveillance programmes and has stated that the US will cease monitoring the personal communications of European leaders.\nWithin Europe there are also certain states that are moving closer to the US in developing harder cyber security capabilities, and doing so outside of the NATO framework. The UK government, for example, has taken steps to merge cyber security intelligence and military operations, and the French and German militaries are both developing offensive cyber capabilities . As previously stated, while there has been no NATO-led process for offensive cyber security, NATO's leading powers, including the US, are pursuing similar strategies domestically.\nCommon interests, values and threats also continue to bind American and European approaches to cyber security together. Both sides of the Atlantic advocate an open and accessible global cyber commons with minimal government restrictions, and an open internet is seen by both sides as central to driving economic growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Americans and Europeans are also unified in their approach to fighting cyber crime and securing critical infrastructure . This general approach stands in opposition to Russia and China, who are arguably more concerned with being able to control information that could destabilise their societies and who have argued for international rights to restrict and censor internet traffic on that basis . While this divide may be hindering wider international cooperation, it is evidence of a level of unity on the basic issues within the transatlantic area.\nIntra-alliance management of cyber security issues also remains an important area of focus for the NATO allies, not least because some NATO members are clearly more concerned about cyber security than others. Estonia, the NATO member victim to the most significant attacks on its critical infrastructure, does not have the same level of cyber security concerns as Portugal, for example. But this is not necessarily an impediment to a NATO cyber security role, especially as NATO members have tended to specialise and develop niche capabilities that benefit the wider membership. Perhaps now more than ever NATO's capability aggregation role -- amassing capabilities against a common threat -- and its role in facilitating “smart defence”, are of crucial importance . Former Secretary General Rasmussen emphasised this himself in 2011, saying that “Smart defence is about building security for less money by working\ntogether and being more flexible” . In an environment where NATO members' defence budgets are under strain, and where the US is concerned about a lack of European Defence spending, specialisation within the alliance will be increasingly important. NATO's Cyber Security Centre of Excellence is an example of this concept in practice, where some NATO members (Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Spain) have invested in a valuable institutional resource that is beneficial to all members. Defence cooperation creates efficiencies and lowers transaction costs; this is being achieved through NATO's institutional frameworks and potentially lowering the scope for intra-alliance divides.\n## Conclusion\nWhile NATO has tried to come to terms with some of the strategic challenges involved in enhancing the cyber security of its members, there are still some unresolved and perhaps unresolvable cyber security issues. Reliably attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, responding to the diversity of actors involved and deterring cyber attacks, for example, will continue to be difficult and possibly intractable problems. NATO appears so far to have accepted this and adopted a cyber security posture that is pragmatic and deals with attacks on a case by case basis. Its defensive role, based around deterrence by denial, is appropriate given the reluctance to use the alliance for offensive cyber purposes, and its focus is in areas where it has a clear and compelling political and strategic interest; in cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and cyber warfare.\nThe defence of NATO's own digital networks continues to be of paramount importance. However, there is some evidence that the alliance is taking a wider and deeper role in cyber security in the North Atlantic area. The adoption of an Article 5 approach to cyber attacks is foremost in this regard, but the efforts that have been made to forge private sector partnerships and to develop normative and legal mechanisms for cyber security are also significant. Ultimately, cyber security remains a national responsibility for NATO members.\nWhat is perhaps most remarkable about how NATO has adapted to cyber security challenges is the institutional capacity the alliance has put in place. This institutional development has been driven mostly by external threats, from terrorist groups initially, but most recently by state actors, and these have accelerated the political and institutional focus on cyber security within the alliance. The alliance's integrated military command has always been one of its most important institutional assets and has historically allowed NATO members to coordinate military operations. The political integration and coordination provided by the North Atlantic Council has also been noteworthy throughout alliance history. In a similar vein, NATO now has a common cyber security capacity through which members can coordinate responses to cyber security incidents and provide channels of communication that are likely to continue to be important as cyber threats evolve.\nTransatlantic tensions on cyber security issues are certainly in evidence, and these stem from broader tensions between the US and Europe over the response to 9/11 and the role of the internet in surveillance. Despite this, there is a considerable degree of unity on the core cyber security challenges within the NATO membership. The balance between privacy and security will continue to be debated within NATO member states, but at this stage, this does not appear to be inhibiting a common and unified approach to at least defensive cyber operations. Whether NATO will take on an offensive cyber security posture at some stage will be an issue to monitor. The requirements of\nimplementing an Article 5 response to a major cyber attack might provide momentum for the development of offensive capabilities to be deployed as part of a unified NATO command, but it is more likely that NATO's most prominent players will continue to develop and deploy these kinds of capabilities outside of NATO channels.\nFinally, it is worth returning to NATO's core functions: collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. In all these areas, a NATO cyber security role would appear to have considerable merit. Global security challenges invariably require multilateral solutions and NATO has a range of adaptable institutional capabilities that are reasonably well suited to the task at hand.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

    "## NATO's institutional adaptation": "Explanations of NATO's evolving post-cold war role can be divided into three main theoretical camps. Realist and neorealist scholars have emphasised the continuity of external threats and have viewed the perpetuation of NATO as being based on the US desire to control and influence European members of the alliance . Institutionalist scholars have emphasised the adaptability of NATO to new security challenges and emphasised such concepts as path dependence and institutional “stickiness” as explaining NATO's perpetuation, which is to say that the adaptation of NATO structures has been seen as preferable to the reinvention/reestablishment of the alliance . Constructivist scholars have focused more on NATO's common identity as a community of democracies and the desire to expand that community to Central and Eastern Europe . Arguably, all three of these approaches are of utility in expanding NATO's emerging cyber security role. NATO members have consistently emphasised the threat from cyber attacks, and that the threat comes from state and state-supported actors (realism); there has been a concerted effort to adapt NATO's institutions, operations and doctrines to respond to cyber attacks (institutionalism); and cyber attacks cannot be separated from identity politics, even when the identity of cyber attackers is hard to establish (constructivism).\nThis section of the article combines insights from realist and institutional approaches to alliance transformation and argues that cyber threats have driven institutional change within NATO. In this respect, NATO has been under pressure to adjust its functions and design to deal with changing environmental demands . This process of evolution has taken place slowly and incrementally and has been only one facet of a broader adaptation on the part of the alliance to a diversifying and globalising security environment. It should also be noted that institutional adaptation is not a guarantee of effectiveness . Nevertheless, NATO's institutional strength and adaptability has made it a useful tool for dialogue, policy development and decision-making on cyber security within the Euro Atlantic area, and created opportunities for developing unified positions on the core issues.\nMore specifically, there appear to have been four drivers of this process of institutional evolution. First, NATO has taken steps to enhance its cyber security due to its operational experiences, including in Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan from 2003 and Libya in 2011. These conflicts have taken on a cyber dimension and NATO has had to incorporate cyber into strategic planning as a result. Second, the events of 9/11 created serious concerns within NATO over cyber terrorism (and terrorist use of the internet more broadly) and this has driven NATO's cyber security focus. Third, geostrategic rivalries with Russia and China have taken on an increasingly online dimension and NATO has responded accordingly. Fourth, the volume and severity of cyber attacks against NATO itself and its members has increased rapidly in the last decade. These changing dynamics have given NATO's political leaders incentives to enhance NATO's cyber security capabilities and created “triggers” for institutional change .\nCyber security first appeared on NATO's formal agenda at the 2002 Prague Summit, where NATO members committed to the “Initiation of measures to strengthen defence against cyber attacks” . This new focus stemmed from the conflict in Kosovo in 1999, where pro-Serbian hackers had targeted NATO communications infrastructure with a view to affecting its war fighting capabilities. A NATO website responsible for promoting NATO's role in the conflict was subjected to sustained DDoS attacks from Serbian hackers, and Chinese hackers targeted NATO members in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, leading to the White House website being taken offline for three days . The summit highlighted NATO's “ability to adjust to new priorities and to adapt its capabilities in order to meet new challenges” . This process of change was described as part of an “evolution” and was to occur “incrementally”, “on a continual and deliberate basis” . In a more concrete sense, the 2002 summit established an institutional capacity to respond to this growing concern. A NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) was formed and the NATO Cyber Defence Programme was established.\nNATO also took on a more active role in the fight against terrorism at this time. . The new commitment to cyber defence at the Prague summit was referred to as being part of a “package of measures ... to strengthen NATO's capabilities to defend against terrorism”  and was endorsed when the alliance was grappling with its response to 9/11, the US intervention in Afghanistan, in which several NATO members took an early lead role, and in the context of a changing US national security strategy that placed counterterrorism at its core. The US government was also instituting domestic reforms at this time that influenced the NATO process. In October 2001, the Bush administration signed the Patriot Act into law, which enhanced the government's domestic and foreign surveillance powers, established the National Electronic Crime Task Force, extended government powers to intercept and access electronic communications, and enhanced America's digital forensics capabilities. Perhaps most significantly, the Act included provisions for classifying computer crimes as acts of terrorism for the first time . Further to this, the Bush administration created the Office of Cyberspace Security in the White House and appointed prominent counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, to lead it. The newly created Department for Homeland Security was also given a statutory cyber security role. Tom Ridge, its first Director, highlighted the extent of the US government's concerns at this time: “Terrorists can sit at one computer connected to one network and can create worldwide havoc. [They] don't necessarily need a bomb or explosives to cripple a\nsector of the economy or shut down a power grid” (2003 cited Weimann 2004). This may have been an example of cyber security hyperbole, but the fear created by 9/11 and the prospect of terrorist groups developing sophisticated cyber attack capabilities were significant drivers of the US government's response to cyber security issues in the early post-9/11 period and influenced NATO's growing role in this area of policy.\nThe NATO summit in Riga in 2006 further endorsed the need to continue efforts to enhance NATO's cyber security and emphasis was placed on securing NATO's own information systems against cyber attack . Arguably, however, a broader NATO role in the cyber security of its members was still on the backburner. The 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, however, elevated the issue of cyber security within the alliance and shifted NATO's focus away from cyber terrorism to a focus on the threats posed by nation states and state-sponsored hackers. The attacks were thought to be a response to the removal of a monument to the Soviet liberation of Estonia, and took place over a sustained period of three weeks. All of the Estonian government's websites were shut down, along with the sites of two major banks, a number of political parties and three of the country's biggest news media organisations. From a strategic point of view, the attacks demonstrated a number of the problems outlined in the previous section, particularly the issue of attribution. The Estonian government accused the Russian government of instigating the attacks and saw Russia's refusal to participate in official investigations as confirming a level of culpability . NATO officials strongly suspected Russian state involvement, but found no direct evidence of a link. One NATO spokesperson said, “I won't point fingers. But these were not things done by a few individuals. This clearly bore the hallmarks of something concerted” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). The Estonian attacks also prompted a vigorous and prolonged internal debate within the alliance as to whether a cyber attack could form the basis of an Article 5 commitment. Estonia's defence Minister acknowledged that,“At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country. (2007 cited Traynor 2007)”\nHowever, the sustained cyber assault was widely viewed as a violation of Estonia's sovereignty and even an encroachment on its territorial integrity. As Linnar Viik, a consultant to the Estonian government, asserted, “... this is not some virtual world. This is part of our independence. And these attacks were an attempt to take one country back to the cave, back to the Stone Age” (2007 cited Finn 2007). Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip asked, “What's the difference between a blockade of harbours or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government institutions and newspaper websites?” (2007 cited Rid 2012b). NATO also recognised the severity of the problem, with one Brussels-based official stating: “This is an operational security issue, something we're taking very seriously. It goes to the heart of the alliance's modus operandi” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). In 2007, however, NATO was some way from establishing whether cyber attacks constituted an “armed attack” as stipulated in Article 5, and implementing a collective response to the attacks was problematic given the difficulty of attribution. Nevertheless, the incident formed the basis of a more unified alliance approach to cyber security and the development of enhanced capabilities .\nThe cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007 were not an isolated example of the evolving cyber threat. A number of other serious incidents raised the profile of cyber\nsecurity within NATO member states in late 2007 and 2008 and fuelled attention to strategic vulnerabilities within the transatlantic community. In August 2007, it was reported that Chinese hackers had broken into the networks of the German Chancellery and three other Berlin Ministries, and in November 2007 British intelligence agency MI5 stated that the PLA had been conducting a concerted campaign of cyber espionage against British businesses. In June 2008, Lithuania faced a barrage of cyber attacks after it vetoed an EU energy partnership deal with Russia. The Russian war against Georgia in August 2008 also featured Russian-based hackers using cyber attacks as a precursor to the invasion in order to create confusion among Georgian military units and government ministries and to prevent a coordinated response to the assault . Lastly, in November 2008, the US Pentagon issued a ban on all external hard drives after a USB drive was used by a foreign intelligence agency to upload spyware and data exfiltration software to Defence Department computers .\nThis growth in malicious cyber activity in 2007--2008 created a window of opportunity to develop multilateral mechanisms to respond to cyber security threats and various such measures were put in place over the course of 2008. In January that year, as a direct result of the Estonia attacks, NATO members endorsed a new Cyber Defence Policy, and in March the North Atlantic Council (NAC) established the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA). The CDMA aimed to integrate the alliance's cyber security functions and provide support for NATO members in the event of cyber attacks. A NATO spokesperson described the role of the centre as, “defence, whether an attack comes from state, criminal or other sources” (2008 cited Grant 2008). Later in 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was established in Tallinn, Estonia. While not part of the formal NATO command structure, the centre has taken a role in advancing NATO cyber security doctrine policy and developing cyber security capabilities. It has also helped to reduce alliance-wide transaction costs through the NATO “Smart Defence” initiative. Wallander (2000) has explained how highly institutionalised alliances like NATO create “assets” which help to sustain the alliance even as the security environment changes. The formation of these bodies should be seen in this context. They have provided mechanisms for the pooling of resources, avenues for negotiations between NATO members on cyber issues, enhanced decision-making within the alliance, and created incentives for all members to develop multilateral approaches to cyber security rather than isolated national ones.\nThe next major institutional development for NATO was the inclusion of cyber security in the November 2010 Strategic Concept, the third such Concept to be released in the post-cold war era. This was another important milestone for the alliance and a firm indication that NATO members considered cyber security to be an important area of focus. The concept emphasised “the next phase in NATO's evolution” and the need for “continuous reform” to meet modern security challenges . On cyber security specifically, it stated that cyber attacks were not just a national problem, but a collective threat to the “prosperity, security, and stability” of the whole of the Euro Atlantic area, recognising that such attacks were becoming, “more frequent, more organised and more costly in the damage that they inflict on government administrations, businesses, economies and potentially also transportation and supply networks and other critical infrastructure” . Interestingly, while the concept made reference to NATO's “ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyber-attacks” , the notion of deterrence was notably absent.\nNATO's institutional adaption to the threat of cyber attacks continued with the adoption of a revised Cyber Defence Policy in 2011, which placed emphasis on minimum\nrequirements for cyber defence of national networks and an integrated system of cyber governance within NATO, with the North Atlantic Council as the ultimate driver of NATO policy and cooperation in this area. The revised policy was another landmark in NATO's strategic thinking on cyber security, highlighted the need for pragmatic responses to cyber attacks (not being constrained by Article 5, for example), and recognised the importance of prevention of and resilience to attacks . The establishment of a Rapid Reaction Team in 2012 was also noteworthy. A team of six NATO computer experts were tasked with responding to cyber attacks in real time and re-establishing computer network functionality in the event of cyber attacks and/or network exploitation.\nA further notable contribution to NATO's adaptation to cyber security challenges was the publication of The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in March 2013. This document was produced by team of legal and technical experts working in conjunction with the CCD COE and aimed to codify and clarify possible responses to both the legal and strategic dilemmas around cyber attacks by apply existing international law to the cyber security arena. The document has advanced NATO's legal and strategic thinking on key cyber security issues, including on the problem of attribution, where it argues that states should bear some responsibility for cyber attacks emanating from within their jurisdiction. There are areas, however, that are underexplored in the document, including legal prohibitions on attacks that do not constitute a use of armed force and which take place outside of armed conflict (which still constitute the vast majority of cyber attacks), and kinetic-to-cyber operations, where conventional force might be used to destroy digital infrastructure .\nFinally, in September 2014, at its summit in Cardiff, NATO members endorsed the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy. In many ways, this was the culmination of the policy debate that was started within NATO by the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As a result of the policy, NATO will consider (and potentially implement) a collective Article 5 response to cyber attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. This landmark in NATO's cyber security evolution is not without its problems. Uncertainty remains as to how a collective response can be implemented when attribution is problematic, and it is not clear what threshold a cyber attack would need to meet to trigger an Article 5 response. Minor intrusions into NATO networks are clearly not what NATO policy-makers have in mind. However, cyber attacks with a severe impact on the economy, critical infrastructure and national security of NATO members may well fall into this category. As Jamie Shea, head of NATO's Emerging Security Challenges division, has stated: “We are keeping that ambiguous so a potential aggressor does not get the idea they can carry out cyber attacks up to a certain level with impunity” (2014 cited Washford 2014). It is also unclear what a collective cyber response by NATO would actually look like. NATO does not have the authority to implement sanctions against states for cyber attacks; digital retaliation is difficult although not impossible, as can be seen in the case of the (still unclaimed) attacks against North Korea in response to the Sony hack; and an attack using conventional force, which has not been ruled out, would clearly need to be proportional to the original offence. Nevertheless, 15 years after NATO first experienced cyber attacks, the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy had brought cyber security firmly inside the purview of NATO's evolving responsibilities. It has indicated that the alliance will respond deliberately and proportionally to any significant attack depending on the extent of the damage, the level of attribution, and the motives and identity of the attackers  (Table 2).\nDefence Studies 309\n# NATO's cyber security doctrine\nAlthough this institutional change has occurred incrementally, and has been driven by a diverse set of events and actors, cyber security appears to have found a foothold in NATO's doctrine for the defence of its members and for the general employment of NATO power in the post-cold war era. But what do these institutional developments tell us about NATO's collective cyber security doctrine? How do these capabilities, policies and institutions actually shape how NATO acts in cyberspace, and do they constitute a unified or uniform approach to cyber security across the transatlantic region?\nNATO's first priority has always been to defend the North Atlantic area, and, even though cyber threats emanate from cyberspace, the alliance's doctrine is still, for the most part, focused on the protection of its own computer networks. NATO's cyber command is centrally located in Brussels, where the CDMA and NCIRC provide coordination, real-time monitoring capabilities and intelligence sharing functions , and alliance officials are aware of the need to protect NATO's digital infrastructure spread across its many international sites. While NATO has taken a broader role in cyber defence as a result of the recent adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, its own operational security is paramount.\nSecond, NATO's cyber security doctrine and posture is still largely defensive. The alliance has not been involved in developing offensive cyber attack capabilities. These sorts of capabilities remain the purview of the national intelligence and security institutions of individual members. It may be that NATO's political and military command would be informed if a NATO member was involved in conducting offensive cyber security operations, especially if it was part of a wider NATO mission, but at the present time NATO's cyber command is not envisaged as having such a role.\nThird, although deterring cyber attacks is clearly not as straight forward as deterring conventional attacks from state actors, NATO cyber doctrine appears to be based in deterrence by denial. Given the difficulty of retaliating against cyber attackers and the inability to compel attackers to desist from attacks, denying them the ability to achieve their objectives has become the focus. NATO will make it as difficult as possible to infiltrate its systems and make sure hackers are aware that they are unlikely to be able to achieve their intended effects (Healey and van Bochoven 2012). Jamie Shea has recently highlighted the utility of this defensive posture .\nTable 2.

While NATO has clearly been influenced by the diffusion of power and influence away from the state in the post-cold war era, and particularly threats from terrorist groups and non-affiliated hackers, concerns about Russia and China have contributed to a revised sense of state adversaries during this period. Despite NATO's preponderance of power in other areas, its strategic rivals have proved highly capable in the cyber security arena. General Keith Alexander, head of the US Cyber Command, has described Russia as a “near peer” in terms of its cyber capabilities (2010 cited Giles 2011) and Giles (2011, p. 54) has argued both China's and Russia's emphasis on semi-autonomous agencies in cyber security operations gives them a distinct advantage over the US and its allies. Russian and Chinese-based hackers have regularly targeted NATO's networks in response to political disputes, most recently in response to NATO's stance on the Ukraine crisis , and both countries have an interest in exfiltrating the confidential, operational, strategic and political information that flows through NATO networks. Although some attempts have been made to enhance cyber security cooperation between NATO and Russia, such as dialogue at the NATO-Russia Council level , the Russian annexation of Crimea and on-going efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine, which have taken place alongside new cyber attacks against NATO members, have put any meaningful cooperation on cyber issues on hold. The US Justice Department's indictment of five member of the PLA in May 2014 has similarly stalled any attempt to cooperate with China on cyber issues .\nLastly, as with many other areas of NATO's security doctrine, NATO's approach to cyber security is based around developing cooperative relationships, both internally and externally. NATO has developed a range of formal partnerships in the post-cold war era that are increasingly addressing cyber security issues, including the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI), the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). Cyber Security is increasingly a component of the Individual Partnership Action Plans (IPAPs) negotiated with countries around the world, such as New Zealand, and NATO has developed enhanced links with the private sector and critical infrastructure providers in advancing cyber defence in the North Atlantic area . These diverse networks of partnerships allow for global cooperation on cyber security issues and help to develop cyber security norms, standards and capabilities. In this respect, NATO's cyber security doctrine covers and is part of each of its three main operational pillars: Crisis Management (e.g. the crisis surrounding the cyber attacks against Estonian in 2007), Collective Defence (e.g. the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy) and Cooperative Security.",
    "## A transatlantic divide?": "NATO has frequently been beset by intra-alliance tensions and in the cyber security arena there appears to be at least some evidence of a divergence in European and US policy approaches. Recent revelations by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, for example, have exposed transatlantic tensions around surveillance, and the alleged NSA hacking of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, which led to an angry phone call between Obama and Merkel and the summoning of the US Ambassador to Germany, was a major embarrassment for the US government . The US has arguably taken a harder security stance on cyber issues since 9/11 because of its desire to protect the US homeland, and because it faces increased strategic rivalry from rival global\npower centres. A more aggressive cyber posture can certainly be seen in the establishment of the US Cyber Command, a unified and expanding military command structure tasked with coordinating defensive and offensive cyber operations for all branches of the US military, the deployment of the Stuxnet software against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the Patriot Act, and the mass surveillance programmes run by the NSA, including the Prism programme. The use of offensive and even pre-emptive operations by the US government has also grown in recent years, with a high number of ICT specialists employed to penetrate foreign networks . In 2012, Obama signed Presidential Decision Directive 20, a classified document that gave the US military the authority to conduct more aggressive cyber operations to thwart cyber attacks against US systems .\nThe wealth of cyber resources and capabilities that exist within the US military and associated agencies may be a reason in and of itself why the US approach to managing cyber conflict has been dominated by that branch of the US government. Mary O Connell takes up this line of argument, suggesting that the US government has become “trapped in an ideology of militarism”  and claiming that “the US military today has the largest concentration of expertise and legal authority with respect to cyberspace” . She further notes that in 2009, following the Estonia attacks, the Russia Georgia war and the release of the Stuxnet virus, the US government “began releasing a number of policies on cyber security that were predominantly military in orientation” . This would seem to support the line of argument advanced by this article, that threats from state rather than non-state actors explain the elevation of cyber security as an issue within the transatlantic security community.\nThis hard power approach to cyber security in the US could also be explained by the rhetoric being used to describe cyber attacks in the American context. Former Defence Secretary Leon Panetta's claim that the US could face a “cyber Pearl Harbour” is a prime example of the securitisation and militarisation of cyber discourse. When there is a propensity at the highest levels of government to adopt Second World War and cold war analogies to characterise cyber conflict, this can shape US policy and doctrine in a certain direction. Shachtman and Singer (2011) argue that clear links can be found between cold war strategic thinking and the formulation of current US policy, especially the idea that cyber attacks might be met with conventional attacks; an idea “lifted” from the 1960s strategy of flexible response. Commercial and political motives might also have led to the US taking a more military-based approach to cyber security issues. They further argue that “there is a massive amount of threat inflation going on in Washington's discussion of online dangers, most frequently by those with political or profit motives in hyping the threats” Shachtman and Singer (2011). While we should be careful in suggesting that a new “cyber industrial complex” is forming in America, the huge US government spending on cyber protection for the federal government, such as a $1 billion contract awarded to Raytheon by the Department for Homeland Security in 2015, may create incentives for responses to cyber security threats to be militarised. Equally, threat inflation may displace attention from the arguably more pervasive problem of cyber crime.\nIn Europe, at least on the surface, a softer cyber security approach is evident. EU responses to cyber security have typically emphasised criminal and civil procedures for dealing with cyber attacks, reflecting a European preference for soft power over hard power, and there has been a broader reluctance in Europe to militarise cyberspace. The new European Union Cyber Security Strategy, for example, is based on promoting\nnorms in cyberspace, encouraging dialogue between nations, enhancing technical capacity and resilience, and fighting cybercrime . The most controversial aspect has been the requirement for businesses in Europe, and particularly critical infrastructure providers, to report cyber attacks to a central authority. Overall though, the strategy is defensively orientated and non-militaristic.\nThe level of transatlantic divergence on cyber security issues should not be overstated, however. Given the impact of 9/11 on the US national security establishment, it is not surprising that the balance in America has tilted towards security over privacy in the decade or so since the attacks. In the context of the rise of China, the US pivot to Asia and an increasingly assertive Russia, the US is also bound to have an interest in staying ahead of its state competitors in cyber space. The US has shown some restraint in the use of its cyber capabilities and a recognisable commitment to the emergence of normative constraints on cyber warfare. Offensive cyber attacks were considered by the Obama administration as part of the campaign against Colonel Gadhafi's Libya in 2011, but a reluctance to set a dangerous precedent in how wars are fought, as well as a degree of concern over securing Congressional support for such strategy, meant that the campaign was limited to conventional capabilities . The Obama administration has also announced plans to end mass surveillance programmes and has stated that the US will cease monitoring the personal communications of European leaders.\nWithin Europe there are also certain states that are moving closer to the US in developing harder cyber security capabilities, and doing so outside of the NATO framework. The UK government, for example, has taken steps to merge cyber security intelligence and military operations, and the French and German militaries are both developing offensive cyber capabilities . As previously stated, while there has been no NATO-led process for offensive cyber security, NATO's leading powers, including the US, are pursuing similar strategies domestically.\nCommon interests, values and threats also continue to bind American and European approaches to cyber security together. Both sides of the Atlantic advocate an open and accessible global cyber commons with minimal government restrictions, and an open internet is seen by both sides as central to driving economic growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Americans and Europeans are also unified in their approach to fighting cyber crime and securing critical infrastructure . This general approach stands in opposition to Russia and China, who are arguably more concerned with being able to control information that could destabilise their societies and who have argued for international rights to restrict and censor internet traffic on that basis . While this divide may be hindering wider international cooperation, it is evidence of a level of unity on the basic issues within the transatlantic area.\nIntra-alliance management of cyber security issues also remains an important area of focus for the NATO allies, not least because some NATO members are clearly more concerned about cyber security than others. Estonia, the NATO member victim to the most significant attacks on its critical infrastructure, does not have the same level of cyber security concerns as Portugal, for example. But this is not necessarily an impediment to a NATO cyber security role, especially as NATO members have tended to specialise and develop niche capabilities that benefit the wider membership. Perhaps now more than ever NATO's capability aggregation role -- amassing capabilities against a common threat -- and its role in facilitating “smart defence”, are of crucial importance . Former Secretary General Rasmussen emphasised this himself in 2011, saying that “Smart defence is about building security for less money by working\ntogether and being more flexible” . In an environment where NATO members' defence budgets are under strain, and where the US is concerned about a lack of European Defence spending, specialisation within the alliance will be increasingly important. NATO's Cyber Security Centre of Excellence is an example of this concept in practice, where some NATO members (Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Spain) have invested in a valuable institutional resource that is beneficial to all members. Defence cooperation creates efficiencies and lowers transaction costs; this is being achieved through NATO's institutional frameworks and potentially lowering the scope for intra-alliance divides.",
    "## Conclusion": "While NATO has tried to come to terms with some of the strategic challenges involved in enhancing the cyber security of its members, there are still some unresolved and perhaps unresolvable cyber security issues. Reliably attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, responding to the diversity of actors involved and deterring cyber attacks, for example, will continue to be difficult and possibly intractable problems. NATO appears so far to have accepted this and adopted a cyber security posture that is pragmatic and deals with attacks on a case by case basis. Its defensive role, based around deterrence by denial, is appropriate given the reluctance to use the alliance for offensive cyber purposes, and its focus is in areas where it has a clear and compelling political and strategic interest; in cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and cyber warfare.\nThe defence of NATO's own digital networks continues to be of paramount importance. However, there is some evidence that the alliance is taking a wider and deeper role in cyber security in the North Atlantic area. The adoption of an Article 5 approach to cyber attacks is foremost in this regard, but the efforts that have been made to forge private sector partnerships and to develop normative and legal mechanisms for cyber security are also significant. Ultimately, cyber security remains a national responsibility for NATO members.\nWhat is perhaps most remarkable about how NATO has adapted to cyber security challenges is the institutional capacity the alliance has put in place. This institutional development has been driven mostly by external threats, from terrorist groups initially, but most recently by state actors, and these have accelerated the political and institutional focus on cyber security within the alliance. The alliance's integrated military command has always been one of its most important institutional assets and has historically allowed NATO members to coordinate military operations. The political integration and coordination provided by the North Atlantic Council has also been noteworthy throughout alliance history. In a similar vein, NATO now has a common cyber security capacity through which members can coordinate responses to cyber security incidents and provide channels of communication that are likely to continue to be important as cyber threats evolve.\nTransatlantic tensions on cyber security issues are certainly in evidence, and these stem from broader tensions between the US and Europe over the response to 9/11 and the role of the internet in surveillance. Despite this, there is a considerable degree of unity on the core cyber security challenges within the NATO membership. The balance between privacy and security will continue to be debated within NATO member states, but at this stage, this does not appear to be inhibiting a common and unified approach to at least defensive cyber operations. Whether NATO will take on an offensive cyber security posture at some stage will be an issue to monitor. The requirements of\nimplementing an Article 5 response to a major cyber attack might provide momentum for the development of offensive capabilities to be deployed as part of a unified NATO command, but it is more likely that NATO's most prominent players will continue to develop and deploy these kinds of capabilities outside of NATO channels.\nFinally, it is worth returning to NATO's core functions: collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. In all these areas, a NATO cyber security role would appear to have considerable merit. Global security challenges invariably require multilateral solutions and NATO has a range of adaptable institutional capabilities that are reasonably well suited to the task at hand.",

The US has not officially acknowledged involvement in the Stuxnet attack, but the software is widely considered to have been developed and deployed by the US and Israeli governments.\n3. This attack will be discussed further in a later section. Estonia joined NATO in 2004 and the incident provoked considerable debate over whether NATO should invoke Article 5 in response to the attacks.\n4. Cyber espionage is considered here as distinct from industrial espionage which is conducted by and against private businesses.\n5. During the Bosnian conflict 692,000 refugees fled into other countries including over 300,000 to Germany. This led to pressure for NATO intervention.\n6. The Estonia attacks in 2007, for example, were arguably deeply caught up in Estonian and Russian identity politics.\n7.

This article explores the definitional and theoretical problems in analysing the emerging cyber security field and seeks to provide an outline of the main strategic challenges that cyber attacks pose for NATO. The article evaluates the institutional structures and processes put in place by NATO to confront cyber threats and moves on to explore the extent of transatlantic unity around NATO's emerging doctrine for cyber defence. It is argued that NATO's response to cyber security is rooted in its prior adaptation to the changing security environment of the 1990s and the threat from international terrorism post 9-11. More recently, cyber attacks from state and state-sponsored actors have given impetus to NATO's emerging cyber security doctrine. The article finds that despite recent controversies over cyber surveillance, there is a considerable degree of unity within the alliance on the main cyber security issues. As a multilateral security organisation with a strong institutional foundation, NATO is also relatively well placed to respond to rapidly evolving cyber threats.\nKeywords: NATO; cyber defence; cyber security; strategy; institutional adaptation\nEver since its formation in 1949, NATO has gone through a sustained process of evolution, adding new members, new partners and new institutional capabilities. Now that the long and arduous ISAF mission in Afghanistan has formally ended, and in the context of a host of new security challenges -- including a newly assertive Russia, widespread instability across the Middle East and North Africa, and increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region -- the alliance must continue to adapt in order to stay relevant in a volatile and unpredictable security environment. One area of growing focus in this context is cyber security. This rapidly evolving security field featured prominently in NATO's 2010 Strategic Concept  and the alliance has invested considerable resources in enhancing its cyber capabilities and securing its networks against what former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has called an “exponentially increasing volume and sophistication of malicious cyber activity” (2013). In September 2014, at the NATO summit in Cardiff, NATO took a big step forward, recognising for the first time that cyber attacks against its members could prompt a collective response\nunder Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty . This enhanced Cyber Defence Policy put cyber security at the heart of NATO's operational outlook. The much-publicised cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in December 2014 have further heightened attention to cyber threats within the transatlantic community and provoked new sanctions against North Korean officials .\nDespite advances in NATO's cyber security posture, unresolved tensions exist within the NATO membership on cyber security issues. Recent revelations by Edward Snowden relating to the US government's mass surveillance programmes, the development of offensive cyber capabilities within the US intelligence and defence community, and the willingness to deploy “cyber weapons” for strategic gain, as in the case of the Stuxnet attack against Iran, indicate that America may be intent on aggressively maximising its power in cyberspace. In contrast, in many European states, and within the European Union (EU) in particular, the current approach appears to be based on softer forms of cyber power, including the development of defensive capabilities, civil and criminal mechanisms, cyber security norms and legal frameworks . In addition to this apparent political divergence, NATO is only beginning to adapt to strategically different cyber security issues. A geographically located and focused alliance is now having to deal with a virtual realm through which malicious code can be deployed instantaneously from anywhere on the planet. Accurately identifying who is responsible for cyber attacks, responding to them and even preventing them, also appears to be considerably more difficult in cyberspace than in the physical world. The rapidly growing technological sophistication of malware, moreover, is such that NATO and its members are at risk of being permanently behind the cyber security curve.\nIn the context of these political and strategic challenges, this article seeks to establish and explore the parameters of NATO's cyber security role. Specifically, it asks whether NATO can be an effective cyber security actor and whether progress has been made in forging a unified transatlantic approach to cyber security issues. The article proceeds in three stages. First, it explores how cyber attacks are challenging traditional conceptualisations of security issues and identifies different categories of cyber security where a NATO role is developing. It is argued that NATO is focused primarily on defending its own digital networks, but that it is also forging a broader role in defending NATO members against cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. Second, the article charts the development of an institutional and policy focus on cyber security within the alliance from the early cyber attacks against NATO by Serbian hackers in 1999 through to the adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy in September 2014. In particular, this section highlights how the threat of acts of cyber terrorism in the post 9/11 security environment gave NATO impetus to invest in this area of security, but that in recent years, threats from NATO's more traditional adversaries, Russia and China, have driven policy. Third, the article explores NATO's emerging collective cyber security doctrine and reflects on how well-suited the alliance is to respond to the many political and strategic challenges posed by online threats. The article finds that differences between NATO members on cyber security, which stem from broader disputes over the response to international terrorism after 9/11, are not insurmountable. In fact, NATO's ability to refine its institutional, operational and political capabilities, as well as the ongoing need for multilateral responses to cyber threats, makes the alliance a valuable asset to its members.\nCyber security -- conceptual and strategic challenges\nThe definitional and conceptual challenges of the cyber realm are something that scholars have struggled with fairly continuously since “cyber security” entered the popular lexicon. As Laasme (2011, p. 61) has stated:“Even though it might not be NATO's mission to classify and define everything in cyber-space, it is the alliance's role to prevent crises, manage conflicts, and defend one another against attacks, including against new threats -- none of which can be conducted with vague directions and abstruse concepts.”\nThis applies in the same way to the study of cyber security issues. Some conceptual clarity is required.\nCyber security, at its most basic level, is about being secure from (a) cyber attacks -- efforts to disrupt, delay or destroy computer networks, and (b) cyber exploitation -- efforts to covertly obtain information from computer networks . These attacks can take a number of different forms, and new tools for cyber intrusion are constantly being developed. One of the most common forms of malicious online activity are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are aimed at crippling a target's ability to operate web-based content and communications by bombarding it with “packets” of information. Perhaps the most prominent example of such an attack was against Estonian government ministries and media outlets in 2007 in reaction to the dismantling of a Soviet memorial in Tallinn. Malicious viruses can also be sent to networked computers to render them inoperable and to destroy information stored on them. On the cyber exploitation side, “phishing” attacks are common. These involve an unwitting target clicking on a link in an email or a webpage which covertly downloads malicious software to the user's computer. An attacker is then able to gain control or access to information stored on that computer and the network it is attached to. In some cases, the extent of control that hackers are able to maintain over compromised computer networks is extensive. Botnets can be created, which are networks of compromised computers through which a hacker is able to monitor web traffic and access confidential information over a sustained period of time. According to NATO and the US government, the volume and sophistication of both cyber attacks and cyber exploitation is rising .\nCyber security can be further conceptualised by considering the motivations of the attacker and the choice of target. In this respect, it is useful to divide cyber security issues into four main categories: cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. First, cyber crime is a growing cause for concern for NATO members. The vast majority of attacks in this area are carried out by private individuals or groups, directed against private individuals and businesses, and take the form of identity theft and financial fraud. In this respect, the motivation for the attacks is usually financial gain. According to the annual Norton cyber crime report, global cyber crime cost $113 billion dollars in 2013 with 378 million total victims . In both Europe and America, cyber crime is a widespread problem. A recent survey suggested 12% of European internet users have had their social media or email account hacked, while 7% have been the victim of credit card or banking fraud online . In the US, financial losses from cyber crime may constitute as much as 1% of US GDP . While this is not a military threat, the rapid growth of organised online crime is being viewed as a serious threat to the national security of NATO members .\nCyber espionage, as conducted by state actors, is another category of malicious online activity. This involves state controlled or directed cyber attackers targeting private businesses and foreign governments in order to steal sensitive information for commercial, political and military gain. Cyber crime is different from cyber espionage in that the former is conducted by private individuals or groups, and the latter is conducted by (or on behalf of) a state in order to enhance that state's knowledge and capabilities. Espionage is not a new security challenge and nations have always tried to covertly obtain information from their adversaries. Nevertheless, the advent of a global network of interconnected computers changes espionage dynamics profoundly. As Mohan (2013) explains, in reference to recent revelations about Chinese hacking: “That corporations spy on each other within and across nations is not new. It is the Chinese military's decision to deploy massive cyber resources against the US companies that is startling. China's massive cyber efforts have begun to blur the distinction between commercial espionage and national security.”\nChina's common counterclaim is that such accusations are themselves politically or commercially motivated and the Chinese government has often stated that there is no evidence linking attacks to the Chinese state . Nevertheless, the scope of the problem, particularly for the US, is extreme. It has been estimated that in 2007 the US Department of Defense lost between 25 and 27 terabytes of data from its systems, which is about 5000 DVDs of information . This kind of data extrication would have been much more difficult to accomplish in the pre-computer age.\nCyber terrorism is another category of cyber activity and perhaps the most difficult to define. According to Rollins and Wilson (2007, p. 3), a cyber attack can qualify as an act of cyber terrorism if (a) its effects are comparable to a terrorist attack: “when computer attacks result in effects that are disruptive enough to generate fear comparable to a traditional act of terrorism”, or (b) if the intent is to coerce political change: “Cyber terrorism exists when unlawful or politically motivated computer attacks are done to intimidate or coerce a government or people to further a political objective”. Dorothy Denning takes a similar approach, describing cyber terrorism as attacks against computer systems designed “to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives”, and as either being violent or causing “enough harm to generate fear” (2000 cited Weimann 2004, p. 4). In a wider sense, there is growing evidence that terrorist organisations are using the internet for a variety of nefarious purposes, including promoting their ideology, garnering political support and planning terrorist attacks. In Iraq after 2003 the internet became a tool for insurgents to recruit suicide bombers . Groups like Al Qaeda Hezbollah and ISIS are become increasingly adept at using the internet in operations and appear to have already developed the knowledge and skills to conduct damaging cyber attacks . Security agencies in many countries have also been given enhanced authority to monitor the internet and email communications for terrorist activity, and government agencies, national militaries and critical infrastructure providers may be vulnerable to cyber attacks from terrorist groups. While no one has yet lost their life as a result of a cyber attack -- cyber terrorism is thus a non-violent form of terrorism -- political coercion and spreading fear through such attacks are beginning to become important strategic considerations.\nThe final dimension of cyber security is cyber warfare. This is another area where scholars and practitioners continue to debate definitions and where a significant degree\nof scepticism exists as to whether the term “cyberwar” itself is a helpful or accurate term . Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (2011a) has referred to cyber attacks against NATO members as constituting “a new form of permanent, low-level warfare”, which necessarily would require long-term security cooperation to counter. Here, it is the political nature of cyber attacks against NATO, and that foreign states appeared to be directly involved, that distinguish them from other forms of online activity. Although acts of cyberwar have not to date been violent in themselves (as with cyber terrorism), cyber operations can add significantly to military campaigns by “amplifying” kinetic effects on the battlefield . Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, which was preceded by sustained cyber attacks against Georgian government and military units, and which arguably gave Russia a significant strategic advantage, is a prominent example in recent history . Nation states themselves are also using cyber attacks as part of military operations and incorporating cyber security into strategic and operational planning. In this sense, cyber security is being militarised and nationalised. The US army has officially acknowledged cyber warfare as an element of strategic doctrine and has a dedicated Cyber Command, tasked with coordinating the US military's defensive and offensive cyber warfare operations, counterintelligence and protecting military networks . Close links between the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and cyber attacks were identified in February 2013  and, according to a 2011 report by the US Centre for Strategic and International Studies, 33 states include cyber warfare in their military planning and organisation .\nCyber attacks are also an increasingly influential part of the operational environment in which NATO member states are involved. As US Marine Lt. Gen. R.P Mills has revealed, in reference to NATO's war with the Taliban in Afghanistan,“I was able to use my cyber operations against my adversary with great impact. I was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire, to affect my operations. (cited Satter 2012)”\nThe cyber domain has also been visible and influential in the conflicts in Syria and Libya. NATO took the lead role in running the ISAF operation in Afghanistan since 2003 and its members have vital strategic interests in the Middle East and North Africa. If this kind of activity is taking place in theatres where NATO is deployed, then it is natural to expect NATO to have an interest in developing cyber warfare capabilities.\nCyber security is thus a broad concept, and distinctions between different types of cyber attack need to be made. Cyber crime is clearly an area of growth activity, although it requires civil and legal responses. NATO has never been a police organisation or a criminal justice body, and a NATO role here may not be appropriate. Cyber espionage, however, is an area where a NATO role might be both appropriate and necessary, especially given that its own networks and facilities store highly sensitive and confidential information that could be used to the political and military advantage of non-NATO members. NATO would appear to have a natural stake in working towards the prevention of cyber terrorism. It is a high-profile organisation with members that have been subject to various forms of terrorism historically, and which has previously invoked Article 5, the collective defence clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, in response to the attacks by a non-state actor on 9/11. Cyber warfare is another area where a NATO role would appear to make sense. NATO forces have been involved in a wide\nJ. Burton\nrange of conflicts in the post-cold war era, and cyber operations are increasingly part of those conflicts and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.\nTable 1 categorises the multi-dimensional challenge of enhancing cyber security, and indicates areas where NATO may have core interests.\nAs well as operating in a number of different dimensions, cyber security is challenging some of the strategic thinking on which NATO is founded. First, the alliance's understanding of territory is changing. NATO has traditionally been an alliance based on defending its members from geographically proximate security threats. During the cold war in particular, emphasis was placed on the alliance's ability to hold off the Soviet Union \"... as far to the east in Germany as possible\" , and even in the early post-cold war era, the geographical scope of NATO operations was self-evident. The conflicts in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) took place on NATO's physical periphery, in clearly defined (though disputed) territories, and had direct geo-political consequences for NATO members, including considerable cross-border refugee flows . Cyber attacks, in contrast, occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet. This presents a new challenge to geographically defined and located security organisations. While there is some evidence of NATO going through a process of \"de-territorialisation\" in the post-cold war era , such as a focus on out of area operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya and anti-piracy operations in East Africa, the changing territorial dynamics of cyberspace pose significant questions for NATO's on-going strategic role. Can a geographically located alliance respond to a geographically indeterminate threat?\nAn interrelated problem for NATO in this area is attribution: accurately identifying who is responsible for instigating cyber attacks. When the United States was attacked on 9/11, the hijackers were quickly identified and NATO participated in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan on the basis of evidence that al Qaeda and the Taliban had been involved and complicit, respectively, in the attacks. But an intra-alliance controversy ensued over the widening of the War on Terror to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. As German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in August 2002,\nTable 1. Cyber security by target, category and motivation.\n|   | Cyber crime (criminal motivation) | Cyber espionage (enhance state capabilities) | Cyber terrorism (political coercion, to cause fear) | Cyber warfare (enhance military operations)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Target of cyber attacks:  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Private individuals | x |  |  |   |\n|  Business (non-critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Business (critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Government departments/facilities |  | x | x | x  |\n|  Military/defence forces |  | x | x | x  |\nCore NATO role - xxx\nPeripheral NATO role - xxx\nOur analysis shows that the threat comes primarily from Islamic terrorism. To date no one can rule out another major attack. Nor, however, has anyone proved so far that Saddam Hussein has any links with organisations such as al Qaeda. (cited Loewen and Nabers 2005)”\nThis was, at least in part, a problem of attribution, caused by having to face a transnational adversary that was not operating from a fixed geographical location. A similar challenge exists with respect to cyber security. Recent advances in “cyber-forensics” have allowed investigators to trace attacks to particular sources, but compared to fingerprints and other forms of physical DNA, these capabilities are imprecise . As NATO itself has recognised, “Attribution in Cyber-attacks proves extremely difficult to obtain and evidence is hard to capture” . The aforementioned revelations about PLA involvement in cyber attacks against US companies and government facilities are illustrative of this dilemma. The attacks were traced to a specific building in Beijing, but proving or asserting individual, institutional and governmental complicity remained problematic. The attribution problem was also demonstrated in the more recent cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in 2014. The US government claimed North Korean involvement, but did not reveal specific digital evidence, and some cyber security experts pointed the finger at disaffected former employees of the Sony Corporation . There is also increasing evidence to suggest that states are supporting sub-state or state-affiliated actors in carrying our cyber attacks, such as networks of semi-autonomous “patriot hackers” . This makes attribution even more difficult and allows states to maintain a level of plausible deniability.\nAnother strategic conundrum that NATO faces in the cyber realm is its ability to deter cyber attacks. NATO has always been an organisation based on building and maintaining a deterrent, both through nuclear weapons and conventional capabilities. During the cold war, military planners aimed to punish the enemy in the event of an attack -- through retaliation, deny their enemy the ability to fulfil the objectives of a military strike -- through dispersion of targets, for example, and/or compel an enemy to desist from attacks -- through economic, political or military inducements. After the demise of the Soviet Union, deterrence continued to be a central part of NATO doctrine and was prominent in the 1991 Strategic Concept . Even in the post 9-11 era, NATO held on to this concept in confronting terrorism. The 2003 Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism, for example, was based on “... the assumption that it is preferable to deter terrorist attacks or to prevent their occurrence rather than deal with their consequences” . Deterrence was also absorbed into specific counterterrorist operations, such as Operation Active Endeavour, a naval exercise in the Mediterranean that was intended to “... deter, defend, disrupt and protect against terrorism” .\nBut NATO may not be so well placed to deter attacks in cyberspace. Tang Lan and Zhang Xin have argued that “the anonymity, the global reach, the scattered nature, and the interconnectedness of information networks greatly reduce the efficacy of cyber deterrence and can even render it completely useless” . Similarly, James Lewis has outlined how asymmetric vulnerabilities to attack, new classes of opponents with very different tolerance of risk, and the difficulty of crafting a proportional and credible threat, all erode the ability to deter in the cyber and space domains (2012 cited Anon 2012). A number of other weaknesses exist in the cyber deterrence framework. Nuclear weapons are capable of causing absolute devastation against a\npotential attacker. The possible scale and impact of cyber retaliation is, at least at current levels of cyber capabilities, far lower. Escalation is another option, whereby a cyber attack would be met by a conventional military response, such as a missile strike. These questions have been on NATO member's agendas. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan, for example, has said that, “A response to a cyber-incident or attack on the US would not necessarily be a cyber-response. All appropriate options would be on the table if we were attacked” (2011 cited Spillius 2011). However, if cyber attackers can remain anonymous, and continue to be free from any legal censure, and if NATO cannot reliably punish cyber attackers, deny the attackers the ability to mount attacks, or compel them to desist from mounting attacks in the first place, a NATO role in cyber security may not be an effective one.\nThese strategic issues are central to whether NATO can be an effective organisation in responding to the growing threat from cyber attacks and pose a number of important questions. Can NATO overcome the changing territorial dynamics of cyber security? Can attacks against NATO members be reliably attributed to specific actors? Can NATO deter cyber attacks?\n## NATO's institutional adaptation\nExplanations of NATO's evolving post-cold war role can be divided into three main theoretical camps. Realist and neorealist scholars have emphasised the continuity of external threats and have viewed the perpetuation of NATO as being based on the US desire to control and influence European members of the alliance . Institutionalist scholars have emphasised the adaptability of NATO to new security challenges and emphasised such concepts as path dependence and institutional “stickiness” as explaining NATO's perpetuation, which is to say that the adaptation of NATO structures has been seen as preferable to the reinvention/reestablishment of the alliance . Constructivist scholars have focused more on NATO's common identity as a community of democracies and the desire to expand that community to Central and Eastern Europe . Arguably, all three of these approaches are of utility in expanding NATO's emerging cyber security role. NATO members have consistently emphasised the threat from cyber attacks, and that the threat comes from state and state-supported actors (realism); there has been a concerted effort to adapt NATO's institutions, operations and doctrines to respond to cyber attacks (institutionalism); and cyber attacks cannot be separated from identity politics, even when the identity of cyber attackers is hard to establish (constructivism).\nThis section of the article combines insights from realist and institutional approaches to alliance transformation and argues that cyber threats have driven institutional change within NATO. In this respect, NATO has been under pressure to adjust its functions and design to deal with changing environmental demands . This process of evolution has taken place slowly and incrementally and has been only one facet of a broader adaptation on the part of the alliance to a diversifying and globalising security environment. It should also be noted that institutional adaptation is not a guarantee of effectiveness . Nevertheless, NATO's institutional strength and adaptability has made it a useful tool for dialogue, policy development and decision-making on cyber security within the Euro Atlantic area, and created opportunities for developing unified positions on the core issues.\nMore specifically, there appear to have been four drivers of this process of institutional evolution. First, NATO has taken steps to enhance its cyber security due to its operational experiences, including in Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan from 2003 and Libya in 2011. These conflicts have taken on a cyber dimension and NATO has had to incorporate cyber into strategic planning as a result. Second, the events of 9/11 created serious concerns within NATO over cyber terrorism (and terrorist use of the internet more broadly) and this has driven NATO's cyber security focus. Third, geostrategic rivalries with Russia and China have taken on an increasingly online dimension and NATO has responded accordingly. Fourth, the volume and severity of cyber attacks against NATO itself and its members has increased rapidly in the last decade. These changing dynamics have given NATO's political leaders incentives to enhance NATO's cyber security capabilities and created “triggers” for institutional change .\nCyber security first appeared on NATO's formal agenda at the 2002 Prague Summit, where NATO members committed to the “Initiation of measures to strengthen defence against cyber attacks” . This new focus stemmed from the conflict in Kosovo in 1999, where pro-Serbian hackers had targeted NATO communications infrastructure with a view to affecting its war fighting capabilities. A NATO website responsible for promoting NATO's role in the conflict was subjected to sustained DDoS attacks from Serbian hackers, and Chinese hackers targeted NATO members in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, leading to the White House website being taken offline for three days . The summit highlighted NATO's “ability to adjust to new priorities and to adapt its capabilities in order to meet new challenges” . This process of change was described as part of an “evolution” and was to occur “incrementally”, “on a continual and deliberate basis” . In a more concrete sense, the 2002 summit established an institutional capacity to respond to this growing concern. A NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) was formed and the NATO Cyber Defence Programme was established.\nNATO also took on a more active role in the fight against terrorism at this time. . The new commitment to cyber defence at the Prague summit was referred to as being part of a “package of measures ... to strengthen NATO's capabilities to defend against terrorism”  and was endorsed when the alliance was grappling with its response to 9/11, the US intervention in Afghanistan, in which several NATO members took an early lead role, and in the context of a changing US national security strategy that placed counterterrorism at its core. The US government was also instituting domestic reforms at this time that influenced the NATO process. In October 2001, the Bush administration signed the Patriot Act into law, which enhanced the government's domestic and foreign surveillance powers, established the National Electronic Crime Task Force, extended government powers to intercept and access electronic communications, and enhanced America's digital forensics capabilities. Perhaps most significantly, the Act included provisions for classifying computer crimes as acts of terrorism for the first time . Further to this, the Bush administration created the Office of Cyberspace Security in the White House and appointed prominent counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, to lead it. The newly created Department for Homeland Security was also given a statutory cyber security role. Tom Ridge, its first Director, highlighted the extent of the US government's concerns at this time: “Terrorists can sit at one computer connected to one network and can create worldwide havoc. [They] don't necessarily need a bomb or explosives to cripple a\nsector of the economy or shut down a power grid” (2003 cited Weimann 2004). This may have been an example of cyber security hyperbole, but the fear created by 9/11 and the prospect of terrorist groups developing sophisticated cyber attack capabilities were significant drivers of the US government's response to cyber security issues in the early post-9/11 period and influenced NATO's growing role in this area of policy.\nThe NATO summit in Riga in 2006 further endorsed the need to continue efforts to enhance NATO's cyber security and emphasis was placed on securing NATO's own information systems against cyber attack . Arguably, however, a broader NATO role in the cyber security of its members was still on the backburner. The 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, however, elevated the issue of cyber security within the alliance and shifted NATO's focus away from cyber terrorism to a focus on the threats posed by nation states and state-sponsored hackers. The attacks were thought to be a response to the removal of a monument to the Soviet liberation of Estonia, and took place over a sustained period of three weeks. All of the Estonian government's websites were shut down, along with the sites of two major banks, a number of political parties and three of the country's biggest news media organisations. From a strategic point of view, the attacks demonstrated a number of the problems outlined in the previous section, particularly the issue of attribution. The Estonian government accused the Russian government of instigating the attacks and saw Russia's refusal to participate in official investigations as confirming a level of culpability . NATO officials strongly suspected Russian state involvement, but found no direct evidence of a link. One NATO spokesperson said, “I won't point fingers. But these were not things done by a few individuals. This clearly bore the hallmarks of something concerted” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). The Estonian attacks also prompted a vigorous and prolonged internal debate within the alliance as to whether a cyber attack could form the basis of an Article 5 commitment. Estonia's defence Minister acknowledged that,“At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country. (2007 cited Traynor 2007)”\nHowever, the sustained cyber assault was widely viewed as a violation of Estonia's sovereignty and even an encroachment on its territorial integrity. As Linnar Viik, a consultant to the Estonian government, asserted, “... this is not some virtual world. This is part of our independence. And these attacks were an attempt to take one country back to the cave, back to the Stone Age” (2007 cited Finn 2007). Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip asked, “What's the difference between a blockade of harbours or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government institutions and newspaper websites?” (2007 cited Rid 2012b). NATO also recognised the severity of the problem, with one Brussels-based official stating: “This is an operational security issue, something we're taking very seriously. It goes to the heart of the alliance's modus operandi” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). In 2007, however, NATO was some way from establishing whether cyber attacks constituted an “armed attack” as stipulated in Article 5, and implementing a collective response to the attacks was problematic given the difficulty of attribution. Nevertheless, the incident formed the basis of a more unified alliance approach to cyber security and the development of enhanced capabilities .\nThe cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007 were not an isolated example of the evolving cyber threat. A number of other serious incidents raised the profile of cyber\nsecurity within NATO member states in late 2007 and 2008 and fuelled attention to strategic vulnerabilities within the transatlantic community. In August 2007, it was reported that Chinese hackers had broken into the networks of the German Chancellery and three other Berlin Ministries, and in November 2007 British intelligence agency MI5 stated that the PLA had been conducting a concerted campaign of cyber espionage against British businesses. In June 2008, Lithuania faced a barrage of cyber attacks after it vetoed an EU energy partnership deal with Russia. The Russian war against Georgia in August 2008 also featured Russian-based hackers using cyber attacks as a precursor to the invasion in order to create confusion among Georgian military units and government ministries and to prevent a coordinated response to the assault . Lastly, in November 2008, the US Pentagon issued a ban on all external hard drives after a USB drive was used by a foreign intelligence agency to upload spyware and data exfiltration software to Defence Department computers .\nThis growth in malicious cyber activity in 2007--2008 created a window of opportunity to develop multilateral mechanisms to respond to cyber security threats and various such measures were put in place over the course of 2008. In January that year, as a direct result of the Estonia attacks, NATO members endorsed a new Cyber Defence Policy, and in March the North Atlantic Council (NAC) established the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA). The CDMA aimed to integrate the alliance's cyber security functions and provide support for NATO members in the event of cyber attacks. A NATO spokesperson described the role of the centre as, “defence, whether an attack comes from state, criminal or other sources” (2008 cited Grant 2008). Later in 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was established in Tallinn, Estonia. While not part of the formal NATO command structure, the centre has taken a role in advancing NATO cyber security doctrine policy and developing cyber security capabilities. It has also helped to reduce alliance-wide transaction costs through the NATO “Smart Defence” initiative. Wallander (2000) has explained how highly institutionalised alliances like NATO create “assets” which help to sustain the alliance even as the security environment changes. The formation of these bodies should be seen in this context. They have provided mechanisms for the pooling of resources, avenues for negotiations between NATO members on cyber issues, enhanced decision-making within the alliance, and created incentives for all members to develop multilateral approaches to cyber security rather than isolated national ones.\nThe next major institutional development for NATO was the inclusion of cyber security in the November 2010 Strategic Concept, the third such Concept to be released in the post-cold war era. This was another important milestone for the alliance and a firm indication that NATO members considered cyber security to be an important area of focus. The concept emphasised “the next phase in NATO's evolution” and the need for “continuous reform” to meet modern security challenges . On cyber security specifically, it stated that cyber attacks were not just a national problem, but a collective threat to the “prosperity, security, and stability” of the whole of the Euro Atlantic area, recognising that such attacks were becoming, “more frequent, more organised and more costly in the damage that they inflict on government administrations, businesses, economies and potentially also transportation and supply networks and other critical infrastructure” . Interestingly, while the concept made reference to NATO's “ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyber-attacks” , the notion of deterrence was notably absent.\nNATO's institutional adaption to the threat of cyber attacks continued with the adoption of a revised Cyber Defence Policy in 2011, which placed emphasis on minimum\nrequirements for cyber defence of national networks and an integrated system of cyber governance within NATO, with the North Atlantic Council as the ultimate driver of NATO policy and cooperation in this area. The revised policy was another landmark in NATO's strategic thinking on cyber security, highlighted the need for pragmatic responses to cyber attacks (not being constrained by Article 5, for example), and recognised the importance of prevention of and resilience to attacks . The establishment of a Rapid Reaction Team in 2012 was also noteworthy. A team of six NATO computer experts were tasked with responding to cyber attacks in real time and re-establishing computer network functionality in the event of cyber attacks and/or network exploitation.\nA further notable contribution to NATO's adaptation to cyber security challenges was the publication of The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in March 2013. This document was produced by team of legal and technical experts working in conjunction with the CCD COE and aimed to codify and clarify possible responses to both the legal and strategic dilemmas around cyber attacks by apply existing international law to the cyber security arena. The document has advanced NATO's legal and strategic thinking on key cyber security issues, including on the problem of attribution, where it argues that states should bear some responsibility for cyber attacks emanating from within their jurisdiction. There are areas, however, that are underexplored in the document, including legal prohibitions on attacks that do not constitute a use of armed force and which take place outside of armed conflict (which still constitute the vast majority of cyber attacks), and kinetic-to-cyber operations, where conventional force might be used to destroy digital infrastructure .\nFinally, in September 2014, at its summit in Cardiff, NATO members endorsed the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy. In many ways, this was the culmination of the policy debate that was started within NATO by the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As a result of the policy, NATO will consider (and potentially implement) a collective Article 5 response to cyber attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. This landmark in NATO's cyber security evolution is not without its problems. Uncertainty remains as to how a collective response can be implemented when attribution is problematic, and it is not clear what threshold a cyber attack would need to meet to trigger an Article 5 response. Minor intrusions into NATO networks are clearly not what NATO policy-makers have in mind. However, cyber attacks with a severe impact on the economy, critical infrastructure and national security of NATO members may well fall into this category. As Jamie Shea, head of NATO's Emerging Security Challenges division, has stated: “We are keeping that ambiguous so a potential aggressor does not get the idea they can carry out cyber attacks up to a certain level with impunity” (2014 cited Washford 2014). It is also unclear what a collective cyber response by NATO would actually look like. NATO does not have the authority to implement sanctions against states for cyber attacks; digital retaliation is difficult although not impossible, as can be seen in the case of the (still unclaimed) attacks against North Korea in response to the Sony hack; and an attack using conventional force, which has not been ruled out, would clearly need to be proportional to the original offence. Nevertheless, 15 years after NATO first experienced cyber attacks, the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy had brought cyber security firmly inside the purview of NATO's evolving responsibilities. It has indicated that the alliance will respond deliberately and proportionally to any significant attack depending on the extent of the damage, the level of attribution, and the motives and identity of the attackers  (Table 2).\nDefence Studies 309\n# NATO's cyber security doctrine\nAlthough this institutional change has occurred incrementally, and has been driven by a diverse set of events and actors, cyber security appears to have found a foothold in NATO's doctrine for the defence of its members and for the general employment of NATO power in the post-cold war era. But what do these institutional developments tell us about NATO's collective cyber security doctrine? How do these capabilities, policies and institutions actually shape how NATO acts in cyberspace, and do they constitute a unified or uniform approach to cyber security across the transatlantic region?\nNATO's first priority has always been to defend the North Atlantic area, and, even though cyber threats emanate from cyberspace, the alliance's doctrine is still, for the most part, focused on the protection of its own computer networks. NATO's cyber command is centrally located in Brussels, where the CDMA and NCIRC provide coordination, real-time monitoring capabilities and intelligence sharing functions , and alliance officials are aware of the need to protect NATO's digital infrastructure spread across its many international sites. While NATO has taken a broader role in cyber defence as a result of the recent adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, its own operational security is paramount.\nSecond, NATO's cyber security doctrine and posture is still largely defensive. The alliance has not been involved in developing offensive cyber attack capabilities. These sorts of capabilities remain the purview of the national intelligence and security institutions of individual members. It may be that NATO's political and military command would be informed if a NATO member was involved in conducting offensive cyber security operations, especially if it was part of a wider NATO mission, but at the present time NATO's cyber command is not envisaged as having such a role.\nThird, although deterring cyber attacks is clearly not as straight forward as deterring conventional attacks from state actors, NATO cyber doctrine appears to be based in deterrence by denial. Given the difficulty of retaliating against cyber attackers and the inability to compel attackers to desist from attacks, denying them the ability to achieve their objectives has become the focus. NATO will make it as difficult as possible to infiltrate its systems and make sure hackers are aware that they are unlikely to be able to achieve their intended effects (Healey and van Bochoven 2012). Jamie Shea has recently highlighted the utility of this defensive posture .\nTable 2. The institutional development of NATO's cyber security role.\n|  1999 | Cyber attacks directed against NATO during the Kosovo conflict  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  2002 | Prague summit – Cyber security appears on NATO’s formal agenda for the first time.

While NATO has clearly been influenced by the diffusion of power and influence away from the state in the post-cold war era, and particularly threats from terrorist groups and non-affiliated hackers, concerns about Russia and China have contributed to a revised sense of state adversaries during this period. Despite NATO's preponderance of power in other areas, its strategic rivals have proved highly capable in the cyber security arena. General Keith Alexander, head of the US Cyber Command, has described Russia as a “near peer” in terms of its cyber capabilities (2010 cited Giles 2011) and Giles (2011, p. 54) has argued both China's and Russia's emphasis on semi-autonomous agencies in cyber security operations gives them a distinct advantage over the US and its allies. Russian and Chinese-based hackers have regularly targeted NATO's networks in response to political disputes, most recently in response to NATO's stance on the Ukraine crisis , and both countries have an interest in exfiltrating the confidential, operational, strategic and political information that flows through NATO networks. Although some attempts have been made to enhance cyber security cooperation between NATO and Russia, such as dialogue at the NATO-Russia Council level , the Russian annexation of Crimea and on-going efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine, which have taken place alongside new cyber attacks against NATO members, have put any meaningful cooperation on cyber issues on hold. The US Justice Department's indictment of five member of the PLA in May 2014 has similarly stalled any attempt to cooperate with China on cyber issues .\nLastly, as with many other areas of NATO's security doctrine, NATO's approach to cyber security is based around developing cooperative relationships, both internally and externally. NATO has developed a range of formal partnerships in the post-cold war era that are increasingly addressing cyber security issues, including the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI), the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). Cyber Security is increasingly a component of the Individual Partnership Action Plans (IPAPs) negotiated with countries around the world, such as New Zealand, and NATO has developed enhanced links with the private sector and critical infrastructure providers in advancing cyber defence in the North Atlantic area . These diverse networks of partnerships allow for global cooperation on cyber security issues and help to develop cyber security norms, standards and capabilities. In this respect, NATO's cyber security doctrine covers and is part of each of its three main operational pillars: Crisis Management (e.g. the crisis surrounding the cyber attacks against Estonian in 2007), Collective Defence (e.g. the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy) and Cooperative Security.\n## A transatlantic divide?\nNATO has frequently been beset by intra-alliance tensions and in the cyber security arena there appears to be at least some evidence of a divergence in European and US policy approaches. Recent revelations by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, for example, have exposed transatlantic tensions around surveillance, and the alleged NSA hacking of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, which led to an angry phone call between Obama and Merkel and the summoning of the US Ambassador to Germany, was a major embarrassment for the US government . The US has arguably taken a harder security stance on cyber issues since 9/11 because of its desire to protect the US homeland, and because it faces increased strategic rivalry from rival global\npower centres. A more aggressive cyber posture can certainly be seen in the establishment of the US Cyber Command, a unified and expanding military command structure tasked with coordinating defensive and offensive cyber operations for all branches of the US military, the deployment of the Stuxnet software against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the Patriot Act, and the mass surveillance programmes run by the NSA, including the Prism programme. The use of offensive and even pre-emptive operations by the US government has also grown in recent years, with a high number of ICT specialists employed to penetrate foreign networks . In 2012, Obama signed Presidential Decision Directive 20, a classified document that gave the US military the authority to conduct more aggressive cyber operations to thwart cyber attacks against US systems .\nThe wealth of cyber resources and capabilities that exist within the US military and associated agencies may be a reason in and of itself why the US approach to managing cyber conflict has been dominated by that branch of the US government. Mary O Connell takes up this line of argument, suggesting that the US government has become “trapped in an ideology of militarism”  and claiming that “the US military today has the largest concentration of expertise and legal authority with respect to cyberspace” . She further notes that in 2009, following the Estonia attacks, the Russia Georgia war and the release of the Stuxnet virus, the US government “began releasing a number of policies on cyber security that were predominantly military in orientation” . This would seem to support the line of argument advanced by this article, that threats from state rather than non-state actors explain the elevation of cyber security as an issue within the transatlantic security community.\nThis hard power approach to cyber security in the US could also be explained by the rhetoric being used to describe cyber attacks in the American context. Former Defence Secretary Leon Panetta's claim that the US could face a “cyber Pearl Harbour” is a prime example of the securitisation and militarisation of cyber discourse. When there is a propensity at the highest levels of government to adopt Second World War and cold war analogies to characterise cyber conflict, this can shape US policy and doctrine in a certain direction. Shachtman and Singer (2011) argue that clear links can be found between cold war strategic thinking and the formulation of current US policy, especially the idea that cyber attacks might be met with conventional attacks; an idea “lifted” from the 1960s strategy of flexible response. Commercial and political motives might also have led to the US taking a more military-based approach to cyber security issues. They further argue that “there is a massive amount of threat inflation going on in Washington's discussion of online dangers, most frequently by those with political or profit motives in hyping the threats” Shachtman and Singer (2011). While we should be careful in suggesting that a new “cyber industrial complex” is forming in America, the huge US government spending on cyber protection for the federal government, such as a $1 billion contract awarded to Raytheon by the Department for Homeland Security in 2015, may create incentives for responses to cyber security threats to be militarised. Equally, threat inflation may displace attention from the arguably more pervasive problem of cyber crime.\nIn Europe, at least on the surface, a softer cyber security approach is evident. EU responses to cyber security have typically emphasised criminal and civil procedures for dealing with cyber attacks, reflecting a European preference for soft power over hard power, and there has been a broader reluctance in Europe to militarise cyberspace. The new European Union Cyber Security Strategy, for example, is based on promoting\nnorms in cyberspace, encouraging dialogue between nations, enhancing technical capacity and resilience, and fighting cybercrime . The most controversial aspect has been the requirement for businesses in Europe, and particularly critical infrastructure providers, to report cyber attacks to a central authority. Overall though, the strategy is defensively orientated and non-militaristic.\nThe level of transatlantic divergence on cyber security issues should not be overstated, however. Given the impact of 9/11 on the US national security establishment, it is not surprising that the balance in America has tilted towards security over privacy in the decade or so since the attacks. In the context of the rise of China, the US pivot to Asia and an increasingly assertive Russia, the US is also bound to have an interest in staying ahead of its state competitors in cyber space. The US has shown some restraint in the use of its cyber capabilities and a recognisable commitment to the emergence of normative constraints on cyber warfare. Offensive cyber attacks were considered by the Obama administration as part of the campaign against Colonel Gadhafi's Libya in 2011, but a reluctance to set a dangerous precedent in how wars are fought, as well as a degree of concern over securing Congressional support for such strategy, meant that the campaign was limited to conventional capabilities . The Obama administration has also announced plans to end mass surveillance programmes and has stated that the US will cease monitoring the personal communications of European leaders.\nWithin Europe there are also certain states that are moving closer to the US in developing harder cyber security capabilities, and doing so outside of the NATO framework. The UK government, for example, has taken steps to merge cyber security intelligence and military operations, and the French and German militaries are both developing offensive cyber capabilities . As previously stated, while there has been no NATO-led process for offensive cyber security, NATO's leading powers, including the US, are pursuing similar strategies domestically.\nCommon interests, values and threats also continue to bind American and European approaches to cyber security together. Both sides of the Atlantic advocate an open and accessible global cyber commons with minimal government restrictions, and an open internet is seen by both sides as central to driving economic growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Americans and Europeans are also unified in their approach to fighting cyber crime and securing critical infrastructure . This general approach stands in opposition to Russia and China, who are arguably more concerned with being able to control information that could destabilise their societies and who have argued for international rights to restrict and censor internet traffic on that basis . While this divide may be hindering wider international cooperation, it is evidence of a level of unity on the basic issues within the transatlantic area.\nIntra-alliance management of cyber security issues also remains an important area of focus for the NATO allies, not least because some NATO members are clearly more concerned about cyber security than others. Estonia, the NATO member victim to the most significant attacks on its critical infrastructure, does not have the same level of cyber security concerns as Portugal, for example. But this is not necessarily an impediment to a NATO cyber security role, especially as NATO members have tended to specialise and develop niche capabilities that benefit the wider membership. Perhaps now more than ever NATO's capability aggregation role -- amassing capabilities against a common threat -- and its role in facilitating “smart defence”, are of crucial importance . Former Secretary General Rasmussen emphasised this himself in 2011, saying that “Smart defence is about building security for less money by working\ntogether and being more flexible” . In an environment where NATO members' defence budgets are under strain, and where the US is concerned about a lack of European Defence spending, specialisation within the alliance will be increasingly important. NATO's Cyber Security Centre of Excellence is an example of this concept in practice, where some NATO members (Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Spain) have invested in a valuable institutional resource that is beneficial to all members. Defence cooperation creates efficiencies and lowers transaction costs; this is being achieved through NATO's institutional frameworks and potentially lowering the scope for intra-alliance divides.\n## Conclusion\nWhile NATO has tried to come to terms with some of the strategic challenges involved in enhancing the cyber security of its members, there are still some unresolved and perhaps unresolvable cyber security issues. Reliably attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, responding to the diversity of actors involved and deterring cyber attacks, for example, will continue to be difficult and possibly intractable problems. NATO appears so far to have accepted this and adopted a cyber security posture that is pragmatic and deals with attacks on a case by case basis. Its defensive role, based around deterrence by denial, is appropriate given the reluctance to use the alliance for offensive cyber purposes, and its focus is in areas where it has a clear and compelling political and strategic interest; in cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and cyber warfare.\nThe defence of NATO's own digital networks continues to be of paramount importance. However, there is some evidence that the alliance is taking a wider and deeper role in cyber security in the North Atlantic area. The adoption of an Article 5 approach to cyber attacks is foremost in this regard, but the efforts that have been made to forge private sector partnerships and to develop normative and legal mechanisms for cyber security are also significant. Ultimately, cyber security remains a national responsibility for NATO members.\nWhat is perhaps most remarkable about how NATO has adapted to cyber security challenges is the institutional capacity the alliance has put in place. This institutional development has been driven mostly by external threats, from terrorist groups initially, but most recently by state actors, and these have accelerated the political and institutional focus on cyber security within the alliance. The alliance's integrated military command has always been one of its most important institutional assets and has historically allowed NATO members to coordinate military operations. The political integration and coordination provided by the North Atlantic Council has also been noteworthy throughout alliance history. In a similar vein, NATO now has a common cyber security capacity through which members can coordinate responses to cyber security incidents and provide channels of communication that are likely to continue to be important as cyber threats evolve.\nTransatlantic tensions on cyber security issues are certainly in evidence, and these stem from broader tensions between the US and Europe over the response to 9/11 and the role of the internet in surveillance. Despite this, there is a considerable degree of unity on the core cyber security challenges within the NATO membership. The balance between privacy and security will continue to be debated within NATO member states, but at this stage, this does not appear to be inhibiting a common and unified approach to at least defensive cyber operations. Whether NATO will take on an offensive cyber security posture at some stage will be an issue to monitor. The requirements of\nimplementing an Article 5 response to a major cyber attack might provide momentum for the development of offensive capabilities to be deployed as part of a unified NATO command, but it is more likely that NATO's most prominent players will continue to develop and deploy these kinds of capabilities outside of NATO channels.\nFinally, it is worth returning to NATO's core functions: collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. In all these areas, a NATO cyber security role would appear to have considerable merit. Global security challenges invariably require multilateral solutions and NATO has a range of adaptable institutional capabilities that are reasonably well suited to the task at hand.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

This article explores the definitional and theoretical problems in analysing the emerging cyber security field and seeks to provide an outline of the main strategic challenges that cyber attacks pose for NATO. The article evaluates the institutional structures and processes put in place by NATO to confront cyber threats and moves on to explore the extent of transatlantic unity around NATO's emerging doctrine for cyber defence. It is argued that NATO's response to cyber security is rooted in its prior adaptation to the changing security environment of the 1990s and the threat from international terrorism post 9-11. More recently, cyber attacks from state and state-sponsored actors have given impetus to NATO's emerging cyber security doctrine. The article finds that despite recent controversies over cyber surveillance, there is a considerable degree of unity within the alliance on the main cyber security issues. As a multilateral security organisation with a strong institutional foundation, NATO is also relatively well placed to respond to rapidly evolving cyber threats.\nKeywords: NATO; cyber defence; cyber security; strategy; institutional adaptation\nEver since its formation in 1949, NATO has gone through a sustained process of evolution, adding new members, new partners and new institutional capabilities. Now that the long and arduous ISAF mission in Afghanistan has formally ended, and in the context of a host of new security challenges -- including a newly assertive Russia, widespread instability across the Middle East and North Africa, and increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region -- the alliance must continue to adapt in order to stay relevant in a volatile and unpredictable security environment. One area of growing focus in this context is cyber security. This rapidly evolving security field featured prominently in NATO's 2010 Strategic Concept  and the alliance has invested considerable resources in enhancing its cyber capabilities and securing its networks against what former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has called an “exponentially increasing volume and sophistication of malicious cyber activity” (2013). In September 2014, at the NATO summit in Cardiff, NATO took a big step forward, recognising for the first time that cyber attacks against its members could prompt a collective response\nunder Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty . This enhanced Cyber Defence Policy put cyber security at the heart of NATO's operational outlook. The much-publicised cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in December 2014 have further heightened attention to cyber threats within the transatlantic community and provoked new sanctions against North Korean officials .\nDespite advances in NATO's cyber security posture, unresolved tensions exist within the NATO membership on cyber security issues. Recent revelations by Edward Snowden relating to the US government's mass surveillance programmes, the development of offensive cyber capabilities within the US intelligence and defence community, and the willingness to deploy “cyber weapons” for strategic gain, as in the case of the Stuxnet attack against Iran, indicate that America may be intent on aggressively maximising its power in cyberspace. In contrast, in many European states, and within the European Union (EU) in particular, the current approach appears to be based on softer forms of cyber power, including the development of defensive capabilities, civil and criminal mechanisms, cyber security norms and legal frameworks . In addition to this apparent political divergence, NATO is only beginning to adapt to strategically different cyber security issues. A geographically located and focused alliance is now having to deal with a virtual realm through which malicious code can be deployed instantaneously from anywhere on the planet. Accurately identifying who is responsible for cyber attacks, responding to them and even preventing them, also appears to be considerably more difficult in cyberspace than in the physical world. The rapidly growing technological sophistication of malware, moreover, is such that NATO and its members are at risk of being permanently behind the cyber security curve.\nIn the context of these political and strategic challenges, this article seeks to establish and explore the parameters of NATO's cyber security role. Specifically, it asks whether NATO can be an effective cyber security actor and whether progress has been made in forging a unified transatlantic approach to cyber security issues. The article proceeds in three stages. First, it explores how cyber attacks are challenging traditional conceptualisations of security issues and identifies different categories of cyber security where a NATO role is developing. It is argued that NATO is focused primarily on defending its own digital networks, but that it is also forging a broader role in defending NATO members against cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. Second, the article charts the development of an institutional and policy focus on cyber security within the alliance from the early cyber attacks against NATO by Serbian hackers in 1999 through to the adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy in September 2014. In particular, this section highlights how the threat of acts of cyber terrorism in the post 9/11 security environment gave NATO impetus to invest in this area of security, but that in recent years, threats from NATO's more traditional adversaries, Russia and China, have driven policy. Third, the article explores NATO's emerging collective cyber security doctrine and reflects on how well-suited the alliance is to respond to the many political and strategic challenges posed by online threats. The article finds that differences between NATO members on cyber security, which stem from broader disputes over the response to international terrorism after 9/11, are not insurmountable. In fact, NATO's ability to refine its institutional, operational and political capabilities, as well as the ongoing need for multilateral responses to cyber threats, makes the alliance a valuable asset to its members.\nCyber security -- conceptual and strategic challenges\nThe definitional and conceptual challenges of the cyber realm are something that scholars have struggled with fairly continuously since “cyber security” entered the popular lexicon. As Laasme (2011, p. 61) has stated:“Even though it might not be NATO's mission to classify and define everything in cyber-space, it is the alliance's role to prevent crises, manage conflicts, and defend one another against attacks, including against new threats -- none of which can be conducted with vague directions and abstruse concepts.”\nThis applies in the same way to the study of cyber security issues. Some conceptual clarity is required.\nCyber security, at its most basic level, is about being secure from (a) cyber attacks -- efforts to disrupt, delay or destroy computer networks, and (b) cyber exploitation -- efforts to covertly obtain information from computer networks . These attacks can take a number of different forms, and new tools for cyber intrusion are constantly being developed. One of the most common forms of malicious online activity are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are aimed at crippling a target's ability to operate web-based content and communications by bombarding it with “packets” of information. Perhaps the most prominent example of such an attack was against Estonian government ministries and media outlets in 2007 in reaction to the dismantling of a Soviet memorial in Tallinn. Malicious viruses can also be sent to networked computers to render them inoperable and to destroy information stored on them. On the cyber exploitation side, “phishing” attacks are common. These involve an unwitting target clicking on a link in an email or a webpage which covertly downloads malicious software to the user's computer. An attacker is then able to gain control or access to information stored on that computer and the network it is attached to. In some cases, the extent of control that hackers are able to maintain over compromised computer networks is extensive. Botnets can be created, which are networks of compromised computers through which a hacker is able to monitor web traffic and access confidential information over a sustained period of time. According to NATO and the US government, the volume and sophistication of both cyber attacks and cyber exploitation is rising .\nCyber security can be further conceptualised by considering the motivations of the attacker and the choice of target. In this respect, it is useful to divide cyber security issues into four main categories: cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. First, cyber crime is a growing cause for concern for NATO members. The vast majority of attacks in this area are carried out by private individuals or groups, directed against private individuals and businesses, and take the form of identity theft and financial fraud. In this respect, the motivation for the attacks is usually financial gain. According to the annual Norton cyber crime report, global cyber crime cost $113 billion dollars in 2013 with 378 million total victims . In both Europe and America, cyber crime is a widespread problem. A recent survey suggested 12% of European internet users have had their social media or email account hacked, while 7% have been the victim of credit card or banking fraud online . In the US, financial losses from cyber crime may constitute as much as 1% of US GDP . While this is not a military threat, the rapid growth of organised online crime is being viewed as a serious threat to the national security of NATO members .\nCyber espionage, as conducted by state actors, is another category of malicious online activity. This involves state controlled or directed cyber attackers targeting private businesses and foreign governments in order to steal sensitive information for commercial, political and military gain. Cyber crime is different from cyber espionage in that the former is conducted by private individuals or groups, and the latter is conducted by (or on behalf of) a state in order to enhance that state's knowledge and capabilities. Espionage is not a new security challenge and nations have always tried to covertly obtain information from their adversaries. Nevertheless, the advent of a global network of interconnected computers changes espionage dynamics profoundly. As Mohan (2013) explains, in reference to recent revelations about Chinese hacking: “That corporations spy on each other within and across nations is not new. It is the Chinese military's decision to deploy massive cyber resources against the US companies that is startling. China's massive cyber efforts have begun to blur the distinction between commercial espionage and national security.”\nChina's common counterclaim is that such accusations are themselves politically or commercially motivated and the Chinese government has often stated that there is no evidence linking attacks to the Chinese state . Nevertheless, the scope of the problem, particularly for the US, is extreme. It has been estimated that in 2007 the US Department of Defense lost between 25 and 27 terabytes of data from its systems, which is about 5000 DVDs of information . This kind of data extrication would have been much more difficult to accomplish in the pre-computer age.\nCyber terrorism is another category of cyber activity and perhaps the most difficult to define. According to Rollins and Wilson (2007, p. 3), a cyber attack can qualify as an act of cyber terrorism if (a) its effects are comparable to a terrorist attack: “when computer attacks result in effects that are disruptive enough to generate fear comparable to a traditional act of terrorism”, or (b) if the intent is to coerce political change: “Cyber terrorism exists when unlawful or politically motivated computer attacks are done to intimidate or coerce a government or people to further a political objective”. Dorothy Denning takes a similar approach, describing cyber terrorism as attacks against computer systems designed “to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives”, and as either being violent or causing “enough harm to generate fear” (2000 cited Weimann 2004, p. 4). In a wider sense, there is growing evidence that terrorist organisations are using the internet for a variety of nefarious purposes, including promoting their ideology, garnering political support and planning terrorist attacks. In Iraq after 2003 the internet became a tool for insurgents to recruit suicide bombers . Groups like Al Qaeda Hezbollah and ISIS are become increasingly adept at using the internet in operations and appear to have already developed the knowledge and skills to conduct damaging cyber attacks . Security agencies in many countries have also been given enhanced authority to monitor the internet and email communications for terrorist activity, and government agencies, national militaries and critical infrastructure providers may be vulnerable to cyber attacks from terrorist groups. While no one has yet lost their life as a result of a cyber attack -- cyber terrorism is thus a non-violent form of terrorism -- political coercion and spreading fear through such attacks are beginning to become important strategic considerations.\nThe final dimension of cyber security is cyber warfare. This is another area where scholars and practitioners continue to debate definitions and where a significant degree\nof scepticism exists as to whether the term “cyberwar” itself is a helpful or accurate term . Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (2011a) has referred to cyber attacks against NATO members as constituting “a new form of permanent, low-level warfare”, which necessarily would require long-term security cooperation to counter. Here, it is the political nature of cyber attacks against NATO, and that foreign states appeared to be directly involved, that distinguish them from other forms of online activity. Although acts of cyberwar have not to date been violent in themselves (as with cyber terrorism), cyber operations can add significantly to military campaigns by “amplifying” kinetic effects on the battlefield . Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, which was preceded by sustained cyber attacks against Georgian government and military units, and which arguably gave Russia a significant strategic advantage, is a prominent example in recent history . Nation states themselves are also using cyber attacks as part of military operations and incorporating cyber security into strategic and operational planning. In this sense, cyber security is being militarised and nationalised. The US army has officially acknowledged cyber warfare as an element of strategic doctrine and has a dedicated Cyber Command, tasked with coordinating the US military's defensive and offensive cyber warfare operations, counterintelligence and protecting military networks . Close links between the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and cyber attacks were identified in February 2013  and, according to a 2011 report by the US Centre for Strategic and International Studies, 33 states include cyber warfare in their military planning and organisation .\nCyber attacks are also an increasingly influential part of the operational environment in which NATO member states are involved. As US Marine Lt. Gen. R.P Mills has revealed, in reference to NATO's war with the Taliban in Afghanistan,“I was able to use my cyber operations against my adversary with great impact. I was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire, to affect my operations. (cited Satter 2012)”\nThe cyber domain has also been visible and influential in the conflicts in Syria and Libya. NATO took the lead role in running the ISAF operation in Afghanistan since 2003 and its members have vital strategic interests in the Middle East and North Africa. If this kind of activity is taking place in theatres where NATO is deployed, then it is natural to expect NATO to have an interest in developing cyber warfare capabilities.\nCyber security is thus a broad concept, and distinctions between different types of cyber attack need to be made. Cyber crime is clearly an area of growth activity, although it requires civil and legal responses. NATO has never been a police organisation or a criminal justice body, and a NATO role here may not be appropriate. Cyber espionage, however, is an area where a NATO role might be both appropriate and necessary, especially given that its own networks and facilities store highly sensitive and confidential information that could be used to the political and military advantage of non-NATO members. NATO would appear to have a natural stake in working towards the prevention of cyber terrorism. It is a high-profile organisation with members that have been subject to various forms of terrorism historically, and which has previously invoked Article 5, the collective defence clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, in response to the attacks by a non-state actor on 9/11. Cyber warfare is another area where a NATO role would appear to make sense. NATO forces have been involved in a wide\nJ. Burton\nrange of conflicts in the post-cold war era, and cyber operations are increasingly part of those conflicts and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.\nTable 1 categorises the multi-dimensional challenge of enhancing cyber security, and indicates areas where NATO may have core interests.\nAs well as operating in a number of different dimensions, cyber security is challenging some of the strategic thinking on which NATO is founded. First, the alliance's understanding of territory is changing. NATO has traditionally been an alliance based on defending its members from geographically proximate security threats. During the cold war in particular, emphasis was placed on the alliance's ability to hold off the Soviet Union \"... as far to the east in Germany as possible\" , and even in the early post-cold war era, the geographical scope of NATO operations was self-evident. The conflicts in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) took place on NATO's physical periphery, in clearly defined (though disputed) territories, and had direct geo-political consequences for NATO members, including considerable cross-border refugee flows . Cyber attacks, in contrast, occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet. This presents a new challenge to geographically defined and located security organisations. While there is some evidence of NATO going through a process of \"de-territorialisation\" in the post-cold war era , such as a focus on out of area operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya and anti-piracy operations in East Africa, the changing territorial dynamics of cyberspace pose significant questions for NATO's on-going strategic role. Can a geographically located alliance respond to a geographically indeterminate threat?\nAn interrelated problem for NATO in this area is attribution: accurately identifying who is responsible for instigating cyber attacks. When the United States was attacked on 9/11, the hijackers were quickly identified and NATO participated in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan on the basis of evidence that al Qaeda and the Taliban had been involved and complicit, respectively, in the attacks. But an intra-alliance controversy ensued over the widening of the War on Terror to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. As German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in August 2002,\nTable 1. Cyber security by target, category and motivation.\n|   | Cyber crime (criminal motivation) | Cyber espionage (enhance state capabilities) | Cyber terrorism (political coercion, to cause fear) | Cyber warfare (enhance military operations)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Target of cyber attacks:  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Private individuals | x |  |  |   |\n|  Business (non-critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Business (critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Government departments/facilities |  | x | x | x  |\n|  Military/defence forces |  | x | x | x  |\nCore NATO role - xxx\nPeripheral NATO role - xxx\nOur analysis shows that the threat comes primarily from Islamic terrorism. To date no one can rule out another major attack. Nor, however, has anyone proved so far that Saddam Hussein has any links with organisations such as al Qaeda. (cited Loewen and Nabers 2005)”\nThis was, at least in part, a problem of attribution, caused by having to face a transnational adversary that was not operating from a fixed geographical location. A similar challenge exists with respect to cyber security. Recent advances in “cyber-forensics” have allowed investigators to trace attacks to particular sources, but compared to fingerprints and other forms of physical DNA, these capabilities are imprecise . As NATO itself has recognised, “Attribution in Cyber-attacks proves extremely difficult to obtain and evidence is hard to capture” . The aforementioned revelations about PLA involvement in cyber attacks against US companies and government facilities are illustrative of this dilemma. The attacks were traced to a specific building in Beijing, but proving or asserting individual, institutional and governmental complicity remained problematic. The attribution problem was also demonstrated in the more recent cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in 2014. The US government claimed North Korean involvement, but did not reveal specific digital evidence, and some cyber security experts pointed the finger at disaffected former employees of the Sony Corporation . There is also increasing evidence to suggest that states are supporting sub-state or state-affiliated actors in carrying our cyber attacks, such as networks of semi-autonomous “patriot hackers” . This makes attribution even more difficult and allows states to maintain a level of plausible deniability.\nAnother strategic conundrum that NATO faces in the cyber realm is its ability to deter cyber attacks. NATO has always been an organisation based on building and maintaining a deterrent, both through nuclear weapons and conventional capabilities. During the cold war, military planners aimed to punish the enemy in the event of an attack -- through retaliation, deny their enemy the ability to fulfil the objectives of a military strike -- through dispersion of targets, for example, and/or compel an enemy to desist from attacks -- through economic, political or military inducements. After the demise of the Soviet Union, deterrence continued to be a central part of NATO doctrine and was prominent in the 1991 Strategic Concept . Even in the post 9-11 era, NATO held on to this concept in confronting terrorism. The 2003 Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism, for example, was based on “... the assumption that it is preferable to deter terrorist attacks or to prevent their occurrence rather than deal with their consequences” . Deterrence was also absorbed into specific counterterrorist operations, such as Operation Active Endeavour, a naval exercise in the Mediterranean that was intended to “... deter, defend, disrupt and protect against terrorism” .\nBut NATO may not be so well placed to deter attacks in cyberspace. Tang Lan and Zhang Xin have argued that “the anonymity, the global reach, the scattered nature, and the interconnectedness of information networks greatly reduce the efficacy of cyber deterrence and can even render it completely useless” . Similarly, James Lewis has outlined how asymmetric vulnerabilities to attack, new classes of opponents with very different tolerance of risk, and the difficulty of crafting a proportional and credible threat, all erode the ability to deter in the cyber and space domains (2012 cited Anon 2012). A number of other weaknesses exist in the cyber deterrence framework. Nuclear weapons are capable of causing absolute devastation against a\npotential attacker. The possible scale and impact of cyber retaliation is, at least at current levels of cyber capabilities, far lower. Escalation is another option, whereby a cyber attack would be met by a conventional military response, such as a missile strike. These questions have been on NATO member's agendas. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan, for example, has said that, “A response to a cyber-incident or attack on the US would not necessarily be a cyber-response. All appropriate options would be on the table if we were attacked” (2011 cited Spillius 2011). However, if cyber attackers can remain anonymous, and continue to be free from any legal censure, and if NATO cannot reliably punish cyber attackers, deny the attackers the ability to mount attacks, or compel them to desist from mounting attacks in the first place, a NATO role in cyber security may not be an effective one.\nThese strategic issues are central to whether NATO can be an effective organisation in responding to the growing threat from cyber attacks and pose a number of important questions. Can NATO overcome the changing territorial dynamics of cyber security? Can attacks against NATO members be reliably attributed to specific actors? Can NATO deter cyber attacks?\n## NATO's institutional adaptation\nExplanations of NATO's evolving post-cold war role can be divided into three main theoretical camps. Realist and neorealist scholars have emphasised the continuity of external threats and have viewed the perpetuation of NATO as being based on the US desire to control and influence European members of the alliance . Institutionalist scholars have emphasised the adaptability of NATO to new security challenges and emphasised such concepts as path dependence and institutional “stickiness” as explaining NATO's perpetuation, which is to say that the adaptation of NATO structures has been seen as preferable to the reinvention/reestablishment of the alliance . Constructivist scholars have focused more on NATO's common identity as a community of democracies and the desire to expand that community to Central and Eastern Europe . Arguably, all three of these approaches are of utility in expanding NATO's emerging cyber security role. NATO members have consistently emphasised the threat from cyber attacks, and that the threat comes from state and state-supported actors (realism); there has been a concerted effort to adapt NATO's institutions, operations and doctrines to respond to cyber attacks (institutionalism); and cyber attacks cannot be separated from identity politics, even when the identity of cyber attackers is hard to establish (constructivism).\nThis section of the article combines insights from realist and institutional approaches to alliance transformation and argues that cyber threats have driven institutional change within NATO. In this respect, NATO has been under pressure to adjust its functions and design to deal with changing environmental demands . This process of evolution has taken place slowly and incrementally and has been only one facet of a broader adaptation on the part of the alliance to a diversifying and globalising security environment. It should also be noted that institutional adaptation is not a guarantee of effectiveness . Nevertheless, NATO's institutional strength and adaptability has made it a useful tool for dialogue, policy development and decision-making on cyber security within the Euro Atlantic area, and created opportunities for developing unified positions on the core issues.\nMore specifically, there appear to have been four drivers of this process of institutional evolution. First, NATO has taken steps to enhance its cyber security due to its operational experiences, including in Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan from 2003 and Libya in 2011. These conflicts have taken on a cyber dimension and NATO has had to incorporate cyber into strategic planning as a result. Second, the events of 9/11 created serious concerns within NATO over cyber terrorism (and terrorist use of the internet more broadly) and this has driven NATO's cyber security focus. Third, geostrategic rivalries with Russia and China have taken on an increasingly online dimension and NATO has responded accordingly. Fourth, the volume and severity of cyber attacks against NATO itself and its members has increased rapidly in the last decade. These changing dynamics have given NATO's political leaders incentives to enhance NATO's cyber security capabilities and created “triggers” for institutional change .\nCyber security first appeared on NATO's formal agenda at the 2002 Prague Summit, where NATO members committed to the “Initiation of measures to strengthen defence against cyber attacks” . This new focus stemmed from the conflict in Kosovo in 1999, where pro-Serbian hackers had targeted NATO communications infrastructure with a view to affecting its war fighting capabilities. A NATO website responsible for promoting NATO's role in the conflict was subjected to sustained DDoS attacks from Serbian hackers, and Chinese hackers targeted NATO members in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, leading to the White House website being taken offline for three days . The summit highlighted NATO's “ability to adjust to new priorities and to adapt its capabilities in order to meet new challenges” . This process of change was described as part of an “evolution” and was to occur “incrementally”, “on a continual and deliberate basis” . In a more concrete sense, the 2002 summit established an institutional capacity to respond to this growing concern. A NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) was formed and the NATO Cyber Defence Programme was established.\nNATO also took on a more active role in the fight against terrorism at this time. . The new commitment to cyber defence at the Prague summit was referred to as being part of a “package of measures ... to strengthen NATO's capabilities to defend against terrorism”  and was endorsed when the alliance was grappling with its response to 9/11, the US intervention in Afghanistan, in which several NATO members took an early lead role, and in the context of a changing US national security strategy that placed counterterrorism at its core. The US government was also instituting domestic reforms at this time that influenced the NATO process. In October 2001, the Bush administration signed the Patriot Act into law, which enhanced the government's domestic and foreign surveillance powers, established the National Electronic Crime Task Force, extended government powers to intercept and access electronic communications, and enhanced America's digital forensics capabilities. Perhaps most significantly, the Act included provisions for classifying computer crimes as acts of terrorism for the first time . Further to this, the Bush administration created the Office of Cyberspace Security in the White House and appointed prominent counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, to lead it. The newly created Department for Homeland Security was also given a statutory cyber security role. Tom Ridge, its first Director, highlighted the extent of the US government's concerns at this time: “Terrorists can sit at one computer connected to one network and can create worldwide havoc. [They] don't necessarily need a bomb or explosives to cripple a\nsector of the economy or shut down a power grid” (2003 cited Weimann 2004). This may have been an example of cyber security hyperbole, but the fear created by 9/11 and the prospect of terrorist groups developing sophisticated cyber attack capabilities were significant drivers of the US government's response to cyber security issues in the early post-9/11 period and influenced NATO's growing role in this area of policy.\nThe NATO summit in Riga in 2006 further endorsed the need to continue efforts to enhance NATO's cyber security and emphasis was placed on securing NATO's own information systems against cyber attack . Arguably, however, a broader NATO role in the cyber security of its members was still on the backburner. The 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, however, elevated the issue of cyber security within the alliance and shifted NATO's focus away from cyber terrorism to a focus on the threats posed by nation states and state-sponsored hackers. The attacks were thought to be a response to the removal of a monument to the Soviet liberation of Estonia, and took place over a sustained period of three weeks. All of the Estonian government's websites were shut down, along with the sites of two major banks, a number of political parties and three of the country's biggest news media organisations. From a strategic point of view, the attacks demonstrated a number of the problems outlined in the previous section, particularly the issue of attribution. The Estonian government accused the Russian government of instigating the attacks and saw Russia's refusal to participate in official investigations as confirming a level of culpability . NATO officials strongly suspected Russian state involvement, but found no direct evidence of a link. One NATO spokesperson said, “I won't point fingers. But these were not things done by a few individuals. This clearly bore the hallmarks of something concerted” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). The Estonian attacks also prompted a vigorous and prolonged internal debate within the alliance as to whether a cyber attack could form the basis of an Article 5 commitment. Estonia's defence Minister acknowledged that,“At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country. (2007 cited Traynor 2007)”\nHowever, the sustained cyber assault was widely viewed as a violation of Estonia's sovereignty and even an encroachment on its territorial integrity. As Linnar Viik, a consultant to the Estonian government, asserted, “... this is not some virtual world. This is part of our independence. And these attacks were an attempt to take one country back to the cave, back to the Stone Age” (2007 cited Finn 2007). Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip asked, “What's the difference between a blockade of harbours or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government institutions and newspaper websites?” (2007 cited Rid 2012b). NATO also recognised the severity of the problem, with one Brussels-based official stating: “This is an operational security issue, something we're taking very seriously. It goes to the heart of the alliance's modus operandi” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). In 2007, however, NATO was some way from establishing whether cyber attacks constituted an “armed attack” as stipulated in Article 5, and implementing a collective response to the attacks was problematic given the difficulty of attribution. Nevertheless, the incident formed the basis of a more unified alliance approach to cyber security and the development of enhanced capabilities .\nThe cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007 were not an isolated example of the evolving cyber threat. A number of other serious incidents raised the profile of cyber\nsecurity within NATO member states in late 2007 and 2008 and fuelled attention to strategic vulnerabilities within the transatlantic community. In August 2007, it was reported that Chinese hackers had broken into the networks of the German Chancellery and three other Berlin Ministries, and in November 2007 British intelligence agency MI5 stated that the PLA had been conducting a concerted campaign of cyber espionage against British businesses. In June 2008, Lithuania faced a barrage of cyber attacks after it vetoed an EU energy partnership deal with Russia. The Russian war against Georgia in August 2008 also featured Russian-based hackers using cyber attacks as a precursor to the invasion in order to create confusion among Georgian military units and government ministries and to prevent a coordinated response to the assault . Lastly, in November 2008, the US Pentagon issued a ban on all external hard drives after a USB drive was used by a foreign intelligence agency to upload spyware and data exfiltration software to Defence Department computers .\nThis growth in malicious cyber activity in 2007--2008 created a window of opportunity to develop multilateral mechanisms to respond to cyber security threats and various such measures were put in place over the course of 2008. In January that year, as a direct result of the Estonia attacks, NATO members endorsed a new Cyber Defence Policy, and in March the North Atlantic Council (NAC) established the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA). The CDMA aimed to integrate the alliance's cyber security functions and provide support for NATO members in the event of cyber attacks. A NATO spokesperson described the role of the centre as, “defence, whether an attack comes from state, criminal or other sources” (2008 cited Grant 2008). Later in 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was established in Tallinn, Estonia. While not part of the formal NATO command structure, the centre has taken a role in advancing NATO cyber security doctrine policy and developing cyber security capabilities. It has also helped to reduce alliance-wide transaction costs through the NATO “Smart Defence” initiative. Wallander (2000) has explained how highly institutionalised alliances like NATO create “assets” which help to sustain the alliance even as the security environment changes. The formation of these bodies should be seen in this context. They have provided mechanisms for the pooling of resources, avenues for negotiations between NATO members on cyber issues, enhanced decision-making within the alliance, and created incentives for all members to develop multilateral approaches to cyber security rather than isolated national ones.\nThe next major institutional development for NATO was the inclusion of cyber security in the November 2010 Strategic Concept, the third such Concept to be released in the post-cold war era. This was another important milestone for the alliance and a firm indication that NATO members considered cyber security to be an important area of focus. The concept emphasised “the next phase in NATO's evolution” and the need for “continuous reform” to meet modern security challenges . On cyber security specifically, it stated that cyber attacks were not just a national problem, but a collective threat to the “prosperity, security, and stability” of the whole of the Euro Atlantic area, recognising that such attacks were becoming, “more frequent, more organised and more costly in the damage that they inflict on government administrations, businesses, economies and potentially also transportation and supply networks and other critical infrastructure” . Interestingly, while the concept made reference to NATO's “ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyber-attacks” , the notion of deterrence was notably absent.\nNATO's institutional adaption to the threat of cyber attacks continued with the adoption of a revised Cyber Defence Policy in 2011, which placed emphasis on minimum\nrequirements for cyber defence of national networks and an integrated system of cyber governance within NATO, with the North Atlantic Council as the ultimate driver of NATO policy and cooperation in this area. The revised policy was another landmark in NATO's strategic thinking on cyber security, highlighted the need for pragmatic responses to cyber attacks (not being constrained by Article 5, for example), and recognised the importance of prevention of and resilience to attacks . The establishment of a Rapid Reaction Team in 2012 was also noteworthy. A team of six NATO computer experts were tasked with responding to cyber attacks in real time and re-establishing computer network functionality in the event of cyber attacks and/or network exploitation.\nA further notable contribution to NATO's adaptation to cyber security challenges was the publication of The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in March 2013. This document was produced by team of legal and technical experts working in conjunction with the CCD COE and aimed to codify and clarify possible responses to both the legal and strategic dilemmas around cyber attacks by apply existing international law to the cyber security arena. The document has advanced NATO's legal and strategic thinking on key cyber security issues, including on the problem of attribution, where it argues that states should bear some responsibility for cyber attacks emanating from within their jurisdiction. There are areas, however, that are underexplored in the document, including legal prohibitions on attacks that do not constitute a use of armed force and which take place outside of armed conflict (which still constitute the vast majority of cyber attacks), and kinetic-to-cyber operations, where conventional force might be used to destroy digital infrastructure .\nFinally, in September 2014, at its summit in Cardiff, NATO members endorsed the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy. In many ways, this was the culmination of the policy debate that was started within NATO by the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As a result of the policy, NATO will consider (and potentially implement) a collective Article 5 response to cyber attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. This landmark in NATO's cyber security evolution is not without its problems. Uncertainty remains as to how a collective response can be implemented when attribution is problematic, and it is not clear what threshold a cyber attack would need to meet to trigger an Article 5 response. Minor intrusions into NATO networks are clearly not what NATO policy-makers have in mind. However, cyber attacks with a severe impact on the economy, critical infrastructure and national security of NATO members may well fall into this category. As Jamie Shea, head of NATO's Emerging Security Challenges division, has stated: “We are keeping that ambiguous so a potential aggressor does not get the idea they can carry out cyber attacks up to a certain level with impunity” (2014 cited Washford 2014). It is also unclear what a collective cyber response by NATO would actually look like. NATO does not have the authority to implement sanctions against states for cyber attacks; digital retaliation is difficult although not impossible, as can be seen in the case of the (still unclaimed) attacks against North Korea in response to the Sony hack; and an attack using conventional force, which has not been ruled out, would clearly need to be proportional to the original offence. Nevertheless, 15 years after NATO first experienced cyber attacks, the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy had brought cyber security firmly inside the purview of NATO's evolving responsibilities. It has indicated that the alliance will respond deliberately and proportionally to any significant attack depending on the extent of the damage, the level of attribution, and the motives and identity of the attackers  (Table 2).\nDefence Studies 309\n# NATO's cyber security doctrine\nAlthough this institutional change has occurred incrementally, and has been driven by a diverse set of events and actors, cyber security appears to have found a foothold in NATO's doctrine for the defence of its members and for the general employment of NATO power in the post-cold war era. But what do these institutional developments tell us about NATO's collective cyber security doctrine? How do these capabilities, policies and institutions actually shape how NATO acts in cyberspace, and do they constitute a unified or uniform approach to cyber security across the transatlantic region?\nNATO's first priority has always been to defend the North Atlantic area, and, even though cyber threats emanate from cyberspace, the alliance's doctrine is still, for the most part, focused on the protection of its own computer networks. NATO's cyber command is centrally located in Brussels, where the CDMA and NCIRC provide coordination, real-time monitoring capabilities and intelligence sharing functions , and alliance officials are aware of the need to protect NATO's digital infrastructure spread across its many international sites. While NATO has taken a broader role in cyber defence as a result of the recent adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, its own operational security is paramount.\nSecond, NATO's cyber security doctrine and posture is still largely defensive. The alliance has not been involved in developing offensive cyber attack capabilities. These sorts of capabilities remain the purview of the national intelligence and security institutions of individual members. It may be that NATO's political and military command would be informed if a NATO member was involved in conducting offensive cyber security operations, especially if it was part of a wider NATO mission, but at the present time NATO's cyber command is not envisaged as having such a role.\nThird, although deterring cyber attacks is clearly not as straight forward as deterring conventional attacks from state actors, NATO cyber doctrine appears to be based in deterrence by denial. Given the difficulty of retaliating against cyber attackers and the inability to compel attackers to desist from attacks, denying them the ability to achieve their objectives has become the focus. NATO will make it as difficult as possible to infiltrate its systems and make sure hackers are aware that they are unlikely to be able to achieve their intended effects (Healey and van Bochoven 2012). Jamie Shea has recently highlighted the utility of this defensive posture .\nTable 2. The institutional development of NATO's cyber security role.\n|  1999 | Cyber attacks directed against NATO during the Kosovo conflict  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  2002 | Prague summit – Cyber security appears on NATO’s formal agenda for the first time.

While NATO has clearly been influenced by the diffusion of power and influence away from the state in the post-cold war era, and particularly threats from terrorist groups and non-affiliated hackers, concerns about Russia and China have contributed to a revised sense of state adversaries during this period. Despite NATO's preponderance of power in other areas, its strategic rivals have proved highly capable in the cyber security arena. General Keith Alexander, head of the US Cyber Command, has described Russia as a “near peer” in terms of its cyber capabilities (2010 cited Giles 2011) and Giles (2011, p. 54) has argued both China's and Russia's emphasis on semi-autonomous agencies in cyber security operations gives them a distinct advantage over the US and its allies. Russian and Chinese-based hackers have regularly targeted NATO's networks in response to political disputes, most recently in response to NATO's stance on the Ukraine crisis , and both countries have an interest in exfiltrating the confidential, operational, strategic and political information that flows through NATO networks. Although some attempts have been made to enhance cyber security cooperation between NATO and Russia, such as dialogue at the NATO-Russia Council level , the Russian annexation of Crimea and on-going efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine, which have taken place alongside new cyber attacks against NATO members, have put any meaningful cooperation on cyber issues on hold. The US Justice Department's indictment of five member of the PLA in May 2014 has similarly stalled any attempt to cooperate with China on cyber issues .\nLastly, as with many other areas of NATO's security doctrine, NATO's approach to cyber security is based around developing cooperative relationships, both internally and externally. NATO has developed a range of formal partnerships in the post-cold war era that are increasingly addressing cyber security issues, including the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI), the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). Cyber Security is increasingly a component of the Individual Partnership Action Plans (IPAPs) negotiated with countries around the world, such as New Zealand, and NATO has developed enhanced links with the private sector and critical infrastructure providers in advancing cyber defence in the North Atlantic area . These diverse networks of partnerships allow for global cooperation on cyber security issues and help to develop cyber security norms, standards and capabilities. In this respect, NATO's cyber security doctrine covers and is part of each of its three main operational pillars: Crisis Management (e.g. the crisis surrounding the cyber attacks against Estonian in 2007), Collective Defence (e.g. the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy) and Cooperative Security.\n## A transatlantic divide?\nNATO has frequently been beset by intra-alliance tensions and in the cyber security arena there appears to be at least some evidence of a divergence in European and US policy approaches. Recent revelations by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, for example, have exposed transatlantic tensions around surveillance, and the alleged NSA hacking of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, which led to an angry phone call between Obama and Merkel and the summoning of the US Ambassador to Germany, was a major embarrassment for the US government . The US has arguably taken a harder security stance on cyber issues since 9/11 because of its desire to protect the US homeland, and because it faces increased strategic rivalry from rival global\npower centres. A more aggressive cyber posture can certainly be seen in the establishment of the US Cyber Command, a unified and expanding military command structure tasked with coordinating defensive and offensive cyber operations for all branches of the US military, the deployment of the Stuxnet software against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the Patriot Act, and the mass surveillance programmes run by the NSA, including the Prism programme. The use of offensive and even pre-emptive operations by the US government has also grown in recent years, with a high number of ICT specialists employed to penetrate foreign networks . In 2012, Obama signed Presidential Decision Directive 20, a classified document that gave the US military the authority to conduct more aggressive cyber operations to thwart cyber attacks against US systems .\nThe wealth of cyber resources and capabilities that exist within the US military and associated agencies may be a reason in and of itself why the US approach to managing cyber conflict has been dominated by that branch of the US government. Mary O Connell takes up this line of argument, suggesting that the US government has become “trapped in an ideology of militarism”  and claiming that “the US military today has the largest concentration of expertise and legal authority with respect to cyberspace” . She further notes that in 2009, following the Estonia attacks, the Russia Georgia war and the release of the Stuxnet virus, the US government “began releasing a number of policies on cyber security that were predominantly military in orientation” . This would seem to support the line of argument advanced by this article, that threats from state rather than non-state actors explain the elevation of cyber security as an issue within the transatlantic security community.\nThis hard power approach to cyber security in the US could also be explained by the rhetoric being used to describe cyber attacks in the American context. Former Defence Secretary Leon Panetta's claim that the US could face a “cyber Pearl Harbour” is a prime example of the securitisation and militarisation of cyber discourse. When there is a propensity at the highest levels of government to adopt Second World War and cold war analogies to characterise cyber conflict, this can shape US policy and doctrine in a certain direction. Shachtman and Singer (2011) argue that clear links can be found between cold war strategic thinking and the formulation of current US policy, especially the idea that cyber attacks might be met with conventional attacks; an idea “lifted” from the 1960s strategy of flexible response. Commercial and political motives might also have led to the US taking a more military-based approach to cyber security issues. They further argue that “there is a massive amount of threat inflation going on in Washington's discussion of online dangers, most frequently by those with political or profit motives in hyping the threats” Shachtman and Singer (2011). While we should be careful in suggesting that a new “cyber industrial complex” is forming in America, the huge US government spending on cyber protection for the federal government, such as a $1 billion contract awarded to Raytheon by the Department for Homeland Security in 2015, may create incentives for responses to cyber security threats to be militarised. Equally, threat inflation may displace attention from the arguably more pervasive problem of cyber crime.\nIn Europe, at least on the surface, a softer cyber security approach is evident. EU responses to cyber security have typically emphasised criminal and civil procedures for dealing with cyber attacks, reflecting a European preference for soft power over hard power, and there has been a broader reluctance in Europe to militarise cyberspace. The new European Union Cyber Security Strategy, for example, is based on promoting\nnorms in cyberspace, encouraging dialogue between nations, enhancing technical capacity and resilience, and fighting cybercrime . The most controversial aspect has been the requirement for businesses in Europe, and particularly critical infrastructure providers, to report cyber attacks to a central authority. Overall though, the strategy is defensively orientated and non-militaristic.\nThe level of transatlantic divergence on cyber security issues should not be overstated, however. Given the impact of 9/11 on the US national security establishment, it is not surprising that the balance in America has tilted towards security over privacy in the decade or so since the attacks. In the context of the rise of China, the US pivot to Asia and an increasingly assertive Russia, the US is also bound to have an interest in staying ahead of its state competitors in cyber space. The US has shown some restraint in the use of its cyber capabilities and a recognisable commitment to the emergence of normative constraints on cyber warfare. Offensive cyber attacks were considered by the Obama administration as part of the campaign against Colonel Gadhafi's Libya in 2011, but a reluctance to set a dangerous precedent in how wars are fought, as well as a degree of concern over securing Congressional support for such strategy, meant that the campaign was limited to conventional capabilities . The Obama administration has also announced plans to end mass surveillance programmes and has stated that the US will cease monitoring the personal communications of European leaders.\nWithin Europe there are also certain states that are moving closer to the US in developing harder cyber security capabilities, and doing so outside of the NATO framework. The UK government, for example, has taken steps to merge cyber security intelligence and military operations, and the French and German militaries are both developing offensive cyber capabilities . As previously stated, while there has been no NATO-led process for offensive cyber security, NATO's leading powers, including the US, are pursuing similar strategies domestically.\nCommon interests, values and threats also continue to bind American and European approaches to cyber security together. Both sides of the Atlantic advocate an open and accessible global cyber commons with minimal government restrictions, and an open internet is seen by both sides as central to driving economic growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Americans and Europeans are also unified in their approach to fighting cyber crime and securing critical infrastructure . This general approach stands in opposition to Russia and China, who are arguably more concerned with being able to control information that could destabilise their societies and who have argued for international rights to restrict and censor internet traffic on that basis . While this divide may be hindering wider international cooperation, it is evidence of a level of unity on the basic issues within the transatlantic area.\nIntra-alliance management of cyber security issues also remains an important area of focus for the NATO allies, not least because some NATO members are clearly more concerned about cyber security than others. Estonia, the NATO member victim to the most significant attacks on its critical infrastructure, does not have the same level of cyber security concerns as Portugal, for example. But this is not necessarily an impediment to a NATO cyber security role, especially as NATO members have tended to specialise and develop niche capabilities that benefit the wider membership. Perhaps now more than ever NATO's capability aggregation role -- amassing capabilities against a common threat -- and its role in facilitating “smart defence”, are of crucial importance . Former Secretary General Rasmussen emphasised this himself in 2011, saying that “Smart defence is about building security for less money by working\ntogether and being more flexible” . In an environment where NATO members' defence budgets are under strain, and where the US is concerned about a lack of European Defence spending, specialisation within the alliance will be increasingly important. NATO's Cyber Security Centre of Excellence is an example of this concept in practice, where some NATO members (Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Spain) have invested in a valuable institutional resource that is beneficial to all members. Defence cooperation creates efficiencies and lowers transaction costs; this is being achieved through NATO's institutional frameworks and potentially lowering the scope for intra-alliance divides.\n## Conclusion\nWhile NATO has tried to come to terms with some of the strategic challenges involved in enhancing the cyber security of its members, there are still some unresolved and perhaps unresolvable cyber security issues. Reliably attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, responding to the diversity of actors involved and deterring cyber attacks, for example, will continue to be difficult and possibly intractable problems. NATO appears so far to have accepted this and adopted a cyber security posture that is pragmatic and deals with attacks on a case by case basis. Its defensive role, based around deterrence by denial, is appropriate given the reluctance to use the alliance for offensive cyber purposes, and its focus is in areas where it has a clear and compelling political and strategic interest; in cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and cyber warfare.\nThe defence of NATO's own digital networks continues to be of paramount importance. However, there is some evidence that the alliance is taking a wider and deeper role in cyber security in the North Atlantic area. The adoption of an Article 5 approach to cyber attacks is foremost in this regard, but the efforts that have been made to forge private sector partnerships and to develop normative and legal mechanisms for cyber security are also significant. Ultimately, cyber security remains a national responsibility for NATO members.\nWhat is perhaps most remarkable about how NATO has adapted to cyber security challenges is the institutional capacity the alliance has put in place. This institutional development has been driven mostly by external threats, from terrorist groups initially, but most recently by state actors, and these have accelerated the political and institutional focus on cyber security within the alliance. The alliance's integrated military command has always been one of its most important institutional assets and has historically allowed NATO members to coordinate military operations. The political integration and coordination provided by the North Atlantic Council has also been noteworthy throughout alliance history. In a similar vein, NATO now has a common cyber security capacity through which members can coordinate responses to cyber security incidents and provide channels of communication that are likely to continue to be important as cyber threats evolve.\nTransatlantic tensions on cyber security issues are certainly in evidence, and these stem from broader tensions between the US and Europe over the response to 9/11 and the role of the internet in surveillance. Despite this, there is a considerable degree of unity on the core cyber security challenges within the NATO membership. The balance between privacy and security will continue to be debated within NATO member states, but at this stage, this does not appear to be inhibiting a common and unified approach to at least defensive cyber operations. Whether NATO will take on an offensive cyber security posture at some stage will be an issue to monitor. The requirements of\nimplementing an Article 5 response to a major cyber attack might provide momentum for the development of offensive capabilities to be deployed as part of a unified NATO command, but it is more likely that NATO's most prominent players will continue to develop and deploy these kinds of capabilities outside of NATO channels.\nFinally, it is worth returning to NATO's core functions: collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. In all these areas, a NATO cyber security role would appear to have considerable merit. Global security challenges invariably require multilateral solutions and NATO has a range of adaptable institutional capabilities that are reasonably well suited to the task at hand.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

  "payload": "## ## NATO's institutional adaptation\n\nExplanations of NATO's evolving post-cold war role can be divided into three main theoretical camps. Realist and neorealist scholars have emphasised the continuity of external threats and have viewed the perpetuation of NATO as being based on the US desire to control and influence European members of the alliance . Institutionalist scholars have emphasised the adaptability of NATO to new security challenges and emphasised such concepts as path dependence and institutional “stickiness” as explaining NATO's perpetuation, which is to say that the adaptation of NATO structures has been seen as preferable to the reinvention/reestablishment of the alliance . Constructivist scholars have focused more on NATO's common identity as a community of democracies and the desire to expand that community to Central and Eastern Europe . Arguably, all three of these approaches are of utility in expanding NATO's emerging cyber security role. NATO members have consistently emphasised the threat from cyber attacks, and that the threat comes from state and state-supported actors (realism); there has been a concerted effort to adapt NATO's institutions, operations and doctrines to respond to cyber attacks (institutionalism); and cyber attacks cannot be separated from identity politics, even when the identity of cyber attackers is hard to establish (constructivism).\nThis section of the article combines insights from realist and institutional approaches to alliance transformation and argues that cyber threats have driven institutional change within NATO. In this respect, NATO has been under pressure to adjust its functions and design to deal with changing environmental demands . This process of evolution has taken place slowly and incrementally and has been only one facet of a broader adaptation on the part of the alliance to a diversifying and globalising security environment. It should also be noted that institutional adaptation is not a guarantee of effectiveness . Nevertheless, NATO's institutional strength and adaptability has made it a useful tool for dialogue, policy development and decision-making on cyber security within the Euro Atlantic area, and created opportunities for developing unified positions on the core issues.\nMore specifically, there appear to have been four drivers of this process of institutional evolution. First, NATO has taken steps to enhance its cyber security due to its operational experiences, including in Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan from 2003 and Libya in 2011. These conflicts have taken on a cyber dimension and NATO has had to incorporate cyber into strategic planning as a result. Second, the events of 9/11 created serious concerns within NATO over cyber terrorism (and terrorist use of the internet more broadly) and this has driven NATO's cyber security focus. Third, geostrategic rivalries with Russia and China have taken on an increasingly online dimension and NATO has responded accordingly. Fourth, the volume and severity of cyber attacks against NATO itself and its members has increased rapidly in the last decade. These changing dynamics have given NATO's political leaders incentives to enhance NATO's cyber security capabilities and created “triggers” for institutional change .\nCyber security first appeared on NATO's formal agenda at the 2002 Prague Summit, where NATO members committed to the “Initiation of measures to strengthen defence against cyber attacks” . This new focus stemmed from the conflict in Kosovo in 1999, where pro-Serbian hackers had targeted NATO communications infrastructure with a view to affecting its war fighting capabilities. A NATO website responsible for promoting NATO's role in the conflict was subjected to sustained DDoS attacks from Serbian hackers, and Chinese hackers targeted NATO members in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, leading to the White House website being taken offline for three days . The summit highlighted NATO's “ability to adjust to new priorities and to adapt its capabilities in order to meet new challenges” . This process of change was described as part of an “evolution” and was to occur “incrementally”, “on a continual and deliberate basis” . In a more concrete sense, the 2002 summit established an institutional capacity to respond to this growing concern. A NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) was formed and the NATO Cyber Defence Programme was established.\nNATO also took on a more active role in the fight against terrorism at this time. . The new commitment to cyber defence at the Prague summit was referred to as being part of a “package of measures ... to strengthen NATO's capabilities to defend against terrorism”  and was endorsed when the alliance was grappling with its response to 9/11, the US intervention in Afghanistan, in which several NATO members took an early lead role, and in the context of a changing US national security strategy that placed counterterrorism at its core. The US government was also instituting domestic reforms at this time that influenced the NATO process. In October 2001, the Bush administration signed the Patriot Act into law, which enhanced the government's domestic and foreign surveillance powers, established the National Electronic Crime Task Force, extended government powers to intercept and access electronic communications, and enhanced America's digital forensics capabilities. Perhaps most significantly, the Act included provisions for classifying computer crimes as acts of terrorism for the first time . Further to this, the Bush administration created the Office of Cyberspace Security in the White House and appointed prominent counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, to lead it. The newly created Department for Homeland Security was also given a statutory cyber security role. Tom Ridge, its first Director, highlighted the extent of the US government's concerns at this time: “Terrorists can sit at one computer connected to one network and can create worldwide havoc. [They] don't necessarily need a bomb or explosives to cripple a\nsector of the economy or shut down a power grid” (2003 cited Weimann 2004). This may have been an example of cyber security hyperbole, but the fear created by 9/11 and the prospect of terrorist groups developing sophisticated cyber attack capabilities were significant drivers of the US government's response to cyber security issues in the early post-9/11 period and influenced NATO's growing role in this area of policy.\nThe NATO summit in Riga in 2006 further endorsed the need to continue efforts to enhance NATO's cyber security and emphasis was placed on securing NATO's own information systems against cyber attack . Arguably, however, a broader NATO role in the cyber security of its members was still on the backburner. The 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, however, elevated the issue of cyber security within the alliance and shifted NATO's focus away from cyber terrorism to a focus on the threats posed by nation states and state-sponsored hackers. The attacks were thought to be a response to the removal of a monument to the Soviet liberation of Estonia, and took place over a sustained period of three weeks. All of the Estonian government's websites were shut down, along with the sites of two major banks, a number of political parties and three of the country's biggest news media organisations. From a strategic point of view, the attacks demonstrated a number of the problems outlined in the previous section, particularly the issue of attribution. The Estonian government accused the Russian government of instigating the attacks and saw Russia's refusal to participate in official investigations as confirming a level of culpability . NATO officials strongly suspected Russian state involvement, but found no direct evidence of a link. One NATO spokesperson said, “I won't point fingers. But these were not things done by a few individuals. This clearly bore the hallmarks of something concerted” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). The Estonian attacks also prompted a vigorous and prolonged internal debate within the alliance as to whether a cyber attack could form the basis of an Article 5 commitment. Estonia's defence Minister acknowledged that,“At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country. (2007 cited Traynor 2007)”\nHowever, the sustained cyber assault was widely viewed as a violation of Estonia's sovereignty and even an encroachment on its territorial integrity. As Linnar Viik, a consultant to the Estonian government, asserted, “... this is not some virtual world. This is part of our independence. And these attacks were an attempt to take one country back to the cave, back to the Stone Age” (2007 cited Finn 2007). Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip asked, “What's the difference between a blockade of harbours or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government institutions and newspaper websites?” (2007 cited Rid 2012b). NATO also recognised the severity of the problem, with one Brussels-based official stating: “This is an operational security issue, something we're taking very seriously. It goes to the heart of the alliance's modus operandi” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). In 2007, however, NATO was some way from establishing whether cyber attacks constituted an “armed attack” as stipulated in Article 5, and implementing a collective response to the attacks was problematic given the difficulty of attribution. Nevertheless, the incident formed the basis of a more unified alliance approach to cyber security and the development of enhanced capabilities .\nThe cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007 were not an isolated example of the evolving cyber threat. A number of other serious incidents raised the profile of cyber\nsecurity within NATO member states in late 2007 and 2008 and fuelled attention to strategic vulnerabilities within the transatlantic community. In August 2007, it was reported that Chinese hackers had broken into the networks of the German Chancellery and three other Berlin Ministries, and in November 2007 British intelligence agency MI5 stated that the PLA had been conducting a concerted campaign of cyber espionage against British businesses. In June 2008, Lithuania faced a barrage of cyber attacks after it vetoed an EU energy partnership deal with Russia. The Russian war against Georgia in August 2008 also featured Russian-based hackers using cyber attacks as a precursor to the invasion in order to create confusion among Georgian military units and government ministries and to prevent a coordinated response to the assault . Lastly, in November 2008, the US Pentagon issued a ban on all external hard drives after a USB drive was used by a foreign intelligence agency to upload spyware and data exfiltration software to Defence Department computers .\nThis growth in malicious cyber activity in 2007--2008 created a window of opportunity to develop multilateral mechanisms to respond to cyber security threats and various such measures were put in place over the course of 2008. In January that year, as a direct result of the Estonia attacks, NATO members endorsed a new Cyber Defence Policy, and in March the North Atlantic Council (NAC) established the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA). The CDMA aimed to integrate the alliance's cyber security functions and provide support for NATO members in the event of cyber attacks. A NATO spokesperson described the role of the centre as, “defence, whether an attack comes from state, criminal or other sources” (2008 cited Grant 2008). Later in 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was established in Tallinn, Estonia. While not part of the formal NATO command structure, the centre has taken a role in advancing NATO cyber security doctrine policy and developing cyber security capabilities. It has also helped to reduce alliance-wide transaction costs through the NATO “Smart Defence” initiative. Wallander (2000) has explained how highly institutionalised alliances like NATO create “assets” which help to sustain the alliance even as the security environment changes. The formation of these bodies should be seen in this context. They have provided mechanisms for the pooling of resources, avenues for negotiations between NATO members on cyber issues, enhanced decision-making within the alliance, and created incentives for all members to develop multilateral approaches to cyber security rather than isolated national ones.\nThe next major institutional development for NATO was the inclusion of cyber security in the November 2010 Strategic Concept, the third such Concept to be released in the post-cold war era. This was another important milestone for the alliance and a firm indication that NATO members considered cyber security to be an important area of focus. The concept emphasised “the next phase in NATO's evolution” and the need for “continuous reform” to meet modern security challenges . On cyber security specifically, it stated that cyber attacks were not just a national problem, but a collective threat to the “prosperity, security, and stability” of the whole of the Euro Atlantic area, recognising that such attacks were becoming, “more frequent, more organised and more costly in the damage that they inflict on government administrations, businesses, economies and potentially also transportation and supply networks and other critical infrastructure” . Interestingly, while the concept made reference to NATO's “ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyber-attacks” , the notion of deterrence was notably absent.\nNATO's institutional adaption to the threat of cyber attacks continued with the adoption of a revised Cyber Defence Policy in 2011, which placed emphasis on minimum\nrequirements for cyber defence of national networks and an integrated system of cyber governance within NATO, with the North Atlantic Council as the ultimate driver of NATO policy and cooperation in this area. The revised policy was another landmark in NATO's strategic thinking on cyber security, highlighted the need for pragmatic responses to cyber attacks (not being constrained by Article 5, for example), and recognised the importance of prevention of and resilience to attacks . The establishment of a Rapid Reaction Team in 2012 was also noteworthy. A team of six NATO computer experts were tasked with responding to cyber attacks in real time and re-establishing computer network functionality in the event of cyber attacks and/or network exploitation.\nA further notable contribution to NATO's adaptation to cyber security challenges was the publication of The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in March 2013. This document was produced by team of legal and technical experts working in conjunction with the CCD COE and aimed to codify and clarify possible responses to both the legal and strategic dilemmas around cyber attacks by apply existing international law to the cyber security arena. The document has advanced NATO's legal and strategic thinking on key cyber security issues, including on the problem of attribution, where it argues that states should bear some responsibility for cyber attacks emanating from within their jurisdiction. There are areas, however, that are underexplored in the document, including legal prohibitions on attacks that do not constitute a use of armed force and which take place outside of armed conflict (which still constitute the vast majority of cyber attacks), and kinetic-to-cyber operations, where conventional force might be used to destroy digital infrastructure .\nFinally, in September 2014, at its summit in Cardiff, NATO members endorsed the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy. In many ways, this was the culmination of the policy debate that was started within NATO by the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As a result of the policy, NATO will consider (and potentially implement) a collective Article 5 response to cyber attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. This landmark in NATO's cyber security evolution is not without its problems. Uncertainty remains as to how a collective response can be implemented when attribution is problematic, and it is not clear what threshold a cyber attack would need to meet to trigger an Article 5 response. Minor intrusions into NATO networks are clearly not what NATO policy-makers have in mind. However, cyber attacks with a severe impact on the economy, critical infrastructure and national security of NATO members may well fall into this category. As Jamie Shea, head of NATO's Emerging Security Challenges division, has stated: “We are keeping that ambiguous so a potential aggressor does not get the idea they can carry out cyber attacks up to a certain level with impunity” (2014 cited Washford 2014). It is also unclear what a collective cyber response by NATO would actually look like. NATO does not have the authority to implement sanctions against states for cyber attacks; digital retaliation is difficult although not impossible, as can be seen in the case of the (still unclaimed) attacks against North Korea in response to the Sony hack; and an attack using conventional force, which has not been ruled out, would clearly need to be proportional to the original offence. Nevertheless, 15 years after NATO first experienced cyber attacks, the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy had brought cyber security firmly inside the purview of NATO's evolving responsibilities. It has indicated that the alliance will respond deliberately and proportionally to any significant attack depending on the extent of the damage, the level of attribution, and the motives and identity of the attackers  (Table 2).\nDefence Studies 309\nAlthough this institutional change has occurred incrementally, and has been driven by a diverse set of events and actors, cyber security appears to have found a foothold in NATO's doctrine for the defence of its members and for the general employment of NATO power in the post-cold war era. But what do these institutional developments tell us about NATO's collective cyber security doctrine? How do these capabilities, policies and institutions actually shape how NATO acts in cyberspace, and do they constitute a unified or uniform approach to cyber security across the transatlantic region?\nNATO's first priority has always been to defend the North Atlantic area, and, even though cyber threats emanate from cyberspace, the alliance's doctrine is still, for the most part, focused on the protection of its own computer networks. NATO's cyber command is centrally located in Brussels, where the CDMA and NCIRC provide coordination, real-time monitoring capabilities and intelligence sharing functions , and alliance officials are aware of the need to protect NATO's digital infrastructure spread across its many international sites. While NATO has taken a broader role in cyber defence as a result of the recent adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, its own operational security is paramount.\nSecond, NATO's cyber security doctrine and posture is still largely defensive. The alliance has not been involved in developing offensive cyber attack capabilities. These sorts of capabilities remain the purview of the national intelligence and security institutions of individual members. It may be that NATO's political and military command would be informed if a NATO member was involved in conducting offensive cyber security operations, especially if it was part of a wider NATO mission, but at the present time NATO's cyber command is not envisaged as having such a role.\nThird, although deterring cyber attacks is clearly not as straight forward as deterring conventional attacks from state actors, NATO cyber doctrine appears to be based in deterrence by denial. Given the difficulty of retaliating against cyber attackers and the inability to compel attackers to desist from attacks, denying them the ability to achieve their objectives has become the focus. NATO will make it as difficult as possible to infiltrate its systems and make sure hackers are aware that they are unlikely to be able to achieve their intended effects (Healey and van Bochoven 2012). Jamie Shea has recently highlighted the utility of this defensive posture .\nTable 2. The institutional development of NATO's cyber security role.\n|  1999 | Cyber attacks directed against NATO during the Kosovo conflict  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  2002 | Prague summit – Cyber security appears on NATO’s formal agenda for the first time.

While NATO has clearly been influenced by the diffusion of power and influence away from the state in the post-cold war era, and particularly threats from terrorist groups and non-affiliated hackers, concerns about Russia and China have contributed to a revised sense of state adversaries during this period. Despite NATO's preponderance of power in other areas, its strategic rivals have proved highly capable in the cyber security arena. General Keith Alexander, head of the US Cyber Command, has described Russia as a “near peer” in terms of its cyber capabilities (2010 cited Giles 2011) and Giles (2011, p. 54) has argued both China's and Russia's emphasis on semi-autonomous agencies in cyber security operations gives them a distinct advantage over the US and its allies. Russian and Chinese-based hackers have regularly targeted NATO's networks in response to political disputes, most recently in response to NATO's stance on the Ukraine crisis , and both countries have an interest in exfiltrating the confidential, operational, strategic and political information that flows through NATO networks. Although some attempts have been made to enhance cyber security cooperation between NATO and Russia, such as dialogue at the NATO-Russia Council level , the Russian annexation of Crimea and on-going efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine, which have taken place alongside new cyber attacks against NATO members, have put any meaningful cooperation on cyber issues on hold. The US Justice Department's indictment of five member of the PLA in May 2014 has similarly stalled any attempt to cooperate with China on cyber issues .\nLastly, as with many other areas of NATO's security doctrine, NATO's approach to cyber security is based around developing cooperative relationships, both internally and externally. NATO has developed a range of formal partnerships in the post-cold war era that are increasingly addressing cyber security issues, including the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI), the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). Cyber Security is increasingly a component of the Individual Partnership Action Plans (IPAPs) negotiated with countries around the world, such as New Zealand, and NATO has developed enhanced links with the private sector and critical infrastructure providers in advancing cyber defence in the North Atlantic area . These diverse networks of partnerships allow for global cooperation on cyber security issues and help to develop cyber security norms, standards and capabilities. In this respect, NATO's cyber security doctrine covers and is part of each of its three main operational pillars: Crisis Management (e.g. the crisis surrounding the cyber attacks against Estonian in 2007), Collective Defence (e.g. the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy) and Cooperative Security.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusion\n\nWhile NATO has tried to come to terms with some of the strategic challenges involved in enhancing the cyber security of its members, there are still some unresolved and perhaps unresolvable cyber security issues. Reliably attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, responding to the diversity of actors involved and deterring cyber attacks, for example, will continue to be difficult and possibly intractable problems. NATO appears so far to have accepted this and adopted a cyber security posture that is pragmatic and deals with attacks on a case by case basis. Its defensive role, based around deterrence by denial, is appropriate given the reluctance to use the alliance for offensive cyber purposes, and its focus is in areas where it has a clear and compelling political and strategic interest; in cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and cyber warfare.\nThe defence of NATO's own digital networks continues to be of paramount importance. However, there is some evidence that the alliance is taking a wider and deeper role in cyber security in the North Atlantic area. The adoption of an Article 5 approach to cyber attacks is foremost in this regard, but the efforts that have been made to forge private sector partnerships and to develop normative and legal mechanisms for cyber security are also significant.

    "# NATO's cyber defence: strategic challenges and institutional adaptation\n\nJoe Burton\n\n[^1]: Abstract\n\nPolitical Science and International Relations Programme, Victoria University of Wellington, PO Box 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand\n\n(Received 23 February 2015; final version received 14 August 2015)\n\nNATO's adaptation in the post-cold war era has included a growing role in responding to cyber attacks. This article explores the definitional and theoretical problems in analysing the emerging cyber security field and seeks to provide an outline of the main strategic challenges that cyber attacks pose for NATO. The article evaluates the institutional structures and processes put in place by NATO to confront cyber threats and moves on to explore the extent of transatlantic unity around NATO's emerging doctrine for cyber defence. It is argued that NATO's response to cyber security is rooted in its prior adaptation to the changing security environment of the 1990s and the threat from international terrorism post 9-11. More recently, cyber attacks from state and state-sponsored actors have given impetus to NATO's emerging cyber security doctrine. The article finds that despite recent controversies over cyber surveillance, there is a considerable degree of unity within the alliance on the main cyber security issues. As a multilateral security organisation with a strong institutional foundation, NATO is also relatively well placed to respond to rapidly evolving cyber threats.\n\nKeywords: NATO; cyber defence; cyber security; strategy; institutional adaptation\n\nEver since its formation in 1949, NATO has gone through a sustained process of evolution, adding new members, new partners and new institutional capabilities. Now that the long and arduous ISAF mission in Afghanistan has formally ended, and in the context of a host of new security challenges -- including a newly assertive Russia, widespread instability across the Middle East and North Africa, and increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region -- the alliance must continue to adapt in order to stay relevant in a volatile and unpredictable security environment. One area of growing focus in this context is cyber security. This rapidly evolving security field featured prominently in NATO's 2010 Strategic Concept (NATO 2010a) and the alliance has invested considerable resources in enhancing its cyber capabilities and securing its networks against what former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has called an “exponentially increasing volume and sophistication of malicious cyber activity” (2013). In September 2014, at the NATO summit in Cardiff, NATO took a big step forward, recognising for the first time that cyber attacks against its members could prompt a collective response",
    "under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty (Rasmussen 2014). This enhanced Cyber Defence Policy put cyber security at the heart of NATO's operational outlook. The much-publicised cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in December 2014 have further heightened attention to cyber threats within the transatlantic community and provoked new sanctions against North Korean officials (Sanger et al. 2014).\n\nDespite advances in NATO's cyber security posture, unresolved tensions exist within the NATO membership on cyber security issues. Recent revelations by Edward Snowden relating to the US government's mass surveillance programmes, the development of offensive cyber capabilities within the US intelligence and defence community, and the willingness to deploy “cyber weapons” for strategic gain, as in the case of the Stuxnet attack against Iran, indicate that America may be intent on aggressively maximising its power in cyberspace. In contrast, in many European states, and within the European Union (EU) in particular, the current approach appears to be based on softer forms of cyber power, including the development of defensive capabilities, civil and criminal mechanisms, cyber security norms and legal frameworks (European Commission 2013). In addition to this apparent political divergence, NATO is only beginning to adapt to strategically different cyber security issues. A geographically located and focused alliance is now having to deal with a virtual realm through which malicious code can be deployed instantaneously from anywhere on the planet. Accurately identifying who is responsible for cyber attacks, responding to them and even preventing them, also appears to be considerably more difficult in cyberspace than in the physical world. The rapidly growing technological sophistication of malware, moreover, is such that NATO and its members are at risk of being permanently behind the cyber security curve.\n\nIn the context of these political and strategic challenges, this article seeks to establish and explore the parameters of NATO's cyber security role. Specifically, it asks whether NATO can be an effective cyber security actor and whether progress has been made in forging a unified transatlantic approach to cyber security issues. The article proceeds in three stages. First, it explores how cyber attacks are challenging traditional conceptualisations of security issues and identifies different categories of cyber security where a NATO role is developing. It is argued that NATO is focused primarily on defending its own digital networks, but that it is also forging a broader role in defending NATO members against cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. Second, the article charts the development of an institutional and policy focus on cyber security within the alliance from the early cyber attacks against NATO by Serbian hackers in 1999 through to the adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy in September 2014. In particular, this section highlights how the threat of acts of cyber terrorism in the post 9/11 security environment gave NATO impetus to invest in this area of security, but that in recent years, threats from NATO's more traditional adversaries, Russia and China, have driven policy. Third, the article explores NATO's emerging collective cyber security doctrine and reflects on how well-suited the alliance is to respond to the many political and strategic challenges posed by online threats. The article finds that differences between NATO members on cyber security, which stem from broader disputes over the response to international terrorism after 9/11, are not insurmountable. In fact, NATO's ability to refine its institutional, operational and political capabilities, as well as the ongoing need for multilateral responses to cyber threats, makes the alliance a valuable asset to its members.",
    "Cyber security -- conceptual and strategic challenges\n\nThe definitional and conceptual challenges of the cyber realm are something that scholars have struggled with fairly continuously since “cyber security” entered the popular lexicon. As Laasme (2011, p. 61) has stated:“Even though it might not be NATO's mission to classify and define everything in cyber-space, it is the alliance's role to prevent crises, manage conflicts, and defend one another against attacks, including against new threats -- none of which can be conducted with vague directions and abstruse concepts.”\n\nThis applies in the same way to the study of cyber security issues. Some conceptual clarity is required.\n\nCyber security, at its most basic level, is about being secure from (a) cyber attacks -- efforts to disrupt, delay or destroy computer networks, and (b) cyber exploitation -- efforts to covertly obtain information from computer networks (Lin 2012, p. 48). These attacks can take a number of different forms, and new tools for cyber intrusion are constantly being developed. One of the most common forms of malicious online activity are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are aimed at crippling a target's ability to operate web-based content and communications by bombarding it with “packets” of information. Perhaps the most prominent example of such an attack was against Estonian government ministries and media outlets in 2007 in reaction to the dismantling of a Soviet memorial in Tallinn. Malicious viruses can also be sent to networked computers to render them inoperable and to destroy information stored on them. On the cyber exploitation side, “phishing” attacks are common. These involve an unwitting target clicking on a link in an email or a webpage which covertly downloads malicious software to the user's computer. An attacker is then able to gain control or access to information stored on that computer and the network it is attached to. In some cases, the extent of control that hackers are able to maintain over compromised computer networks is extensive. Botnets can be created, which are networks of compromised computers through which a hacker is able to monitor web traffic and access confidential information over a sustained period of time. According to NATO and the US government, the volume and sophistication of both cyber attacks and cyber exploitation is rising (Gebauer 2012, Strohm and Shields 2013).\n\nCyber security can be further conceptualised by considering the motivations of the attacker and the choice of target. In this respect, it is useful to divide cyber security issues into four main categories: cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. First, cyber crime is a growing cause for concern for NATO members. The vast majority of attacks in this area are carried out by private individuals or groups, directed against private individuals and businesses, and take the form of identity theft and financial fraud. In this respect, the motivation for the attacks is usually financial gain. According to the annual Norton cyber crime report, global cyber crime cost $113 billion dollars in 2013 with 378 million total victims (Norton 2013). In both Europe and America, cyber crime is a widespread problem. A recent survey suggested 12% of European internet users have had their social media or email account hacked, while 7% have been the victim of credit card or banking fraud online (European Commission 2014). In the US, financial losses from cyber crime may constitute as much as 1% of US GDP (Paresh 2013). While this is not a military threat, the rapid growth of organised online crime is being viewed as a serious threat to the national security of NATO members (National Security Council 2014).",
    "Cyber espionage, as conducted by state actors, is another category of malicious online activity. This involves state controlled or directed cyber attackers targeting private businesses and foreign governments in order to steal sensitive information for commercial, political and military gain. Cyber crime is different from cyber espionage in that the former is conducted by private individuals or groups, and the latter is conducted by (or on behalf of) a state in order to enhance that state's knowledge and capabilities. Espionage is not a new security challenge and nations have always tried to covertly obtain information from their adversaries. Nevertheless, the advent of a global network of interconnected computers changes espionage dynamics profoundly. As Mohan (2013) explains, in reference to recent revelations about Chinese hacking: “That corporations spy on each other within and across nations is not new. It is the Chinese military's decision to deploy massive cyber resources against the US companies that is startling. China's massive cyber efforts have begun to blur the distinction between commercial espionage and national security.”\n\nChina's common counterclaim is that such accusations are themselves politically or commercially motivated and the Chinese government has often stated that there is no evidence linking attacks to the Chinese state (Anon 2013). Nevertheless, the scope of the problem, particularly for the US, is extreme. It has been estimated that in 2007 the US Department of Defense lost between 25 and 27 terabytes of data from its systems, which is about 5000 DVDs of information (Klimburg 2011, p. 47). This kind of data extrication would have been much more difficult to accomplish in the pre-computer age.\n\nCyber terrorism is another category of cyber activity and perhaps the most difficult to define. According to Rollins and Wilson (2007, p. 3), a cyber attack can qualify as an act of cyber terrorism if (a) its effects are comparable to a terrorist attack: “when computer attacks result in effects that are disruptive enough to generate fear comparable to a traditional act of terrorism”, or (b) if the intent is to coerce political change: “Cyber terrorism exists when unlawful or politically motivated computer attacks are done to intimidate or coerce a government or people to further a political objective”. Dorothy Denning takes a similar approach, describing cyber terrorism as attacks against computer systems designed “to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives”, and as either being violent or causing “enough harm to generate fear” (2000 cited Weimann 2004, p. 4). In a wider sense, there is growing evidence that terrorist organisations are using the internet for a variety of nefarious purposes, including promoting their ideology, garnering political support and planning terrorist attacks. In Iraq after 2003 the internet became a tool for insurgents to recruit suicide bombers (Curiel 2005). Groups like Al Qaeda Hezbollah and ISIS are become increasingly adept at using the internet in operations and appear to have already developed the knowledge and skills to conduct damaging cyber attacks (Lawson 2015). Security agencies in many countries have also been given enhanced authority to monitor the internet and email communications for terrorist activity, and government agencies, national militaries and critical infrastructure providers may be vulnerable to cyber attacks from terrorist groups. While no one has yet lost their life as a result of a cyber attack -- cyber terrorism is thus a non-violent form of terrorism -- political coercion and spreading fear through such attacks are beginning to become important strategic considerations.\n\nThe final dimension of cyber security is cyber warfare. This is another area where scholars and practitioners continue to debate definitions and where a significant degree",
    "of scepticism exists as to whether the term “cyberwar” itself is a helpful or accurate term (Rid 2012a, p. 10). Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (2011a) has referred to cyber attacks against NATO members as constituting “a new form of permanent, low-level warfare”, which necessarily would require long-term security cooperation to counter. Here, it is the political nature of cyber attacks against NATO, and that foreign states appeared to be directly involved, that distinguish them from other forms of online activity. Although acts of cyberwar have not to date been violent in themselves (as with cyber terrorism), cyber operations can add significantly to military campaigns by “amplifying” kinetic effects on the battlefield (Nye 2011, p. 27). Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, which was preceded by sustained cyber attacks against Georgian government and military units, and which arguably gave Russia a significant strategic advantage, is a prominent example in recent history (Korns and Kastenberg 2008). Nation states themselves are also using cyber attacks as part of military operations and incorporating cyber security into strategic and operational planning. In this sense, cyber security is being militarised and nationalised. The US army has officially acknowledged cyber warfare as an element of strategic doctrine and has a dedicated Cyber Command, tasked with coordinating the US military's defensive and offensive cyber warfare operations, counterintelligence and protecting military networks (Miles 2011). Close links between the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and cyber attacks were identified in February 2013 (Sanger et al. 2013) and, according to a 2011 report by the US Centre for Strategic and International Studies, 33 states include cyber warfare in their military planning and organisation (Lewis and Timlin 2011).\n\nCyber attacks are also an increasingly influential part of the operational environment in which NATO member states are involved. As US Marine Lt. Gen. R.P Mills has revealed, in reference to NATO's war with the Taliban in Afghanistan,“I was able to use my cyber operations against my adversary with great impact. I was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire, to affect my operations. (cited Satter 2012)”\n\nThe cyber domain has also been visible and influential in the conflicts in Syria and Libya. NATO took the lead role in running the ISAF operation in Afghanistan since 2003 and its members have vital strategic interests in the Middle East and North Africa. If this kind of activity is taking place in theatres where NATO is deployed, then it is natural to expect NATO to have an interest in developing cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nCyber security is thus a broad concept, and distinctions between different types of cyber attack need to be made. Cyber crime is clearly an area of growth activity, although it requires civil and legal responses. NATO has never been a police organisation or a criminal justice body, and a NATO role here may not be appropriate. Cyber espionage, however, is an area where a NATO role might be both appropriate and necessary, especially given that its own networks and facilities store highly sensitive and confidential information that could be used to the political and military advantage of non-NATO members. NATO would appear to have a natural stake in working towards the prevention of cyber terrorism. It is a high-profile organisation with members that have been subject to various forms of terrorism historically, and which has previously invoked Article 5, the collective defence clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, in response to the attacks by a non-state actor on 9/11. Cyber warfare is another area where a NATO role would appear to make sense. NATO forces have been involved in a wide",
    "J. Burton\n\nrange of conflicts in the post-cold war era, and cyber operations are increasingly part of those conflicts and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.\n\nTable 1 categorises the multi-dimensional challenge of enhancing cyber security, and indicates areas where NATO may have core interests.\n\nAs well as operating in a number of different dimensions, cyber security is challenging some of the strategic thinking on which NATO is founded. First, the alliance's understanding of territory is changing. NATO has traditionally been an alliance based on defending its members from geographically proximate security threats. During the cold war in particular, emphasis was placed on the alliance's ability to hold off the Soviet Union \"... as far to the east in Germany as possible\" (NATO 1950), and even in the early post-cold war era, the geographical scope of NATO operations was self-evident. The conflicts in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) took place on NATO's physical periphery, in clearly defined (though disputed) territories, and had direct geo-political consequences for NATO members, including considerable cross-border refugee flows (Woodward 1995, p. 369). Cyber attacks, in contrast, occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet. This presents a new challenge to geographically defined and located security organisations. While there is some evidence of NATO going through a process of \"de-territorialisation\" in the post-cold war era (Yost 2010, p. 490), such as a focus on out of area operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya and anti-piracy operations in East Africa, the changing territorial dynamics of cyberspace pose significant questions for NATO's on-going strategic role. Can a geographically located alliance respond to a geographically indeterminate threat?\n\nAn interrelated problem for NATO in this area is attribution: accurately identifying who is responsible for instigating cyber attacks. When the United States was attacked on 9/11, the hijackers were quickly identified and NATO participated in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan on the basis of evidence that al Qaeda and the Taliban had been involved and complicit, respectively, in the attacks. But an intra-alliance controversy ensued over the widening of the War on Terror to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. As German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in August 2002,\n\nTable 1. Cyber security by target, category and motivation.\n\n|   | Cyber crime (criminal motivation) | Cyber espionage (enhance state capabilities) | Cyber terrorism (political coercion, to cause fear) | Cyber warfare (enhance military operations)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Target of cyber attacks:  |   |   |   |   |\n|  Private individuals | x |  |  |   |\n|  Business (non-critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Business (critical infrastructure) | x | x | x | x  |\n|  Government departments/facilities |  | x | x | x  |\n|  Military/defence forces |  | x | x | x  |\n\nCore NATO role - xxx\nPeripheral NATO role - xxx",
    "Our analysis shows that the threat comes primarily from Islamic terrorism. To date no one can rule out another major attack. Nor, however, has anyone proved so far that Saddam Hussein has any links with organisations such as al Qaeda. (cited Loewen and Nabers 2005)”\n\nThis was, at least in part, a problem of attribution, caused by having to face a transnational adversary that was not operating from a fixed geographical location. A similar challenge exists with respect to cyber security. Recent advances in “cyber-forensics” have allowed investigators to trace attacks to particular sources, but compared to fingerprints and other forms of physical DNA, these capabilities are imprecise (Nicholson et al. 2012). As NATO itself has recognised, “Attribution in Cyber-attacks proves extremely difficult to obtain and evidence is hard to capture” (NATO 2013). The aforementioned revelations about PLA involvement in cyber attacks against US companies and government facilities are illustrative of this dilemma. The attacks were traced to a specific building in Beijing, but proving or asserting individual, institutional and governmental complicity remained problematic. The attribution problem was also demonstrated in the more recent cyber attacks against Sony Pictures in 2014. The US government claimed North Korean involvement, but did not reveal specific digital evidence, and some cyber security experts pointed the finger at disaffected former employees of the Sony Corporation (Kiss 2014). There is also increasing evidence to suggest that states are supporting sub-state or state-affiliated actors in carrying our cyber attacks, such as networks of semi-autonomous “patriot hackers” (Klimburg 2011, p. 44). This makes attribution even more difficult and allows states to maintain a level of plausible deniability.\n\nAnother strategic conundrum that NATO faces in the cyber realm is its ability to deter cyber attacks. NATO has always been an organisation based on building and maintaining a deterrent, both through nuclear weapons and conventional capabilities. During the cold war, military planners aimed to punish the enemy in the event of an attack -- through retaliation, deny their enemy the ability to fulfil the objectives of a military strike -- through dispersion of targets, for example, and/or compel an enemy to desist from attacks -- through economic, political or military inducements. After the demise of the Soviet Union, deterrence continued to be a central part of NATO doctrine and was prominent in the 1991 Strategic Concept (NATO 1991). Even in the post 9-11 era, NATO held on to this concept in confronting terrorism. The 2003 Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism, for example, was based on “... the assumption that it is preferable to deter terrorist attacks or to prevent their occurrence rather than deal with their consequences” (NATO 2002). Deterrence was also absorbed into specific counterterrorist operations, such as Operation Active Endeavour, a naval exercise in the Mediterranean that was intended to “... deter, defend, disrupt and protect against terrorism” (NATO 2010b).\n\nBut NATO may not be so well placed to deter attacks in cyberspace. Tang Lan and Zhang Xin have argued that “the anonymity, the global reach, the scattered nature, and the interconnectedness of information networks greatly reduce the efficacy of cyber deterrence and can even render it completely useless” (Lan and Xin 2010, p. 1). Similarly, James Lewis has outlined how asymmetric vulnerabilities to attack, new classes of opponents with very different tolerance of risk, and the difficulty of crafting a proportional and credible threat, all erode the ability to deter in the cyber and space domains (2012 cited Anon 2012). A number of other weaknesses exist in the cyber deterrence framework. Nuclear weapons are capable of causing absolute devastation against a",
    "potential attacker. The possible scale and impact of cyber retaliation is, at least at current levels of cyber capabilities, far lower. Escalation is another option, whereby a cyber attack would be met by a conventional military response, such as a missile strike. These questions have been on NATO member's agendas. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan, for example, has said that, “A response to a cyber-incident or attack on the US would not necessarily be a cyber-response. All appropriate options would be on the table if we were attacked” (2011 cited Spillius 2011). However, if cyber attackers can remain anonymous, and continue to be free from any legal censure, and if NATO cannot reliably punish cyber attackers, deny the attackers the ability to mount attacks, or compel them to desist from mounting attacks in the first place, a NATO role in cyber security may not be an effective one.\n\nThese strategic issues are central to whether NATO can be an effective organisation in responding to the growing threat from cyber attacks and pose a number of important questions. Can NATO overcome the changing territorial dynamics of cyber security? Can attacks against NATO members be reliably attributed to specific actors? Can NATO deter cyber attacks?\n\n## NATO's institutional adaptation\n\nExplanations of NATO's evolving post-cold war role can be divided into three main theoretical camps. Realist and neorealist scholars have emphasised the continuity of external threats and have viewed the perpetuation of NATO as being based on the US desire to control and influence European members of the alliance (Walt 1997, Gelpi 1999, Waltz 2000). Institutionalist scholars have emphasised the adaptability of NATO to new security challenges and emphasised such concepts as path dependence and institutional “stickiness” as explaining NATO's perpetuation, which is to say that the adaptation of NATO structures has been seen as preferable to the reinvention/reestablishment of the alliance (Tuschoff 1999, Wallander 2000, Thies 2009). Constructivist scholars have focused more on NATO's common identity as a community of democracies and the desire to expand that community to Central and Eastern Europe (Risse-Kappen 1996, Schimmelfennig 1999, Van Ham 2001). Arguably, all three of these approaches are of utility in expanding NATO's emerging cyber security role. NATO members have consistently emphasised the threat from cyber attacks, and that the threat comes from state and state-supported actors (realism); there has been a concerted effort to adapt NATO's institutions, operations and doctrines to respond to cyber attacks (institutionalism); and cyber attacks cannot be separated from identity politics, even when the identity of cyber attackers is hard to establish (constructivism).\n\nThis section of the article combines insights from realist and institutional approaches to alliance transformation and argues that cyber threats have driven institutional change within NATO. In this respect, NATO has been under pressure to adjust its functions and design to deal with changing environmental demands (Dijkstra 2015, p. 130). This process of evolution has taken place slowly and incrementally and has been only one facet of a broader adaptation on the part of the alliance to a diversifying and globalising security environment. It should also be noted that institutional adaptation is not a guarantee of effectiveness (Menon and Welsh 2011). Nevertheless, NATO's institutional strength and adaptability has made it a useful tool for dialogue, policy development and decision-making on cyber security within the Euro Atlantic area, and created opportunities for developing unified positions on the core issues.",
    "More specifically, there appear to have been four drivers of this process of institutional evolution. First, NATO has taken steps to enhance its cyber security due to its operational experiences, including in Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan from 2003 and Libya in 2011. These conflicts have taken on a cyber dimension and NATO has had to incorporate cyber into strategic planning as a result. Second, the events of 9/11 created serious concerns within NATO over cyber terrorism (and terrorist use of the internet more broadly) and this has driven NATO's cyber security focus. Third, geostrategic rivalries with Russia and China have taken on an increasingly online dimension and NATO has responded accordingly. Fourth, the volume and severity of cyber attacks against NATO itself and its members has increased rapidly in the last decade. These changing dynamics have given NATO's political leaders incentives to enhance NATO's cyber security capabilities and created “triggers” for institutional change (Cortell and Peterson 2002).\n\nCyber security first appeared on NATO's formal agenda at the 2002 Prague Summit, where NATO members committed to the “Initiation of measures to strengthen defence against cyber attacks” (NATO 2003). This new focus stemmed from the conflict in Kosovo in 1999, where pro-Serbian hackers had targeted NATO communications infrastructure with a view to affecting its war fighting capabilities. A NATO website responsible for promoting NATO's role in the conflict was subjected to sustained DDoS attacks from Serbian hackers, and Chinese hackers targeted NATO members in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, leading to the White House website being taken offline for three days (Messmer 1999). The summit highlighted NATO's “ability to adjust to new priorities and to adapt its capabilities in order to meet new challenges” (NATO 2003). This process of change was described as part of an “evolution” and was to occur “incrementally”, “on a continual and deliberate basis” (NATO 2003). In a more concrete sense, the 2002 summit established an institutional capacity to respond to this growing concern. A NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) was formed and the NATO Cyber Defence Programme was established.\n\nNATO also took on a more active role in the fight against terrorism at this time. (Ringsmose and Rynning 2011). The new commitment to cyber defence at the Prague summit was referred to as being part of a “package of measures ... to strengthen NATO's capabilities to defend against terrorism” (NATO 2003) and was endorsed when the alliance was grappling with its response to 9/11, the US intervention in Afghanistan, in which several NATO members took an early lead role, and in the context of a changing US national security strategy that placed counterterrorism at its core. The US government was also instituting domestic reforms at this time that influenced the NATO process. In October 2001, the Bush administration signed the Patriot Act into law, which enhanced the government's domestic and foreign surveillance powers, established the National Electronic Crime Task Force, extended government powers to intercept and access electronic communications, and enhanced America's digital forensics capabilities. Perhaps most significantly, the Act included provisions for classifying computer crimes as acts of terrorism for the first time (Podgor 2002). Further to this, the Bush administration created the Office of Cyberspace Security in the White House and appointed prominent counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, to lead it. The newly created Department for Homeland Security was also given a statutory cyber security role. Tom Ridge, its first Director, highlighted the extent of the US government's concerns at this time: “Terrorists can sit at one computer connected to one network and can create worldwide havoc. [They] don't necessarily need a bomb or explosives to cripple a",
    "sector of the economy or shut down a power grid” (2003 cited Weimann 2004). This may have been an example of cyber security hyperbole, but the fear created by 9/11 and the prospect of terrorist groups developing sophisticated cyber attack capabilities were significant drivers of the US government's response to cyber security issues in the early post-9/11 period and influenced NATO's growing role in this area of policy.\n\nThe NATO summit in Riga in 2006 further endorsed the need to continue efforts to enhance NATO's cyber security and emphasis was placed on securing NATO's own information systems against cyber attack (NATO 2006). Arguably, however, a broader NATO role in the cyber security of its members was still on the backburner. The 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, however, elevated the issue of cyber security within the alliance and shifted NATO's focus away from cyber terrorism to a focus on the threats posed by nation states and state-sponsored hackers. The attacks were thought to be a response to the removal of a monument to the Soviet liberation of Estonia, and took place over a sustained period of three weeks. All of the Estonian government's websites were shut down, along with the sites of two major banks, a number of political parties and three of the country's biggest news media organisations. From a strategic point of view, the attacks demonstrated a number of the problems outlined in the previous section, particularly the issue of attribution. The Estonian government accused the Russian government of instigating the attacks and saw Russia's refusal to participate in official investigations as confirming a level of culpability (Tikk 2011, p. 122). NATO officials strongly suspected Russian state involvement, but found no direct evidence of a link. One NATO spokesperson said, “I won't point fingers. But these were not things done by a few individuals. This clearly bore the hallmarks of something concerted” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). The Estonian attacks also prompted a vigorous and prolonged internal debate within the alliance as to whether a cyber attack could form the basis of an Article 5 commitment. Estonia's defence Minister acknowledged that,“At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country. (2007 cited Traynor 2007)”\n\nHowever, the sustained cyber assault was widely viewed as a violation of Estonia's sovereignty and even an encroachment on its territorial integrity. As Linnar Viik, a consultant to the Estonian government, asserted, “... this is not some virtual world. This is part of our independence. And these attacks were an attempt to take one country back to the cave, back to the Stone Age” (2007 cited Finn 2007). Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip asked, “What's the difference between a blockade of harbours or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government institutions and newspaper websites?” (2007 cited Rid 2012b). NATO also recognised the severity of the problem, with one Brussels-based official stating: “This is an operational security issue, something we're taking very seriously. It goes to the heart of the alliance's modus operandi” (2007 cited Traynor 2007). In 2007, however, NATO was some way from establishing whether cyber attacks constituted an “armed attack” as stipulated in Article 5, and implementing a collective response to the attacks was problematic given the difficulty of attribution. Nevertheless, the incident formed the basis of a more unified alliance approach to cyber security and the development of enhanced capabilities (Crandall 2014, p. 37).\n\nThe cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007 were not an isolated example of the evolving cyber threat. A number of other serious incidents raised the profile of cyber",
    "security within NATO member states in late 2007 and 2008 and fuelled attention to strategic vulnerabilities within the transatlantic community. In August 2007, it was reported that Chinese hackers had broken into the networks of the German Chancellery and three other Berlin Ministries, and in November 2007 British intelligence agency MI5 stated that the PLA had been conducting a concerted campaign of cyber espionage against British businesses. In June 2008, Lithuania faced a barrage of cyber attacks after it vetoed an EU energy partnership deal with Russia. The Russian war against Georgia in August 2008 also featured Russian-based hackers using cyber attacks as a precursor to the invasion in order to create confusion among Georgian military units and government ministries and to prevent a coordinated response to the assault (Hollis 2011). Lastly, in November 2008, the US Pentagon issued a ban on all external hard drives after a USB drive was used by a foreign intelligence agency to upload spyware and data exfiltration software to Defence Department computers (NATO 2009).\n\nThis growth in malicious cyber activity in 2007--2008 created a window of opportunity to develop multilateral mechanisms to respond to cyber security threats and various such measures were put in place over the course of 2008. In January that year, as a direct result of the Estonia attacks, NATO members endorsed a new Cyber Defence Policy, and in March the North Atlantic Council (NAC) established the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA). The CDMA aimed to integrate the alliance's cyber security functions and provide support for NATO members in the event of cyber attacks. A NATO spokesperson described the role of the centre as, “defence, whether an attack comes from state, criminal or other sources” (2008 cited Grant 2008). Later in 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was established in Tallinn, Estonia. While not part of the formal NATO command structure, the centre has taken a role in advancing NATO cyber security doctrine policy and developing cyber security capabilities. It has also helped to reduce alliance-wide transaction costs through the NATO “Smart Defence” initiative. Wallander (2000) has explained how highly institutionalised alliances like NATO create “assets” which help to sustain the alliance even as the security environment changes. The formation of these bodies should be seen in this context. They have provided mechanisms for the pooling of resources, avenues for negotiations between NATO members on cyber issues, enhanced decision-making within the alliance, and created incentives for all members to develop multilateral approaches to cyber security rather than isolated national ones.\n\nThe next major institutional development for NATO was the inclusion of cyber security in the November 2010 Strategic Concept, the third such Concept to be released in the post-cold war era. This was another important milestone for the alliance and a firm indication that NATO members considered cyber security to be an important area of focus. The concept emphasised “the next phase in NATO's evolution” and the need for “continuous reform” to meet modern security challenges (NATO 2010a). On cyber security specifically, it stated that cyber attacks were not just a national problem, but a collective threat to the “prosperity, security, and stability” of the whole of the Euro Atlantic area, recognising that such attacks were becoming, “more frequent, more organised and more costly in the damage that they inflict on government administrations, businesses, economies and potentially also transportation and supply networks and other critical infrastructure” (NATO 2010a). Interestingly, while the concept made reference to NATO's “ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyber-attacks” (NATO 2010a), the notion of deterrence was notably absent.\n\nNATO's institutional adaption to the threat of cyber attacks continued with the adoption of a revised Cyber Defence Policy in 2011, which placed emphasis on minimum",
    "requirements for cyber defence of national networks and an integrated system of cyber governance within NATO, with the North Atlantic Council as the ultimate driver of NATO policy and cooperation in this area. The revised policy was another landmark in NATO's strategic thinking on cyber security, highlighted the need for pragmatic responses to cyber attacks (not being constrained by Article 5, for example), and recognised the importance of prevention of and resilience to attacks (NATO 2011). The establishment of a Rapid Reaction Team in 2012 was also noteworthy. A team of six NATO computer experts were tasked with responding to cyber attacks in real time and re-establishing computer network functionality in the event of cyber attacks and/or network exploitation.\n\nA further notable contribution to NATO's adaptation to cyber security challenges was the publication of The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in March 2013. This document was produced by team of legal and technical experts working in conjunction with the CCD COE and aimed to codify and clarify possible responses to both the legal and strategic dilemmas around cyber attacks by apply existing international law to the cyber security arena. The document has advanced NATO's legal and strategic thinking on key cyber security issues, including on the problem of attribution, where it argues that states should bear some responsibility for cyber attacks emanating from within their jurisdiction. There are areas, however, that are underexplored in the document, including legal prohibitions on attacks that do not constitute a use of armed force and which take place outside of armed conflict (which still constitute the vast majority of cyber attacks), and kinetic-to-cyber operations, where conventional force might be used to destroy digital infrastructure (Fleck 2013, p. 322).\n\nFinally, in September 2014, at its summit in Cardiff, NATO members endorsed the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy. In many ways, this was the culmination of the policy debate that was started within NATO by the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As a result of the policy, NATO will consider (and potentially implement) a collective Article 5 response to cyber attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. This landmark in NATO's cyber security evolution is not without its problems. Uncertainty remains as to how a collective response can be implemented when attribution is problematic, and it is not clear what threshold a cyber attack would need to meet to trigger an Article 5 response. Minor intrusions into NATO networks are clearly not what NATO policy-makers have in mind. However, cyber attacks with a severe impact on the economy, critical infrastructure and national security of NATO members may well fall into this category. As Jamie Shea, head of NATO's Emerging Security Challenges division, has stated: “We are keeping that ambiguous so a potential aggressor does not get the idea they can carry out cyber attacks up to a certain level with impunity” (2014 cited Washford 2014). It is also unclear what a collective cyber response by NATO would actually look like. NATO does not have the authority to implement sanctions against states for cyber attacks; digital retaliation is difficult although not impossible, as can be seen in the case of the (still unclaimed) attacks against North Korea in response to the Sony hack; and an attack using conventional force, which has not been ruled out, would clearly need to be proportional to the original offence. Nevertheless, 15 years after NATO first experienced cyber attacks, the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy had brought cyber security firmly inside the purview of NATO's evolving responsibilities. It has indicated that the alliance will respond deliberately and proportionally to any significant attack depending on the extent of the damage, the level of attribution, and the motives and identity of the attackers (Abrial 2011) (Table 2).",
    "Defence Studies 309\n\n# NATO's cyber security doctrine\n\nAlthough this institutional change has occurred incrementally, and has been driven by a diverse set of events and actors, cyber security appears to have found a foothold in NATO's doctrine for the defence of its members and for the general employment of NATO power in the post-cold war era. But what do these institutional developments tell us about NATO's collective cyber security doctrine? How do these capabilities, policies and institutions actually shape how NATO acts in cyberspace, and do they constitute a unified or uniform approach to cyber security across the transatlantic region?\n\nNATO's first priority has always been to defend the North Atlantic area, and, even though cyber threats emanate from cyberspace, the alliance's doctrine is still, for the most part, focused on the protection of its own computer networks. NATO's cyber command is centrally located in Brussels, where the CDMA and NCIRC provide coordination, real-time monitoring capabilities and intelligence sharing functions (Hughes 2009), and alliance officials are aware of the need to protect NATO's digital infrastructure spread across its many international sites. While NATO has taken a broader role in cyber defence as a result of the recent adoption of the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, its own operational security is paramount.\n\nSecond, NATO's cyber security doctrine and posture is still largely defensive. The alliance has not been involved in developing offensive cyber attack capabilities. These sorts of capabilities remain the purview of the national intelligence and security institutions of individual members. It may be that NATO's political and military command would be informed if a NATO member was involved in conducting offensive cyber security operations, especially if it was part of a wider NATO mission, but at the present time NATO's cyber command is not envisaged as having such a role.\n\nThird, although deterring cyber attacks is clearly not as straight forward as deterring conventional attacks from state actors, NATO cyber doctrine appears to be based in deterrence by denial. Given the difficulty of retaliating against cyber attackers and the inability to compel attackers to desist from attacks, denying them the ability to achieve their objectives has become the focus. NATO will make it as difficult as possible to infiltrate its systems and make sure hackers are aware that they are unlikely to be able to achieve their intended effects (Healey and van Bochoven 2012). Jamie Shea has recently highlighted the utility of this defensive posture (NATO 2010c).\n\nTable 2.

    "Fourth, NATO's cyber security posture is now based primarily on states and state-sponsored hackers. While NATO has clearly been influenced by the diffusion of power and influence away from the state in the post-cold war era, and particularly threats from terrorist groups and non-affiliated hackers, concerns about Russia and China have contributed to a revised sense of state adversaries during this period. Despite NATO's preponderance of power in other areas, its strategic rivals have proved highly capable in the cyber security arena. General Keith Alexander, head of the US Cyber Command, has described Russia as a “near peer” in terms of its cyber capabilities (2010 cited Giles 2011) and Giles (2011, p. 54) has argued both China's and Russia's emphasis on semi-autonomous agencies in cyber security operations gives them a distinct advantage over the US and its allies. Russian and Chinese-based hackers have regularly targeted NATO's networks in response to political disputes, most recently in response to NATO's stance on the Ukraine crisis (Croft and Apps 2014), and both countries have an interest in exfiltrating the confidential, operational, strategic and political information that flows through NATO networks. Although some attempts have been made to enhance cyber security cooperation between NATO and Russia, such as dialogue at the NATO-Russia Council level (Bendiek 2014, p. 12), the Russian annexation of Crimea and on-going efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine, which have taken place alongside new cyber attacks against NATO members, have put any meaningful cooperation on cyber issues on hold. The US Justice Department's indictment of five member of the PLA in May 2014 has similarly stalled any attempt to cooperate with China on cyber issues (Schmidt and Sanger 2014).\n\nLastly, as with many other areas of NATO's security doctrine, NATO's approach to cyber security is based around developing cooperative relationships, both internally and externally. NATO has developed a range of formal partnerships in the post-cold war era that are increasingly addressing cyber security issues, including the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI), the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). Cyber Security is increasingly a component of the Individual Partnership Action Plans (IPAPs) negotiated with countries around the world, such as New Zealand, and NATO has developed enhanced links with the private sector and critical infrastructure providers in advancing cyber defence in the North Atlantic area (NATO 2014). These diverse networks of partnerships allow for global cooperation on cyber security issues and help to develop cyber security norms, standards and capabilities. In this respect, NATO's cyber security doctrine covers and is part of each of its three main operational pillars: Crisis Management (e.g. the crisis surrounding the cyber attacks against Estonian in 2007), Collective Defence (e.g. the enhanced Cyber Defence Policy) and Cooperative Security.\n\n## A transatlantic divide?\n\nNATO has frequently been beset by intra-alliance tensions and in the cyber security arena there appears to be at least some evidence of a divergence in European and US policy approaches. Recent revelations by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, for example, have exposed transatlantic tensions around surveillance, and the alleged NSA hacking of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, which led to an angry phone call between Obama and Merkel and the summoning of the US Ambassador to Germany, was a major embarrassment for the US government (Wilder 2013). The US has arguably taken a harder security stance on cyber issues since 9/11 because of its desire to protect the US homeland, and because it faces increased strategic rivalry from rival global",
    "power centres. A more aggressive cyber posture can certainly be seen in the establishment of the US Cyber Command, a unified and expanding military command structure tasked with coordinating defensive and offensive cyber operations for all branches of the US military, the deployment of the Stuxnet software against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the Patriot Act, and the mass surveillance programmes run by the NSA, including the Prism programme. The use of offensive and even pre-emptive operations by the US government has also grown in recent years, with a high number of ICT specialists employed to penetrate foreign networks (Gellman and Nakashima 2013). In 2012, Obama signed Presidential Decision Directive 20, a classified document that gave the US military the authority to conduct more aggressive cyber operations to thwart cyber attacks against US systems (Nakashima 2012).\n\nThe wealth of cyber resources and capabilities that exist within the US military and associated agencies may be a reason in and of itself why the US approach to managing cyber conflict has been dominated by that branch of the US government. Mary O Connell takes up this line of argument, suggesting that the US government has become “trapped in an ideology of militarism” (O'Connell 2012, p. 191) and claiming that “the US military today has the largest concentration of expertise and legal authority with respect to cyberspace” (O'Connell 2012, p. 187). She further notes that in 2009, following the Estonia attacks, the Russia Georgia war and the release of the Stuxnet virus, the US government “began releasing a number of policies on cyber security that were predominantly military in orientation” (O'Connell 2012, p. 188). This would seem to support the line of argument advanced by this article, that threats from state rather than non-state actors explain the elevation of cyber security as an issue within the transatlantic security community.\n\nThis hard power approach to cyber security in the US could also be explained by the rhetoric being used to describe cyber attacks in the American context. Former Defence Secretary Leon Panetta's claim that the US could face a “cyber Pearl Harbour” is a prime example of the securitisation and militarisation of cyber discourse. When there is a propensity at the highest levels of government to adopt Second World War and cold war analogies to characterise cyber conflict, this can shape US policy and doctrine in a certain direction. Shachtman and Singer (2011) argue that clear links can be found between cold war strategic thinking and the formulation of current US policy, especially the idea that cyber attacks might be met with conventional attacks; an idea “lifted” from the 1960s strategy of flexible response. Commercial and political motives might also have led to the US taking a more military-based approach to cyber security issues. They further argue that “there is a massive amount of threat inflation going on in Washington's discussion of online dangers, most frequently by those with political or profit motives in hyping the threats” Shachtman and Singer (2011). While we should be careful in suggesting that a new “cyber industrial complex” is forming in America, the huge US government spending on cyber protection for the federal government, such as a $1 billion contract awarded to Raytheon by the Department for Homeland Security in 2015, may create incentives for responses to cyber security threats to be militarised. Equally, threat inflation may displace attention from the arguably more pervasive problem of cyber crime.\n\nIn Europe, at least on the surface, a softer cyber security approach is evident. EU responses to cyber security have typically emphasised criminal and civil procedures for dealing with cyber attacks, reflecting a European preference for soft power over hard power, and there has been a broader reluctance in Europe to militarise cyberspace. The new European Union Cyber Security Strategy, for example, is based on promoting",
    "norms in cyberspace, encouraging dialogue between nations, enhancing technical capacity and resilience, and fighting cybercrime (Ashton 2013). The most controversial aspect has been the requirement for businesses in Europe, and particularly critical infrastructure providers, to report cyber attacks to a central authority. Overall though, the strategy is defensively orientated and non-militaristic.\n\nThe level of transatlantic divergence on cyber security issues should not be overstated, however. Given the impact of 9/11 on the US national security establishment, it is not surprising that the balance in America has tilted towards security over privacy in the decade or so since the attacks. In the context of the rise of China, the US pivot to Asia and an increasingly assertive Russia, the US is also bound to have an interest in staying ahead of its state competitors in cyber space. The US has shown some restraint in the use of its cyber capabilities and a recognisable commitment to the emergence of normative constraints on cyber warfare. Offensive cyber attacks were considered by the Obama administration as part of the campaign against Colonel Gadhafi's Libya in 2011, but a reluctance to set a dangerous precedent in how wars are fought, as well as a degree of concern over securing Congressional support for such strategy, meant that the campaign was limited to conventional capabilities (Schmitt and Shanker 2011). The Obama administration has also announced plans to end mass surveillance programmes and has stated that the US will cease monitoring the personal communications of European leaders.\n\nWithin Europe there are also certain states that are moving closer to the US in developing harder cyber security capabilities, and doing so outside of the NATO framework. The UK government, for example, has taken steps to merge cyber security intelligence and military operations, and the French and German militaries are both developing offensive cyber capabilities (Lewis and Timlin 2011). As previously stated, while there has been no NATO-led process for offensive cyber security, NATO's leading powers, including the US, are pursuing similar strategies domestically.\n\nCommon interests, values and threats also continue to bind American and European approaches to cyber security together. Both sides of the Atlantic advocate an open and accessible global cyber commons with minimal government restrictions, and an open internet is seen by both sides as central to driving economic growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Americans and Europeans are also unified in their approach to fighting cyber crime and securing critical infrastructure (Bendiek 2014). This general approach stands in opposition to Russia and China, who are arguably more concerned with being able to control information that could destabilise their societies and who have argued for international rights to restrict and censor internet traffic on that basis (Farnsworth 2011). While this divide may be hindering wider international cooperation, it is evidence of a level of unity on the basic issues within the transatlantic area.\n\nIntra-alliance management of cyber security issues also remains an important area of focus for the NATO allies, not least because some NATO members are clearly more concerned about cyber security than others. Estonia, the NATO member victim to the most significant attacks on its critical infrastructure, does not have the same level of cyber security concerns as Portugal, for example. But this is not necessarily an impediment to a NATO cyber security role, especially as NATO members have tended to specialise and develop niche capabilities that benefit the wider membership. Perhaps now more than ever NATO's capability aggregation role -- amassing capabilities against a common threat -- and its role in facilitating “smart defence”, are of crucial importance (Morrow 1991). Former Secretary General Rasmussen emphasised this himself in 2011, saying that “Smart defence is about building security for less money by working",
    "together and being more flexible” (Rasmussen 2011b). In an environment where NATO members' defence budgets are under strain, and where the US is concerned about a lack of European Defence spending, specialisation within the alliance will be increasingly important. NATO's Cyber Security Centre of Excellence is an example of this concept in practice, where some NATO members (Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Spain) have invested in a valuable institutional resource that is beneficial to all members. Defence cooperation creates efficiencies and lowers transaction costs; this is being achieved through NATO's institutional frameworks and potentially lowering the scope for intra-alliance divides.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile NATO has tried to come to terms with some of the strategic challenges involved in enhancing the cyber security of its members, there are still some unresolved and perhaps unresolvable cyber security issues. Reliably attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, responding to the diversity of actors involved and deterring cyber attacks, for example, will continue to be difficult and possibly intractable problems. NATO appears so far to have accepted this and adopted a cyber security posture that is pragmatic and deals with attacks on a case by case basis. Its defensive role, based around deterrence by denial, is appropriate given the reluctance to use the alliance for offensive cyber purposes, and its focus is in areas where it has a clear and compelling political and strategic interest; in cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and cyber warfare.\n\nThe defence of NATO's own digital networks continues to be of paramount importance. However, there is some evidence that the alliance is taking a wider and deeper role in cyber security in the North Atlantic area. The adoption of an Article 5 approach to cyber attacks is foremost in this regard, but the efforts that have been made to forge private sector partnerships and to develop normative and legal mechanisms for cyber security are also significant. Ultimately, cyber security remains a national responsibility for NATO members.\n\nWhat is perhaps most remarkable about how NATO has adapted to cyber security challenges is the institutional capacity the alliance has put in place. This institutional development has been driven mostly by external threats, from terrorist groups initially, but most recently by state actors, and these have accelerated the political and institutional focus on cyber security within the alliance. The alliance's integrated military command has always been one of its most important institutional assets and has historically allowed NATO members to coordinate military operations. The political integration and coordination provided by the North Atlantic Council has also been noteworthy throughout alliance history. In a similar vein, NATO now has a common cyber security capacity through which members can coordinate responses to cyber security incidents and provide channels of communication that are likely to continue to be important as cyber threats evolve.\n\nTransatlantic tensions on cyber security issues are certainly in evidence, and these stem from broader tensions between the US and Europe over the response to 9/11 and the role of the internet in surveillance. Despite this, there is a considerable degree of unity on the core cyber security challenges within the NATO membership. The balance between privacy and security will continue to be debated within NATO member states, but at this stage, this does not appear to be inhibiting a common and unified approach to at least defensive cyber operations. Whether NATO will take on an offensive cyber security posture at some stage will be an issue to monitor. The requirements of",
    "implementing an Article 5 response to a major cyber attack might provide momentum for the development of offensive capabilities to be deployed as part of a unified NATO command, but it is more likely that NATO's most prominent players will continue to develop and deploy these kinds of capabilities outside of NATO channels.\n\nFinally, it is worth returning to NATO's core functions: collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. In all these areas, a NATO cyber security role would appear to have considerable merit. Global security challenges invariably require multilateral solutions and NATO has a range of adaptable institutional capabilities that are reasonably well suited to the task at hand.\n\n## Disclosure statement\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.\n\n## Notes\n\n1.

    "abstract": "Political Science and International Relations Programme, Victoria University of Wellington, PO Box 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand (Received 23 February 2015; final version received 14 August 2015) NATO's adaptation in the post-cold war era has included a growing role in responding to cyber attacks. This article explores the definitional and theoretical problems in analysing the emerging cyber security field and seeks to provide an outline of the main strategic challenges that cyber attacks pose for NATO. The article evaluates the institutional structures and processes put in place by NATO to confront cyber threats and moves on to explore the extent of transatlantic unity around NATO's emerging doctrine for cyber defence. It is argued that NATO's response to cyber security is rooted in its prior adaptation to the changing security environment of the 1990s and the threat from international terrorism post 9-11. More recently, cyber attacks from state and state-sponsored actors have given impetus to NATO's emerging cyber security doctrine. The article finds that despite recent controversies over cyber surveillance, there is a considerable degree of unity within the alliance on the main cyber security issues. As a multilateral security organisation with a strong institutional foundation, NATO is also relatively well placed to respond to rapidly evolving cyber threats.",
